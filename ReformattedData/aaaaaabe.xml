The research explored the workplace environment and sought to gain a greater understanding of the elements that contribute to a safe and healthy workplace setting.The research methodology utilised a critical feminist framework. Thirteen women participants were involved in the research project including myself as a research participant. All participants were employed in an acute mental health facility in New South Wales. Four research methods were incorporated into the study these were focus groups, individual interviews, reflective journaling and creative expression and journaling. The study revealed a diverse range of opinion on nursing culture and profession, linking individual experience with group connectiveness, value and belonging.The findings of this research demonstrated that the women&#8217;s experience and practices as registered nurses working in mental health care were influenced directly by the management of the health service organisation and the operational leadership within the mental health facility. The data revealed five themes, these were: stress and mental health nursing practice, coping with violence, professional development, the spirit of nursing and the therapeutic relationship.Overall there were numerous links between the women&#8217;s experiences as nurses and their relationships with their colleagues, patients and the community. The results exposed professional pressures and inherent tensions within mental health nursing and highlighted an urgency to review a current health care structureThe study identified environmental factors that impacted upon the workplace and revealed a dichotomy between the nurses&#8217; perception of care and their ability to provide it. The research raised disquiet regarding violence and aggression, inadequate career structure, recruitment, retention and education. Jutxaposed to this, the research identified collegial friendship, spirituality and stress management as contributing factors to a safe and healthy workplace. Finally, the notions of teamwork, diversity and creativity were found to be intrinsically linked to job satisfaction and client outcome.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating environmental science and management: the role of system dynamics modelling</field><field name="creator">den Exter, Kristin Anita</field><field name="description">Institutional and epistemological differences between science and management present a challenge to the implementation of sustainable environmental management. Environmental problems are complex and require at least multidisciplinary, but most effectively transdisciplinary approaches for learning, understanding, decision-making and problem solving. This means building bridges between institutional and epistemological differences. The role of system dynamics modelling in integrating environmental science and management is examined in this thesis. An action research methodology is adopted where, over cycles of case studies, the practical application of system dynamics modelling is evaluated. The role of system dynamics modelling in the management of coastal sand dunes, tourism, threatened species management and water management is explored in the case studies. It has been found that system dynamics modelling is a potentially powerful tool for integrating environmental science and management, principally assisting communication between scientists and management stakeholders. System dynamics group model-building, in particular, has the potential to facilitate stakeholder learning and assist stakeholders to think holistically about the complex systems they are trying to manage. It was also found that engaging stakeholders in system dynamics group model-building process is difficult. A model of factors influencing the adoption of system dynamics group model-building has been developed from this research. The model can be applied to assess the suitability of potential case studies and identify potential weaknesses that need to be addressed if the approach is to succeed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental science</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">group model building</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and molecular evaluation of quality for malt and feed barley</field><field name="creator">Fox, Glen P</field><field name="description">Barley is the second largest grain crop produced in Australia and has two primary end uses. The first use is the premium market for malt and beer production. The second use is animal consumption. The quality of barley for the range of end uses is influenced by the cultivar itself as well as the growing environment. A detailed understanding of these factors at the genetic and biochemical levels was required to enable breeding program to select for quality improvement. A number of grain and end product quality traits were assessed for genetic and environmental affects as well as their interaction.Grain size has an important impact on quality and large plump grain is desirable for malt and feed quality. The results from the research conducted in this study clearly show that grain size was affected by cultivar and environmental conditions. Using screenings (&lt; 2.2 mm) and retention (&gt; 2.5mm) data provided information on how cultivars performed under a range of environmental conditions, which included irrigated (water unlimited) to terminal moisture stress (no in crop rain). The results showed a strong genetic component in the variation in grain size and it would be possible to select for increased grain size but also stable grain size when considering cultivars grown under adverse environmental conditions.The husk content in barley impacts on malt and feed quality. The results in this studied showed there were significant genetic effects as well as environments effects on the level of husk. In addition, it was identified that the genetic regions controlled husk expression were associated with two other quality traits, namely, resistance to kernel discolouration and resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (dormancy). These regions on chromosome 4H and 6H are also associated with previously identified dormancy genes.Hardness is a trait not usually considered when assessing barley quality but the results from this study showed there are differences in the level of barley hardness, as measured by three methods, as well as differences in the hardness gene sequence. The three hardness methods used showed that barley hardness could be measured independently of the method used, but also that there were significant genetic and environmental effects on hardness. However, the results from sequencing for allelic variation in the hardness genes showed that while there was polymorphism, and hance the transcribed protein had little effect on variation in quality. The cultivars used were malting and feed cultivars and a set of iv breeding lines targeted at malt quality. It may be possible to identify diverse haplotypes from the use of wild relatives or landraces.This study also investigated the variation in barley for cattle feed quality. Feed quality was determined using an in-sacco dry matter digestibility (ISDMD) assay in fistulated cows as well as three other laboratory assays, namely acid detergent fibre, starch and particle size. These four traits are then used to calculate Net Energy (NE) and Average Daily Gain (ADG). The results show that there were genetic and environmental effects on feed quality. The key trait was the ISDMD assay and there were significant differences between the cultivars tested. The data suggested feed quality was a measurable and definable attribute that could be used in breeding selection.The final aspect of this study compared the feed data obtained with routine malt quality traits, of friability and hot water extract. There were strong genetic and environmental effects. The malting cultivars generally had the highest level of ADG and NE. The results also showed that there were negative correlations between extract and husk, ISDMD and ADG. Positive correlations were shown between friability and hardness, extract and test weight, and there was only a slight correlation between average daily gain and extract.An important aspect of this study was the calculation of the genetic component for each trait. This was carried using spatial analysis of mixed models. It was necessary to use this approach so a true estimation of the genetic component could be calculated which would then allow for the calculation of heritability. In plant breeding, the cultivar is not a fixed effect but rather a random variable, hence it was not possible to use normal analysis of variation (ANOVA) models. Rather models were written with cultivars, like environment and field position, as random effects which will allow the effect of each random variable to be accounted for in the analysis. Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) are calculated and presented for all traits.For all the traits measured in this study, heritability values were calculated to ascertain the level of success in improving these traits through breeding. The range in heritability for grain size was 40 to 90%, husk 30 to 60%, hardness, 40 to 90%, feed quality traits 20 to 80% and malt quality traits 40 to 90%. Generally most traits exhibited a moderate to high level of heritability which indicated genetic improvement was possible through the use of appropriate genetic material.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">malt</field><field name="subject">heritability</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="subject">genotype</field><field name="subject">feed</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of psycho-social experience in chronic disease</field><field name="creator">Alexander, James McAlister</field><field name="description">This study examines the role of psycho-social factors in contributing to chronic illness, in particular Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and cancer. Research conducted over the last 50 years indicates a modest role for psycho-social factors as risk factors for these conditions. The research suggests that in combination with other modest risk factors, psycho-social factors play an equally important role. Grossarth-Maticek &amp; Eysenck (1990) gained notoriety by reporting research results which seriously question current wisdom. Grossarth-Maticek &amp; Eysenck (1990) conducted what must be considered the largest long term prospective psychological health study. They followed around 20,000 probands for 15 years in order to determine the relative contributions to health outcomes (primarily cancer and CHD) of standard medical and psycho-social risk factors. They reported an 81% accuracy of prediction of death by cancer or CHD with the use of a psychometric test. Further, answers to the test were reported to be six times more predictive of cancer or CHD than were any of the standard medical risk factors, either taken on their own or together. Being far in excess of claims made by any other researchers, the treatment/prevention implications of Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s study are far reaching. It is an important endeavor to examine possible influencing factors in these results. While scientific fraud can never be excluded, in the absence of any incriminating evidence, this assertion is considered to be non-empirical. Amelang (1991) wonders whether unknown, favourable and non replicable conditions were present in Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s samples or methodology which influenced the results. The current research program represents an attempt to ascertain what some of those factors may have been. It is suggested here that Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s probands learnt of their cancer or CHD proneness in the course of the interview which formed the basis of the data collected in their study. Focusing on this aspect of Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s data collection methodology, the possibility of a large scale treatment effect emerges. The most psychologically vulnerable of his probands, having been stimulated by the interview process, may have ruminated and &#8216;catastrophized&#8217; over their health prospects during the ensuing years, thereby making themselves physiologically more vulnerable to the feared conditions. The possibility of probands being adversely influenced by the interview is tested in the current study with subjects being measured for changes in cancer/CHD risk perception and anxiety levels as a result of participation in the &#8216;Grossarth-Maticek interview&#8217; format. In order to test this hypothesis, two studies were undertaken in which Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s data collection method was replicated with 105 subjects. Subjects were assessed on a range of self report items prior to the &#8216;Grossarth-Maticek&#8217; interview, and again post to this interview. They were assessed as to their beliefs about vulnerability to cancer and CHD; and their levels of anxiety in relation to contracting these conditions. Subject&#8217;s responses to learning of their &#8216;health prediction&#8217; according to Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s assessment tool were also measured via a heart rate monitor. Changes in subject&#8217;s self report measures and heart rate responses were noted and associations to the type of health prediction which they were given at the end of the interview was assessed. In the second study, the relative effects of family history, Neuroticism and time on disease risk perception and anxiety were studied via statistical analyses of self report measures. The results of this study do not support the notion of the interview having any adverse influence. Problems with the methodology and sample selection may have influenced the outcome. It is concluded that for these reasons, the current study did not represent a thorough test of the current hypothesis. Recommendations for a superior test of this hypothesis are made.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What drug problem? Cannabis and heroin in an alternative community</field><field name="creator">de Launey, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">Does Nimbin have a drug problem? This tiny village in north-eastern NSW has an international reputation for its alternative community and its street drug market. Ever since the Aquarius Festival thirty years ago Nimbin has fascinated the media, and recurrent headlines about the village's (undefined) 'drug problem' suggested my research topic. My research aim was to investigate the meaning/s of Nimbin's 'drug problem' in the context of Nimbin's 'alternative' culture. Because the topic of illicit drugs is both ethically challenging and highly sensitive, my research design was strongly participant-focused, with an emphasis on confidentiality balanced by a mixed methodology to cross-validate results. My methods included an anonymous household (door-to-door) survey based on a national household survey; an anonymous mailed-back survey of Nimbin and Lismore drug injectors; taped interviews with health and legal professionals, cannabis activists and drug dealers; semi-structured interviews with 'professional' cannabis crop growers; and participant observation over several years. I found the multi-method research design to be particularly effective for investigating illegal drug marketing and use, and the design provided me with multiple perspectives on a complex issue. Superficially, there appeared to be two drug 'problems' in Nimbin &#8212; one was the (largely cannabis) street market, and the other revolved around heroin users, and included complaints about scruffy-looking people hanging around the main street, or overdosing in the public toilet. However, my research suggested that these issues, while immediately comprehensible as 'drug problems', obscured more complex issues. For example, the village's street drug market was intertwined with the local economy and with the alternative community's values and drug use, while close to half of the drug injectors lacked secure housing (which creates problems that are not related to heroin), and all heroin users were blamed for the actions of few. Many factors influence the creation and maintenance of what we might call 'problems', and drugs are frequently blamed for broader social problems. What is Nimbin&#8217;s drug problem? The answer depends, in part, on the drug of interest, but more importantly it depends on your definition of a &#8216;problem&#8217;. Some useful and meaningful perspectives on this important social issue include quantified indicators such as death, injury, arrest rates, the economics of black markets, the demographics of drug use, and estimates of &#8216;social costs&#8217;. Qualitative perspectives include people&#8217;s opinions about drugs, media-generated moral panics, the effects of social marginalisation, and the role of drug cultures. A number of &#8216;drug problems&#8217; arise as a direct result of drug illegality. They include black markets, corruption, drug-related violence, theft, stronger forms of the drug, and more dangerous using practices (with the risk drug overdoses and HIV/AIDS), as well as public nuisance issues. Government policy, judicial sentencing and public opinion are moving towards the social reintegration of illicit drug users, but this is almost invariably counter-balanced by a toughening of legal sanctions against supply of the same drug. Most discussions about illicit drugs fail to consider the long-term implications of harsh penalties for, and elaborate and punitive police operations (such as occurred throughout my Nimbin research) against, small-scale independent growers and dealers. The only way to directly engage with drug markets and all the attendant problems, is to legitimise and regulate the supply of recreational drugs. I discuss several examples of the important role of the drug culture in mitigating problems caused by illegality. One example is the influence of Nimbin's alternative community on the style of the drug market. The village drug scene more closely resembles the many north coast village craft markets, than it does Kings Cross, Cabramatta or New York's Bronx. Buyers are north coast locals, along with national and international tourists (the small village is known to cannabis users world-wide, both through media attention and word-of-mouth). Nimbin offers a 'safe' village market ambience and competitive prices to a mainly cannabis using clientele. I suggest that there are two major underlying influences on the experience of a &#8216;drug problem&#8217;, regardless of the drug or the place. They are: 1. Political influences &#8212; specifically the effects of government policy on black markets, law enforcement practices, and access to services and resources; 2. Cultural influences &#8212; particularly the beneficial effects of norms and functional role models for the safe use of a drug, cultural effects on the drug market, and the role/s of the drug in the day-to-day life of the culture. These influences can operate with, or despite, each other, and can create or ameliorate many &#8216;drug problems&#8217;. In the case of Nimbin&#8217;s alternative culture, government policy has created a number of drug problems and the counter-culture has worked to minimise them. In my research into Nimbin&#8217;s &#8216;drug problem&#8217; I have clarified some issues and raised a number of others. I have examined the notion of a &#8216;drug problem&#8217; from several perspectives using a range of research tools, and discussed some key influences on the problem associated with drug use. Drawing from the Nimbin research and my reading, I suggest legalising the recreational drugs to bring them under the dual controls of supply legislation and social norms. In conclusion, I suggest that we need to be very clear about what &#8216;drug problem&#8217; it is that we are talking about, and indeed, whether the problem is really about drugs at all.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug culture</field><field name="subject">heroin</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">illicit drug use</field><field name="subject">Social and Behavioral Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boys' self-esteem: the effect of co-educational schooling</field><field name="creator">Bell, Kevin Phillip</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the changes in self-esteem of adolescent boys going through the school transition from a single-sex to a co-educational environment. The study combined an initial quantitative study followed by an in-depth qualitative study. The quantitative study used the Coopersmith self esteem instrument to measure the self-esteem of boys in Years 7 and 8 in the last year of the all boys' school. The same instrument was used twelve months later on the same students in Years 8 and 9 after the school had undergone the transition to co-education. Analysis of the data indicated that the boys' overall self-esteem had dropped significantly. The second part of the study was a qualitative study to investigate more fully the effect of the transition on the boys at the school. This part of the study was based on data collected from interviews with twenty seven boys and nine staff, as well as various informal interviews and observations made by the author over the period 1998 to 2004. The qualitative study used the principles of grounded theory (Glasser &amp; Strauss, 1967) to draw out the factors and related phenomena to crystallize why the boys' self-esteem may have been adversely affected. Through this process, three key factors emerged; Everybody's Looking at Me (reflecting social self-esteem), Girls Hold You Back a Step and Academic Stuff (both reflecting academic self-esteem). The qualitative study pointed to why the boys may have felt less favourably about themselves in the co-educational environment. These findings are discussed in detail in relation to the extant literature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self esteem</field><field name="subject">adolescent boys</field><field name="subject">co-education</field><field name="subject">single sex school</field><field name="subject">boy's education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/55</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A research model for the scientific investigation of homoeopathy</field><field name="creator">Baker, Don G</field><field name="description">Homoeopathy is a controversial form of medicine that is governed by the premise that highly diluted substances that can a defined set of symptoms in a healthy person can cure a similar set of symptoms in a non-healthy person. The use of highly diluted homoeopathic substances that may no longer be expected to contain any trace of the original substance is contrary to accepted pharmacological theory. In addition to serial dilution, homoeopathic &#8220;potentisation&#8221; of substances also includes violent agitation of the substance at each dilution step, a process known as &#8220;succussion&#8221;. The role of this process is not understood. The fact that the mechanism of action of homoeopathic substances is unknown adds to the controversial nature of this therapy.A review of the literature demonstrated that a more rigorous approach to the research of homoeopathy was needed in order to investigate whether homoeopathy could be investigated within a scientifically appropriate context. It was initially proposed that, through the successful replication of an existing trial, a series of clinical trials based on this replication could be conducted to test fundamental questions of homoeopathy. For pragmatic reasons, this initial approach was abandoned. A novel protocol that was subsequently designed to scientifically evaluate the effects of homoeopathy, in particular, the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, was subsequently developed.A description of homoeopathy, its development, its placement within the scientific paradigm and its role in the treatment of various clinical conditions is reviewed in Chapter 1. From this literature review, hypotheses were generated to test the effect of the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis. Chapter 2 describes the selection process and proposed replication of a prior clinical trial with a successful outcome upon which to base a further series of clinical trials to test fundamental questions in homoeopathy. The selected study was a randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to compare the effects of a complex homoeopathic preparation with the effects of paracetamol in the treatment of osteoarthritic knee pain. The study was prematurely terminated when another study presented evidence that the analgesic effect of paracetamol was no better than placebo. The uncertainty that paracetamol was no better than placebo raised doubts as to the validity of any outcome had the trial proceeded. The proposal to develop a series of clinical trials replicating the protocol of this study was postponed as a consequence.Chapter 3 describes the subsequent formation of a &#8216;think tank&#8217; consisting of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, clinical researchers in complementary medicine and homoeopaths and the subsequent development of a rigorous research protocol for the investigation of homoeopathy within the scientific paradigm. This homoeopathic research model and is described in detail.Chapter 4 describes a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with five arms designed to evaluate both the research model and the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.Chapter 5 details the results of this clinical trial. No significant difference was demonstrated between individualised homoeopathic treatment, generic complex homoeopathic treatments or placebo. Furthermore, no positive effect on treatments was demonstrated by the inclusion of a full homoeopathic consultation.Chapter 6 provides a discussion of the clinical trial. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the hypothesised outcomes and the results of the clinical trial are explored and directions for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homoeopathy - research</field><field name="subject">homoeopathic substances</field><field name="subject">homoeopathic remedies</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America and England and Wales</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Jill Irene</field><field name="description">This thesis entitled, A Comparative Study of Paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America and England and Wales, examines the role that paralegals play in the delivery of legal services and the educational opportunities that are available to support that role in Australia as compared to England (and Wales) and the United States of America (US). As in other parts of the common law world it is accepted in Australia that not all work which is of a legal nature is performed by qualified legal practitioners. This is despite a rigid demarcation between qualified lawyers and other legal workers. The structure and regulation of the legal profession have an impact in determining the nature of paralegalism in Australia. The legal profession&#8217;s monopoly in Australia is, however, confined to the right of appearance in a court of law and to the preparation of certain documents for reward, which leaves a vast field of legal tasks open to performance by other workers, including paralegals. The legal profession is facing many challenges in the twenty first century, including the need to deliver better and cheaper legal services. Paralegals, as part of the legal service industry, are affected by the same tensions but are well placed to contribute to a more &#8220;streamlined&#8221; practice and to assist in providing greater access to justice for many disadvantaged Australians.This thesis explores the difficulties for Australian paralegals given that there is little formal recognition of, or status accorded to, the paraprofession. Indeed, the word paralegal is not easily understood nor widely used and this translates into uncertainties as to qualifications, market position and function to provide a definition and to determine the parameters of the profession. Paralegals work in a variety of legal environments which include, but are not limited to, working in private legal practices where they are supervised by lawyers.Further, in order to achieve recognition and to make a meaningful contribution to legal service delivery, paralegals require specialist education. This thesis examines the educational opportunities which are available to paralegals in Australia and makes recommendations as to future accreditation based on appropriate qualifications and experience.In order to gain further insight, comparisons are made between the role that paralegals play in the delivery of legal services in two other common law jurisdictions and Australia. Paralegals play a significant role in the delivery of legal services in the US, where many states constitute bigger jurisdictions than the whole of the Australia. American paralegalism has a twenty year &#8220;head start&#8221; on that of Australia and it is reasonable to anticipate that their challenges will mirror ours in the future. England, on the other hand, has a legal system very close to our own and the examination of paralegals in both England and Wales has revealed both similarities and differences to our Australian experience, both of which inform the research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paralegal</field><field name="subject">paralegals &#8211; Australia</field><field name="subject">paralegals - United States</field><field name="subject">paralegals - England and Wales</field><field name="subject">legal executives</field><field name="subject">legal assistants</field><field name="subject">access to justice</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of evolutionary history and population structure for the analysis of quantitative trait loci in the ancient conifer Araucaria cunninghamii</field><field name="creator">Scott, Leon J</field><field name="description">Araucaria cunninghamii is an ancient tropical conifer with substantial value as a forestry species in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and has been subject to a genetic improvement program for more than 50 years. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the utility of quantitative genetic analysis in describing the genetic architecture of commercial traits in A. cunninghamii. Linkage maps were prepared using the pseudotestcross strategy in what was believed to be a wide interprovenance cross using microsatellites and AFLP. A very low rate of marker polymorphism and limited differentiation between the parental provenances was identified, resulting in low mapping efficiency. The population genetic structure of A. cunninghamii was assessed to establish the underlying causes for the limited differentiation and low marker heterozygosity and assess the implications for future analysis of quantitative traits.  Despite the limited mapping efficiency, genetic maps were generated for both parents. The maternal map for individual H15 contained 14 linkage groups comprising of 51 AFLP and one microsatellite. The map covered 1290 cM, representing 89% of the estimated genome size. The paternal map for individual Gil24 was 633 cM, consisting of eight linkage groups.  Genetic architecture of quantitative traits was examined with putative QTL identified for height, DBH and stem straightness; one was highly significant (p&lt;0.01), three significant (0.01&lt;p&lt;0.05) and 13 suggestive (p&lt;0.10). Significant QTL each accounted for 7-11% of the phenotypic variance with a high allele substitution effect (0.63-0.81). These QTL were likely to be associated with genes of moderate effect. The suggestive QTL each accounted for 3-6% of the phenotypic variance with an allele substitution effect of 0.40-0.63. Three genomic regions contributed to the expression of multiple traits at multiple ages. Stable QTL had decreasing phenotypic effects with increasing age.  The population genetic survey characterised low levels of allelic diversity across the geographic range. Three broad regions were characterised; Papua New Guinea, Cape York and northern Queensland to NSW. There was limited differentiation between provenances within these regions, and high diversity within provenances. Limited genetic differentiation between provenances seems to be the result of genetic stability due to long overlapping generations, limited founder effects and a very low mutation rate. The latter may also contribute the low heterozygosity. Limited marker polymorphism and limited differentiation between provenances within broad regions are common features in A. cunninghamii. Therefore careful parental selection and alternative experimental approaches will be required before undertaking further analysis of quantitative traits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Araucaria</field><field name="subject">hoop pine</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">tree breeding</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">conifer</field><field name="subject">linkage map</field><field name="subject">genetic mapping</field><field name="subject">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/52</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picking the pitch: a grounded theory study of the impact of equal opportunity officers on the culture of universities</field><field name="creator">Burrett, Ann Joan</field><field name="description">Equal opportunity offices have been described as agencies of organisational change, and the term &#8216;cultural change&#8217; has been used to describe aspects of equal opportunity work.Universities are sites of organisational cultures where equal opportunity officers have worked in Australia for the past decade. In this time there have been significant changes to higher education, in terms of the size of the university sector in Australia, and also in terms of funding, governance and management. These changes in universities provided the context for questions about the roles of equal opportunity officers in universities, and how they may have changed. This research investigated the practice of equal opportunity officers in universities by using a grounded theory approach to generate understandings about how this group of university staff may have impacted on university cultures. The study develops links between theories of culture and organisational change that was situated in the practices of equal opportunity officers.The research identified a central conceptual category that was described as &#8216;picking the pitch&#8217;, as the main theme in the work of equal opportunity officers in identifying issues and gaining support for a cultural change agenda. All of the preliminary themes that were identified, and the interactions, the observations and the analysis of culture were prerequisites for &#8216;picking the pitch&#8217;.The thesis uses the research for further reflection and integration of the goals of equal opportunity, and the means that were available to equal opportunity officers to achieve these goals. The interactions of power and influence, and some of the limitations on equal opportunity officers are discussed.In the thesis the usefulness of the concept of culture to equal opportunity officers is examined, along with the underpinning theories about the mind of humanity that contributed to their approach to their task.Finally, the thesis discusses the impact of the research for equal opportunity officers, and for the universities in which they worked.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">equal opportunity</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Inequality and Stratification</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/50</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional intelligence (EQ), customer service and sustainable competitive advantage: a case study to assess the importance of emotional intelligence in enhancing customer service in a Malaysian property development company, bringing about a sustainable competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Teh, Allen Keat Beng</field><field name="description">The Malaysian property development industry contends with economic challenges arising from increased competition and property glut in the market. The situation is further worsen by the onslaught of world disasters for example tsunamis, earthquakes, bird flu pandemic and terrorist attacks, thus weakening the spending power of property buyers and investors. This exploratory research therefore investigated the importance of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) in enhancing customer service for sustainable competitive advantage. Guided by an analytical framework, it reviewed the key issues in the context of customer service within the Malaysian property development industry, the existing challenges faced by Malaysian property development companies, emotional intelligence (EQ) and training and development.The identified research gaps permitted the crafting of three Research Propositions. The combined outputs from the literature review, analysis of the research data and conclusions provided useful insights on the research problem. The case study methodology, supplemented by two other categories of exploratory research, namely experience surveys and one-on-one interviews, were the research techniques used to test the research propositions.The participants involved in the experience survey and one-on-one interviews included Heads of Department from the case-study company, Frontline employees, existing clients and vendors supplying goods and services to the case-study company. The procedure of data analysis consisted of examining, categorising, tabulating and recombining the evidence to address the research problem and the related research questions.The testing, by this research, yielded useful insights on the research problem.First, in order for Malaysian property developers to gain a sustainable competitive advantage, there is a need for fresh emphasis and commitment towards customer service, placing special focus on the development of employees in the area of emotional intelligence (EQ) through the reinforcement of emotional competencies. Despite efforts to enhance customer service through training programmes, the lack of effectiveness needs to be addressed and new measures should be undertaken.Second, the need for Malaysian property development companies to understand the importance of building a service culture and to begin by formulating and implementing a service strategy and it is here that leadership plays a critical role in ensuring the success of every customer service programme throughout the entire organisation. This suggests that new approaches to creating a service culture are necessary, benchmarking with best practices of service leaders around the world, even from different industries. Third, the need for the customer service training model to be reviewed and revamped. It calls for new emphasis on the development of emotional intelligence (EQ) competencies, to ensure training effectiveness and the achievement of customer service excellence through human capital.Finally, the research findings permitted the construct of a policy framework for securing sustainable competitive advantage. The research yielded useful insights for theory and model building. In respect of enhancing customer service to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the Malaysian property development market, the research findings suggested a Service Culture Development Model that will ensure that customer service excellence can be maintained and delivered consistently, leading to a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace. In respect of enhancing customer service through the development of EQ competencies in every employee and throughout the organisation, the research findings suggested a new Customer Service Training Model, where EQ competencies development programme becomes the pre-requisite foundational programme for all employees, prior to the training of customer service skill-sets. In order to create a service culture throughout the entire organisation, a customer service-oriented organisation will ensure that all employees, including top management personnel, participate in the EQ development programme.Follow-up research to test a model, based on this framework should further contribute to new theory development in emotional intelligence impacting customer service in the Malaysian property development industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaysian property development</field><field name="subject">sustainable competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="subject">service culture</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">emotional competencies</field><field name="subject">service strategy</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of simple business models on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Featherstone, Michael</field><field name="description">This research project began with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the conduct of business on the Internet. Research regarding the overall performance of business on the Web has been limited due to several constraining factors. Firstly, the shear size, volume, and perceived complexity of business on the Web made it an imposing target for research. Secondly, the interdisciplinary nature of the field had an initial dampening effect on research activity. Kuhn (1962) describes this phenomenon as the insufficiency of methodological directives. He writes (p. 3) &#8216;Instructed to examine electrical or chemical phenomena, the man who is ignorant of these fields but who knows what it is to be scientific may legitimately reach any one of a number of incompatible conclusions. Among those legitimate possibilities, the particular conclusions he does arrive at are probably determined by his prior experience in the other fields&#8217;. Thirdly, academic interest in Web businesses was somewhat diminished by the bursting of the dot com bubble during 2000-2001 as evidenced by the fact that many academic programs in electronic commerce have been discontinued or significantly reduced (Featherstone, Ellis &amp; Borstorff 2004). Lastly, methodological issues arose which limited the application of previously available sampling methods. The impact of this meant that drawing representative samples of websites in order to examine business behaviour became a more complex endeavour. As a result, many fundamental questions regarding business on the Web have remained unanswered. For example, there has been no clear answer to the question of what new business models, if any, are evolving within the Web environment. What is the role of entrepreneurship employing the Web? What are the key elements or mechanisms driving business expansion in the Web? Some have suggested that Web use necessitates greater business cooperation than may be necessary in the non-virtual world. Is there evidence that this is so? This thesis addresses these questions. It accomplishes this by reducing the function of business on the Internet to its simplest element, the domain name, and by employing innovative methodologies to explore the business environment of the Web. Using Complexity and Network Theories as a contextual framework , and based upon a review of existing literature, this thesis develops a series of propositions regarding both the conduct and attributes of Web business, and proceeds to present evidence of confirmation or refutation of these propositions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">e-business</field><field name="subject">business models</field><field name="subject">domain names</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">network theory</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">E-Commerce</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="subject">Technology and Innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blitz: discursive bombardments in 'the war on terror'</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">This is a composite thesis realised in a sound installation titled Blitz: Discursive bombardments in &#8216;the war on terror&#8217; with a supporting exegesis. The exegesis offers a context for the project in sound art theory and practice, focussing specifically on the history of experimental &#8216;electrovocal&#8217; expressive forms. It provides an account of the artist&#8217;s perspectives on the topic itself: contemporary political discourse on themes of security and danger. The exegesis also defines the scope of the project and documents the creative process undergone to realise its outcome: an installation apparatus capable of folding visitors into a heightened sense of the zeitgeist of early 21st century Australia. The genealogy of the project is described in terms of pivotal decisions and insights, technologies and techniques used, and aesthetic and ethical concerns. The nexus of voice &#8211; its material and metaphorical resonances in public discourse &#8211; and technologies for recording, manipulating and circulating sound are central to the development of this apparatus. The core body of sounds used in the installation are the voices of politicians, media presenters, members of the public and &#8216;experts&#8217; and are presented in the form of short sound bites. These were sampled from many hours of recordings of news and current affairs material captured from Australian public broadcasters (radio and television, the ABC and SBS) over the pre-election months of 2004. The voices extol and debate diverse &#8216;angles&#8217; on the so-called &#8216;war on terror&#8217; and its physical enactments and outcomes in the war on Iraq. Other sounds offset the voices to enhance a sense of surreal ambience and introduce meanings through metaphor; children&#8217;s voices; rhythmically dripping taps; footsteps; ticking clocks; the drone of planes overhead. Various sound processing techniques are applied to samples and a sonic montage iscreated through random juxtapositions of sounds played synchronously from an assemblage of iPods. The figure of the labyrinth is central to the work on many levels, materially and metaphorically. It is used to structure movement through the installation space, a dimly lit &#8216;black box&#8217; studio of ten by eight metres. Against the traditional practice of silently &#8216;walking the labyrinth&#8217; as metaphor for a &#8216;journey within&#8217;, the Blitz labyrinth invites walkers to fold themselves into a dynamic field of allusions and aural messages and thereby to warp and shift the emerging play of meanings. The walk wends in and out of proximity to seven iPods set in small portable speakers and dispersed around the floor of the installation space. The &#8216;pods&#8217; broadcast playlists of sounds bites that play randomly in &#8216;shuffle&#8217; mode &#8211; against one another and against silences &#8211; to convey a sense of immersion in the discursive blitz of messages about terrorism and war from the media. The labyrinth is drawn out across the floor in dashed lines &#8211; made from small reflective rectangles that light up as visitors move around the space with torches &#8211; and is designed to suggest the feel of a road or a landing ground at night. The meandering trajectory of walking bodies around the curves of the labyrinth creates a choreography of audition, of moving and listening strategically to a barrage of sound from ever shifting perspectives. It invites walkers to listen for possibilities that may lie between and beyond the dominant narratives of western political leaders, to locate the gaps and silences. Beyond the pervasive noise of discourse normalised by politicians and the media, what is it that we might otherwise wish to hear and to speak?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voice</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">sound art</field><field name="subject">sound installation</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">2004</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A farewell to meat: rendering ambivalence and transgression</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Cornelius</field><field name="description">This exegesis speaks to the body of work constructed over three years between February 2004 and April 2007, assembled and exhibited at the Lismore Regional Gallery in May 2007 under the title A Farewell To Meat: Rendering Ambivalence and Transgression. Written concurrently with the production of the paintings, this writing maps the literature surveyed and documents the studio research undertaken.This research consisted of collecting imagery from a wide range of sites and allowing it to trigger abductive pictorial responses. Erupting from this collecting process, social texts such as TV and radio news, cultural texts such as cinema and literature, and the subtext formed by my own dreams and nightmares were conflated to become a kind of mythology that informs the paintings and artist books in the exhibition. My studio research on one level, became a kind of phenomenological investigation that probed and responded to a media saturated consumer culture, whilst on another level, it seeks to facilitate the injection of an element of cognitive dissonance back into this culture.The resultant creative output utilises the efficacy of the image and the subversive power of metaphor to engage with several interconnected themes. These range from the dialectic of truth and illusion in the painted space, to power relations, marginalisation and the possibility of finding holes in that maze without exits we call &#8216;capitalism&#8217;. An ostensibly atavistic utilisation of figuration and oil paint is intended as a lucid rebuttal of 20th Century/modernist notions of minimalism and the so-called &#8216;end of painting&#8217;. The relationship within the paintings between the medium and the message (the paint and the illusion) seeks to operate like the drapery found in paintings from the Baroque era that antinomically both reveals and conceals the forms beneath it. This scopic contradiction serves as an anamorphosistic mirror which, in my own work, highlights the subterfuge and legerdemain currently operating behind the veil constituted by technology and contemporary mass culture.The goofy, cartoon-like nature of the paintings and the aleatory strategies deployed in their construction, bear witness to the profundity of play in contrast to the burdensome yoke of labour. The artist books articulate more fully the innovative nature of the research and complement the paintings in a way that adds the dynamic of a digital dimension to the more traditional methods of oil painting on canvas.As a crassly instrumental reason insists on tightening its grip on human affairs, everywhere emphasising efficiency over playfulness, and as coercive structures of order continue to reduce my ontic options to an ever-diminishing range of superlatively insipid and uninteresting purchasing &#8216;choices&#8217;, the capacity for play, for ridiculousness, for absurdity, noise and laziness, for me, became symbolically central.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary theory: a 'good' explanatory framework for research into technological innovation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Stephen Keir</field><field name="description">This study attempts to answer the question; does evolutionary theory provide a &#8216;good&#8217; explanatory framework for examining the phenomenon of technological innovation? In doing so, the study critically examines mainstream marketing&#8217;s in-place explanatory frameworks, offers an explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; based on new insights from a broad range of (sub)disciplines, and makes the practical proposition that this explanation is a &#8216;good&#8217; analogous representation of the technological innovation process. As an alternative to the &#8216;scientific empiricist&#8217; approach that dominates much of marketing&#8217;s research into technological innovation, the study develops a research methodology that is based within a postmodern philosophy, adopts an epistemology of transcendental realism, bases the research design on abduction and textual explanation, and brings together a research method based on the criteria of interesting, plausibility and acceptability. Familiarisation with mainstream marketing&#8217;s explanatory frameworks for research into technological innovation identified Diffusion theory, New Product Development theory and Network theory as dominant. It is concluded that these frameworks are based on problematic theoretical foundations, a situation considered as largely due to a pre-occupation with assumptions that are atomistic, reductionistic, deterministic, gradualistic and mechanistic in nature. It is argued, that in concert with the &#8216;socialised&#8217; dominance of mathematical form over conceptual substance, mainstream marketing&#8217;s research into technological innovation is locked into a narrow range of &#8216;preordained axiomatics&#8217;. The explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; offered within the study is based on a why, what, how, when and where format. The resultant explanation represents a significant departure from the (neo)Darwinian biological perspective that tends to dominate evolutionary explanations of socio-economic behaviour, in that the focus is on the principles (and associated conceptualizations) of &#8216;variation&#8217;, &#8216;selection&#8217; and &#8216;preservation&#8217; within the broader context of open and dissipative systems. The offered explanation presents a number of theoretical ideas, and in particular, that evolution can only occur in a &#8216;multidimensional space of possibilities&#8217;, denotes a process of &#8216;adaptive emergence&#8217;, and is essentially concerned with &#8216;on-going resilience through adaptability&#8217;. The practical proposition is made that the offered explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; can be used in an &#8216;as if&#8217; manner, that is, the principles of &#8216;variation&#8217;, &#8216;selection&#8217;, and &#8216;preservation&#8217; (and the meanings ascribed to them through conceptualization) are analogically transferable to the technological innovation research area. The proposition is supported through reference to theoretical and empirical research, highlighting the similarity with respect to the generative mechanisms, structures and contingent conditions underpinning both &#8216;evolution&#8217; and &#8216;technological innovation&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytochemistry and arthropod bioactivity of Australian Lamiaceae</field><field name="creator">Rasikari, Heidi</field><field name="description">Crude foliar extracts of sixty species from six subfamilies of Australian Lamiaceae were screened by whole organism contact toxicity on the polyphagous mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). In addition, cytotoxicity assessments against insect cell lines from Spodoptera frugiperda J.E.Smith (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) and Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) were also made. The findings indicated that the Spodoptera cell line was more susceptible to extracts than the Drosophila cell line and no direct correlation was observed between the two screening methods. However, several interesting relationships were identified. Extracts from sub-families Ajugoideae, Scutellarioideae, Chloanthoideae, Viticoideae and Nepetoideae showed acaricidal activity, whilst only those from Ajugoideae and Nepetoideae displayed potent cytotoxic effects. A range of activities was observed for the 25 species of Plectranthus, 14 of which showed moderate to high contact toxicity against T. urticae. Overall, least promising bioactivity was observed for extracts from the plant subfamily Prostantheroideae, which showed little contact toxicity or cytotoxicity for the 18 extracts studied.  Greatest cytotoxicity was observed from a methanol extract of leaf material of Glossocarya calcicola Domin. Bioassay guided fractionation led to the discovery of three novel clerodane diterpenes, which were not present in the stems or at all in the closely related species G. hemiderma.  Compound 1 was characterised as (rel)-10&#226;H-trans-12&#238;-(2-methylbut-2(E)-enoyl)-1&#226;-(isobutanoyl)-6&#225;,13&#238;-dihydroxyclerodan-4(20),8(18)-dien-7,15-dione-15,16-oxide, to which the trivial name calcicolin-A was assigned. The other two compounds had the same skeletal structure and C-12 substituent but in compound 2 (calcicolin-B), the C-1 esterifying group became 2-methylbut-2(E)-enoic acid and in 3 (calcicolin-C) it became 2-methylbutanoic acid. Although insect antifeeding activity was not observed for G. calcicola, cytotoxicity against insect and human carcinoma cell lines was detected.  Greatest acaricidal activity was observed for Plectranthus diversus S.T.Blake when topically applied (LC50 = 0.25% (w/v)). The major compound present in the extract of P. diversus was identified as the known compound 7&#225;,18-dihydroxy-isopimara-8(14),15-diene. These findings were of chemotaxonomic significance as this is the first known occurrence of a pimarane diterpene in Plectranthus, a genus characterised by abietane diterpenes. A number of abietanes were isolated and identified in this study, though none of which were novel. Promising cytotoxicity was observed from P. fasciculatus P.I.Forst., which was attributed to coleon U, a known abietane diterpene with cytotoxic activity.  Other species of Plectranthus showed potential acaricidal activity as a crude extract in particular P. graveolens R.Br. (LC50 = 0.76% (w/v)). Bioassay guided fractionation did reveal some interesting behavioural effects on mites but in general the fractions were less toxic than the whole extract. The hexane-soluble components of the methanol extract were extremely effective against mites and while the mode of action was not fully understood, it is possible that a smothering effect could be the cause. A potted plant trial was also carried out for this species to determine the effects of crude extract. At time = 112 h post treatment, a concentration response in mite mortality was observed. The control and 0.5% (w/v) treatment were not significantly different to one another but had significantly larger numbers of mites than the 1.0 and 1.5% (w/v) treatment. These results showed that the crude methanol extract of Plectranthus graveolens showed acaricidal efficacy against Tetranychus urticae in a leaf disc and a potted plant trial at concentrations of 1% (w/v) or above with no phytotoxic effects.  The repellency and antifeeding effects of some plant extracts were evaluated against Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in a choice and no-choice bioassay. The most outstanding results were observed for Ajuga australis L. against both second and third instar larvae. The active constituents were present as minor compounds, thus detailed spectroscopic analysis was not adequately performed. However, the compounds were believed to be known clerodane diterpenes that have been previously isolated from this and other species of Ajuga.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic variation in cultivated coffee (Coffea arabica L.) accessions in northern New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thi Minh Hue</field><field name="description">Genetic consistency within varieties is essential to quality assurance for any agricultural product. While the Australian coffee industry targets high quality coffee, there is observed morphological variation within coffee varieties in New South Wales plantations. This variability may result from environmental, genetic and/or management factors. Genetic factors can be tested by molecular markers which can also shed light on the questions concerning crop quality management. A review of the literature showed low genetic variation in C. arabica. Hence four different molecular marker systems were used in this study to detect possible genetic variation within and between varieties of local coffee grown in Northern New South Wales (NNSW), Australia. Genetic variation in eighty-four seed propagated coffee (C. arabica) accessions, mainly from two commercial varieties (K7 and CRB) in NNSW, were tested using various PCR-based marker systems (RAPDs, ISSRs, SSRs and AFLPs). Eleven accessions from Central Highland, Vietnam, were used as reference material. While RAPD and ISSR did not distinguish intra-varietal molecular variation, SSR and AFLP data revealed the degree of genetic variability and the relationship among individuals within and between coffee varieties. Despite observed morphological variation within supposedly single variety plantations in NNSW, the genetic variation, measured by genetic distance, revealed in this study was very low (K7: 0.193; CRB: 0.205). There exists genetic variation between different farms sharing the same cultivar (K7) which suggests differences in the management of plantation establishment and sourcing of trees. The genetic variability is not aligned with off-type individuals observed in K7, but is with off-type CRB plants which is probably due to inter-varietal hybrids from unintentional outcrossing.  The mean level of genetic identity between cultivars derived from the two distinct types of C. arabica is moderate (0.641). Although genetic variation within and among arabica cultivars is low, sufficient DNA polymorphism was found among some C. arabica accessions to allow differentiation. The results in this study suggested that even the elite cultivars, which have been exposed to intensive selection, still show a certain degree of genetic variation amongst individuals within each cultivar even though C. arabica is a predominantly selfing species and has a narrow genetic foundation. The congruence between AFLP and SSR data sets suggests that either method individually, or a combination, is applicable to genetic studies of coffee. SSR alone clearly distinguished and revealed inter-varietal heterogeneity but were more powerful when combined with AFLP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant genetics</field><field name="subject">coffee</field><field name="subject">Agronomy and Crop Sciences</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproduction and recruitment of scleractinian corals on equatorial reefs in Mombasa, Kenya</field><field name="creator">Mangubhai, Sangeeta</field><field name="description">This study examined patterns of coral reproduction and recruitment on lagoonal reefs adjacent to Mombasa in Kenya, at latitude 4&#186;S. Very little detailed research has been done on the reproductive patterns of scleractinian corals on equatorial reefs, where it has been suggested that seasonality and spawning synchrony may break down due to the weak environmental cues that are thought to govern the onset and timing of reproduction. Gametogenic data were collected for three faviid (Echinopora gemmacea, Platygyra daedalea and Leptoria phrygia) and three Acropora species (A. tenuis, A. valida and Acropora sp.1) in the Mombasa Marine National Park and Reserve between April 2003 &#8211; May 2005. A further 20 species of Acropora were identified (9 species represented range extensions) and marked to examine intra- and inter-specific spawning synchrony within this genus. In comparison to other regions, the overall pattern of coral reproduction in Kenya was found to be asynchronous, with spawning occurring over 9 months of the year from August &#8211; April, with some level of &#8216;temporal reproductive isolation&#8217; occurring between species in relation to the main lunar month and lunar quarter when spawning occurred. Proximate cues governing the timing of reproduction could not be clearly discerned in Kenya with spawning occurring during both rising and maximum temperatures, during both neap and spring tides and across all lunar phases. Acropora species spawned over a 7-month period between October &#8211; April and faviid species over a 5-month period from December - April. The timing of reproduction in Acropora varied both within and among species, with the main release of gametes occurring from January &#8211; March when sea surface temperatures were at their summer maximum. Individual species released gametes over 2-5 months. The greatest overlap in spawning Acropora species occurred in February, which coincided with the spawning months of P. daedalea and E. gemmacea and suggests that some degree of multispecific spawning is a characteristic of Kenyan reefs. Within the main spawning period individual Acropora species had their main spawning in different lunar months. Acropora species released gametes in all lunar quarters, with the highest number of colonies and species spawning in the 3rd lunar quarter (i.e. in the 7 nights after full moon). Spawning in the faviids was more synchronised than Acropora species with the majority of faviid corals spawning in the 3rd lunar quarter. Single annual cycles of gametogenesis were recorded in E. gemmacea, A. tenuis, L.phrygia, most colonies of A. valida and Acropora sp.1, and in 84% of P. daedalea colonies. Biannual cycles of gametogenesis were recorded in 16% of P.daedalea colonies, which included two morphotypes identified in the Mombasa lagoon through morphometric and genetic studies. The presence of different oocyte sizes in L.phrygia during gametogenesis suggested that in some colonies there were two slightly overlapping oogenic cycles, which terminated in spawning within 1-2 months of each other. Overlapping oogenic cycles have not previously been recorded in hermaphroditic broadcast spawning corals in the tropics. The findings from Kenya support the hypothesis of protracted breeding seasons and a breakdown of spawning synchrony nearer the equator. It is hypothesised that the high fecundities recorded in faviid and Acropora species in Kenya compared to other regions, may allow reef corals to stagger their reproduction over 2-5 months, without incurring a significant reduction in fertilisation rates. Spat from the Family Pocilloporidae dominated settlement tiles in the Marine National Park and Reserve comprising 93.7% of spat, which contrasts with other tropical reefs where Acroporidae spat dominate. Patterns of settlement of Acroporidae spat generally coincided with the timing and extended spawning season in Acropora species in Kenya. The density and relative composition of coral recruits and juvenile corals on natural substrata recorded during this study were similar to those recorded before the 1997-98 bleaching event. There is no evidence to suggest that Kenya&#8217;s reefs have undergone a phase-shift in community structure, and reef recovery is occurring post-bleaching with mean percent hard coral cover currently at 25%. The slow rate of recovery of Kenya&#8217;s reefs is likely to reflect the scale of the mortality, source and availability of coral larvae as well as post-settlement processes operating at individual sites. In the medium-term, the recovery of Kenya&#8217;s reefs appears to be more strongly dependent on larvae from local reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coral</field><field name="subject">coral reproduction</field><field name="subject">coral spawning</field><field name="subject">equatorial reefs</field><field name="subject">Western Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">gametogenesis</field><field name="subject">Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/1</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abundance, behaviour and habitat use patterns of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (&lt;em&gt;Tursiops aduncus&lt;/em&gt;) in the Clarence and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Fury, Christine Ann</field><field name="description">Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are a widely studied species in marine habitats, however, information on estuarine populations in Australia is very limited. To fully understand the importance of estuaries as habitats for dolphins there needs to be clear quantitative data on dolphin populations and their habitat use in estuaries. This study provides the first published data on Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) abundance estimates, site fidelity, individual ranging patterns, habitat use, flood impacts and sexual segregation patterns over a 3- year period in the Clarence River (CR) and Richmond River (RR) estuaries in northern New South Wales, Australia.The results indicate that, at present, the CR estuary is sustaining a larger dolphin community with a predominantly resident population compared to the RR estuary, which supports a smaller community with lower site fidelity. The CR estuary dolphin abundance estimate of 71 (62-81 95% CI, CV = 0.07) is more than twice the size of the RR estuary abundance estimate of 34 (19- 49 95% CI, CV = 0.23). Differences in site fidelity were observed between the estuaries with 60% and 37% of identified dolphins determined as residents, 26% and 21% as occasional visitors, and 14% and 42% as transients for the CR and RR, respectively. Resource partitioning was apparent in both estuaries with the mean distance resident dolphins were found upstream from the River mouth being greater than for the occasional visitors and transients.Tursiops aduncus was seen all year round in the CR and RR estuaries, with peak sightings occurring in spring at both sites. In the CR the dolphin population showed consistent seasonal fluctuations, whereas this did not occur in the RR population. In the CR the largest spatial distribution of dolphins in the estuary was observed in spring and winter, while in summer they were primarily restricted to the main estuary channel. Different behaviours that were observed; feeding, socialising, travelling, and milling and resting, were found to be influenced by season, tidal phase and tidal range. In both estuaries the core habitat areas used by the population for feeding consisted of areas with considerable slope near the edge of tidal sand banks, adjacent to deeper channels at the entrances of canals, creeks or artificial breakwalls. In addition, the core habitat areas used by the population for milling and resting behaviour in both estuaries occurred in shallow, sheltered areas, often associated with seagrass beds.  Socialising occurred more frequently in the CR throughout most of the deeper waters of the estuary, whereas in the RR it was primarily restricted to a small area of medium depth in the estuary.The major determinant of T. aduncus occupancy in the two estuaries was the flood events that occurred, which resulted in the dolphins abandoning the estuary. The mean predicted probabilities for sighting dolphins during non-flood periods were 0.87 and 0.71, during a flood 0.21 and 0.04, and during a post-flood recovery period 0.83 and 0.80 in the CR and RR, respectively. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed that when the dolphins were absent from the estuaries, three components were extracted from the water quality parameters in the CR, and two components in the RR. High loadings from the PCA were associated with the changing salinity, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature associated with the flood events. The return of the dolphins to the estuary following a flood depended on the length and severity of the flood event, but generally the dolphins seemed to prefer waters with salinity levels above 29 &#8240;. This could be associated with higher salinities being important for their physiological health, or because their prey returned to the estuaries during these higher salinity conditions, more likely a combination of both of these factors.Sexual segregation patterns were observed in T. aduncus populations with mixed gender and female groups mainly recorded in the CR, whereas in the RR female groups dominated the estuary. In the CR, significant differences occurred in sightings between the mixed and female groups in relation to water depth and behaviour. Mixed gender groups were sighted predominantly in deeper water and were involved in social behaviour including sexual behaviour and male herding of females. In contrast, the female groups were observed across all water depths, predominately feeding and also participating in more milling and resting behaviours.The high occurrence of aggressive herding behaviour by males in the CR was significantly different at varying depths, tides and seasons, occurring more often in deeper water, at higher tides and in non-breeding seasons. Female groups were found to utilise the small, shallow tributaries and travel for longer distances up these smaller tributaries than the mixed groups, which were concentrated in the deeper main channel of the estuary.The deeper water of the channels may facilitate the males in herding the females, while the female groups&#8217; habitat selection of shallow estuary areas may provide a sanctuary from aggressive males, access to suitable prey items or prey density for mothers and their calves, or a combination of these factors.This study has provided the first detailed research on T. aduncus dolphin population dynamics, habitat use, occupancy and sexual segregation patterns in two Australian subtropical estuaries. To ensure the long-term survival of both of these dolphin populations, management of future increased anthropogenic disturbances from boat traffic, pollution, dolphin watching, industrial or urban development, over-fishing and habitat degradation of the catchment is needed. Good quality water conditions, the protection of the core feeding areas and small shallow tributaries for females and their calves, and sheltered areas for resting behaviour all need to be maintained for the continued conservation of these important dolphin populations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bottlenose dolphin</field><field name="subject">habitat use</field><field name="subject">Clarence River</field><field name="subject">Richmond River</field><field name="subject">animal behaviour</field><field name="subject">populations size</field><field name="subject">flood impacts</field><field name="subject">sexual segregation</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">site fidelity</field><field name="subject">abundance</field><field name="subject">Animal Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/89</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of bioactive compounds in wheat</field><field name="creator">Winter, Kelly Marie</field><field name="description">Wholegrains have been linked with significant health benefits such as management of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. This study aimed to add value to the grain industry by exploring new nutraceutical targets. This was achieved using bioassay guided fractionation. Wheat extracts including wholegrain, endosperm, pericarp and aleurone from different commercial varieties were investigated for in vitro bioactivity in antioxidant, glycosidic enzyme inhibition, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, immune function and cholesterol lowering assays. This study found wheat to have antioxidant activity as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays with higher values reported for the wheat bran extracts. Amino acid trytophan was identified as the most dominant antioxidant compound in the hard wheat variety durum with a TE value of 24217 &#177; 3158 &#181;mol/g compound. The unsaturated fatty acids oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids proved to be responsible for the majority of the antioxidant activity in the hard wheat bran H2 with TE values of 2424 &#177; 274, 5220 &#177; 523 and 5542 &#177; 102 &#181;mol/g compound, respectively. Wheat bran and germ but not wholegrain or endosperm displayed &#945;-glucosidase and &#945;-amylase inhibiting properties. Through bioassay guided fractionation, phosphoglycerides, 1,2-linoleoylglycero-3-phosphate and 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylglycero-3-phosphate were deemed responsible for the &#945;-glucosidase inhibition. Crude wheat extracts were not cytotoxic to a number of human cancerous cell lines. However, some specific fractions showed selective cytotoxicity to the PC3 human prostate tumour cell line. These fractions contained a number of alkylresorcinols with comparative IC50 values (&#181;g/mL) 5-(2-oxotricosanyl)resorcinol (10.9), trans 5-(14-nonadecenyl)resorcinol (13.7), 5-heptadecylresorcinol (22.5) and trans 5-(16-heneicosyl)resorcinol (42.2) to the known anti-cancer agent Chlorambucil (58.7). In this study, wheat bran extracts have not shown any anti-inflammatory inhibition, estrogen binding inhibition, cholesterol lowering or immune function activity.

The global community must now find ways to reduce greenhouse emissions, particularly from energy generation. Wind energy provides one of the potential solutions to generate renewable energy without creating harmful greenhouse gases. Wind energy is the fastest growing energy generation industry globally (&#8216;Operating wind power capacity' 2006a). This rapid growth is being driven by increasing global energy demand, commitment from governments globally to international agreements including the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC 1997) to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, as well as individual country commitments to mandatory renewable energy targets. Australia, whilst being a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has so far failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In Australia, wind energy development to date has been driven primarily by the development of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. This requires a commitment to 2% of total electricity generation (9,500GW) to be derived from renewable energy sources by the year 2010 (Warwryk, undated). It is now understood, that the current federal obligation to renewable energy is now oversubscribed, and consequently the likelihood of further wind energy projects being developed is highly limited (Brazzale 2005). External to the government commitment to renewable energy, the development of wind energy projects requires a range of inputs including, but not limited to; an understanding of the wind resource, security of land, access to suitable electricity transmission grid, a market for the electricity, access to suitable technology and a level of community support. Whilst the literature related to project management and risk management is extensive, the literature related to the risks associated with wind energy development in Australia is limited. This research then seeks to fill a void that asks the question; How can project managers minimise the risk associated with wind energy developments in Australia? To investigate this research problem, comparative case study analysis was adopted as a methodology utilising a structured interview process of project managers responsible for the development of 8 Australian wind energy projects. This research shows that the greatest risk to Australian projects is the lack of security associated with the current federal legislation and the consequent loss of market value of the power from wind energy projects. A number of additional primary and secondary risks are identified by the interview participants, and the research is able to draw out three common themes of risk management strategies. These three themes were categorised as conservatism, due diligence and proactivism. This study contributes to the research associated with project management, risk management and wind energy development. This insight into the Australian wind energy industry provides policy makers, educators and stakeholders with information to assist in improving the political, economic and social environment for further wind energy development, in order to mitigate against further greenhouse gas emission and combat global warming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">global warming</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources and Conservation</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/23</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision making: being a study to develop a decision-making style to amalgamate best management practice with traditional Thai society and culture</field><field name="creator">Kittisarn, Akkapong</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the development of the decision-making style at Thailand&#8217;s Siam City Cement Public Company Limited (SCCC). The research reviewed the literature, including parent and immediate disciplines. The parent discipline was divided into disciplines 1, 2 and 3. Discipline 1 covered the concept of decision-making and its process. It also assessed types of decisions and summarised the model of decision-making. Discipline 2 looked at organisational structure, decision-making and the locus of decision-making. Finally, discipline 3 focused on group decision-making, group consideration in decision-making and enhancing the group decision-making process. In the immediate discipline, the key elements that influence Thai&#8217;s decision-making styles were discussed. This encompassed Thai societal and cultural characteristics, Hierarchy, organisational characteristics and decision-making. Moreover, research gaps were also explored and the study then proposed four research propositions. The propositions included directing SCCC to develop an appropriate decision-making style based on the group decision-making strategy. The analysis undertaken was qualitative and employed a case study methodology. The data was collected in SCCC&#8217;s Bangkok office between May and September 2002. Data collection was carried out using the Triangulation method. This method employs multiple sources of evidence, including personal interviews, direct and participant observations, documentation and obtaining archival records. The findings confirmed that group decisionmaking should be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of decision-making and efficiency within the firm. Recommendations were also provided for improving practices at the individual, department and organisational level.

Evolutionary psychology (EP) theory informs us that the human mind has certainly evolved and innate mechanisms have been shaped by our ancient social history. Consequently, specifically-evolved mental mechanisms exist that assist the human mind in dealing with complex social phenomena, such as cooperation. Evolutionary psychology theorists posit that for human beings to maximise the benefits of cooperation there need to be efficient ways for individuals to determine whether other members of the social group are operating equitably. Central to successful human cooperation, therefore, we find, amongst others, crucial concepts such as fairness, trust, autonomy, reciprocity, democracy and social recognition.Because the associated mental mechanisms have evolved over millennia they are largely hardwired into the human brain, are relatively slow to evolve, and have not been able to keep pace with the vast and rapid social change brought about through modernity and industrialism. We are left struggling, therefore, with psychological stressors that exist because of the resultant mismatches.This research study considers moral ethics within the workplace as an important component of quality of worklife (QWL), and suggests a new view be taken through the lenses provided by evolutionary psychology theory. This is done specifically with respect to the ethics of a social environment (the business community) that is often quite alienating to our socially evolved minds. This study was conducted with reference to business ethics specifically and it highlights the incongruent landscape lying between that and personal moral ethics. Through the application of social critical theory, it challenges the orthodoxy concerning the relationships between personal liberty, justice and the neo-liberal market economy. It also illuminates the reasons why it is important for business ethics and personal ethics to be brought closer together, and it suggests redefining QWL as a way of bringing about this paradigmatic shift.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of worklife</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">morality</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">evolutionary pyschology</field><field name="subject">social critical theory</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of internship in developing industry-relevant management competencies in tourism and hospitality graduates</field><field name="creator">Walo, Maree Ann</field><field name="description">Industry practitioners and educators both agree that tourism and hospitality management curricula need to reflect recent and future industry needs and developments, to ensure graduates are equipped with appropriate and industry-relevant skills. Furthermore, the combination of theory with practice is viewed as an essential component of a student&#8217;s tourism and hospitality management education. In the past, limited attempts have been made to provide empirical support to claims that a practical internship experience develops management competence in tourism and hospitality management students. In addition, Australian research into the management competencies employers in tourism and hospitality industries expect of recent graduates is minimal. Given the proliferation of tourism and hospitality-related courses over the past decade and the relative importance attributed to internship in developing students&#8217; management competencies, such evaluations are considered important.Thus, this study focused on three main research objectives which were; to identify the management competencies that managers of organisations within tourism and hospitality industries expect of recent tourism and hospitality graduates; to determine whether students&#8217; management competencies are developed during the internship component of Southern Cross University&#8217;s Bachelor of Business in Tourism degree; and to determine whether the management competencies of Southern Cross University&#8217;s Bachelor of Business in Tourism students meet the expectations of selected managers of organisations in four tourism and hospitality sectors. The study utilised the 24 management competencies and eight roles of Quinn, Thompson, Faerman and McGrath&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework (CVF) to test two research hypotheses. The first hypothesis proposed that students&#8217; pre-internship mean scores will be significantly lower than their post-internship mean scores with respect to the 24 management competencies and eight managerial roles associated with Quinn et al.&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework. The second hypothesis proposed that students&#8217; post-internship mean scores will not be significantly lower than the selected managers&#8217; mean scores with respect to the 24 management competencies and eight managerial roles associated with Quinn et al.&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework. A specific survey instrument, the Self Assessment of Managerial Skills (DiPadova, 1990), was used to survey managers within four sectors of Australian tourism and hospitality industries and Bachelor of Business in Tourism internship students from Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. Students were surveyed before and after internship.The study found that students&#8217; perceptions of their level of managerial competence had significantly increased after the completion of their internship placement in six of the 24 management competencies and three of the eight managerial roles, thus partially supporting the first research hypothesis. Further, it was found that pre-internship, students perceived these six competencies were their weakest competency areas, with one exception - Presenting Information by Writing Effectively. This suggests that internship has complemented competencies developed during their coursework. The study also found that after completing internship, students&#8217; perceptions of their managerial competence were reasonably congruent with the expectations of this sample of managers, thus supporting the second research hypothesis. In this study students&#8217; post-internship competencies were found to be reasonably aligned with Quinn, Faerman and Dixit&#8217;s (1987) research which examined the relationship between management competencies and hierarchical levels in an organisation. Empirical data collected from the students and the managers, identified students&#8217; management profiles preand post-internship and the management profile that managers expect of recent graduates.  These profiles resembled Quinn&#8217;s (1991) description of a Master Manager. These findings suggest that internship has assisted students in moving closer to the competence required of a Master Manager.The study concludes that the internship component of a student&#8217;s tourism and hospitality education can hold real educational benefits in preparing them for future management roles. Also, as entry level graduates, this cohort of students has the ability to demonstrate competence over a range of transferable generic management competencies and should be effectively equipped to undertake a range of managerial opportunities that may be presented to them. The study demonstrates the importance of conducting empirically based evaluation to provide support to the debate on the true educational value of internship and highlights the need for further research in this area. It also demonstrates the application of the eight management roles and 24 management competencies of the CVF (Quinn et al., 1990) to tourism and hospitality industries.With the recent proliferation of tourism and hospitality management programs, tertiary education providers are now being held more accountable for the courses they offer. Curricula must reflect the changing needs of industry. Research in collaboration with tourism and hospitality industries must continue to ensure that courses offered are not only relevant but are also producing graduates with skills and knowledge they will need as future managers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management competencies</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative education partnerships: an examination of reciprocal relationships between universities and tourism and hospitality industry organisations in providing professional development education for their employees</field><field name="creator">Breen, Helen</field><field name="description">Cooperative educational partnerships in Australia are considered to be innovative ventures where universities join with industry in a working relationship, sharing resources to develop and provide professional development education for the industry employees. The distinguishing feature of a cooperative education partnership is that all partners contribute to the development, design and delivery of academic courses in the workplace.This research assesses the role and key aspects of professionalism developed by professional development education for industry employees. More specifically, the investigation examined the conditions that contribute to building mutually beneficial, reciprocal cooperative education partnerships between a university and its tourism and hospitality partners.A qualitative approach was adopted to analyse and to understand five cooperative education partnerships situated within the School of Tourism and Hospitality Management Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia. The investigation used the &#8216;Tit-for-Tat&#8217; strategy (Axelrod, 1984; Ridley, 1996; Davies, 1999) based on the old French game of &#8216;Prisoners Dilemma&#8217; (Campbell, 1983; Trivers, 1983) to examine reciprocity.The investigation revealed that providing university-level professional development education through cooperative education partnerships contributed to the development and enhancement of professionalism in the tourism and hospitality organisations involved in the study. Two aspects of professionalism, a renewal of learning, and establishing a positive professional reputation, were found to be important for advancing professionalism in this education arena.A further finding was that when a university, tourism and hospitality businesses and industry associations join together in cooperative education partnerships, they generally respond and adapt to each other in reciprocal ways to ensure the sustainability and success of their partnership. Adjustment, adaptation, responsiveness and synergy were found to be important reciprocal concepts that underpin cooperative dynamics in this investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Snakes in the grass: visual research into myth themes as a means of understanding and interpreting current environmental issues, and as a vehicle for generating art works in response to those issues : an exegesis of the serpent archetype in Mesopotamian/biblical and aboriginal Australian belief systems</field><field name="creator">Rhys, Gillian Lenin</field><field name="description">Snakes in the grass is a visual research endeavour that utilises an arts and science disciplinary interface, to develop a method for generating a series of contemporary allegorical artworks that engage a study of Serpent symbolism and mythology. On the side of Trinity Catholic College beside St. Carthage&#8217;s Cathedral in Lismore stands a life-sized sculpture of the Virgin Mary standing on a Serpent. Inside the school can be found a smaller version of the same sculpture, where priests and students light candles and incense, and place them around the statue. This thesis researches and questions the iconography of the &#8216;cursed Serpent&#8217; as a primary signifier in the European Biblical tradition in Australia, as it stands alongside the iconography of the existing Indigenous cultures of this land, cultures that have a tradition of Serpent veneration. The intention is to identify correlations between differing cultural and social attitudes that are embedded in religious traditions, and different attitudes to the use of natural resources. Material collected through studying the history of Biblical traditions is superimposed, in a form of cultural montage, on to images of technical procedures of research undertaken by scientists researching an innovative water remediation process on Mt Carrington in northern NSW. The scientific research was focused at a disabled gold mine, where acid mine drainage contamination was severe, and represents a small yet significant example of environmental issues being faced all over the world. This research used salt water neutralised bauxite, or red mud, a waste product from aluminium mining to remediate water and soil affected by gold and silver mining. The creative process developed into a contemporary allegorical narrative that operates as a personification and an enactment of a subjective re-reading of issues surrounding Serpent symbolism and the environment. The resulting artworks include paintings, photographs and an earthwork sculpture on the mine site at Mt Carrington. These works are generated to research, focus attention on, and stimulate discussion about cultural and environmental changes and challenges in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/63</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of instruction in two-digit addition and subtraction using a classroom teaching experiment methodology, design research, and multilevel modeling</field><field name="creator">Tabor, Pamela D</field><field name="description">In his keynote address to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics research pre-session, Sloane (2006b) challenged mathematics education researchers to &#8216;quantify qualitative insights&#8217;. This quasi-experimental study used blended methods to investigate the development of two-digit addition and subtraction strategies. Concurrent classroom teaching experiments were conducted in two intact first grade classrooms (n = 41) in a mid-Atlantic American public school. From a pragmatic emergent perspective, design research (Gravemeijer &amp; Cobb, 2006) was used to develop local instructional theory. An amplified theoretical framework for early base-ten strategies is explicated. Multilevel modelling for repeated measures was used to evaluate the differences in strategy usage between classes across occasions and the association of particular pedagogical practices with the emergence of incrementing and decrementing by ten (N10) or decomposition (1010) strategies (Beishuizen, Felix, &amp; Beishuizen, 1990).The two matched classes were not different in terms of gender, poverty, race, pre-assessment performance, and special education services. After the first unit of instruction with differentiated pedagogical tools, the collection class was significantly (p = .001) more likely to use 1010 than the linear class. No difference was demonstrated during the post-assessment. Students in both classes were more likely to use N10 during the last structured interview than in the first (p &lt; .0001). Furthermore, there was no difference between the two classes in using any advanced strategy; however, students in both classes were more likely to use an advanced strategy at the conclusion of the study than they were initially (p = .033). The order of emergence of 1010 and N10 was not associated with the ability to develop both strategies, but there was an association (p &lt; .001) between use of an advanced strategy and success on a district-mandated written assessment of two-digit addition and subtraction.Two original instructional sequences of contextually-based investigations are presented. Protocols transcribed from videotaped lessons and dynamic assessment interviews are presented to illuminate specific constructs detected and to illustrate the pedagogical techniques. An amplified framework for early place value constructs is proposed.

This policy approach also underpinned the reforms to local government in Victoria, Australia that occurred between 1992 and 1999. The Victorian State Government pursued an agenda of reform aimed at reducing costs in local government, reducing the size and scope of local government in delivering public goods and services and also seeking to reduce the perceived high level of influence of trade unions. On the basis of a literature review of the experiences of public sector reform in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, this study sought to test two propositions about public sector reform agendas and trade unions, using the Victorian local government reform as the primary research context. This was an important research gap since trade unions were a major target of the reform agenda and little research information existed as to how the reform agenda impacted on local government trade unions. Although the Victorian State Government did not possess direct legislative power over trade union behaviour, a reform agenda similar to that imposed by the governments in the United Kingdom, could inflict negative outcomes through the consequential changes resulting from competition in the delivery of local council services. The first proposition was that public sector reform agendas underpinned by public choice ideas sought to inculcate competitive practices in the provision of local government services and consequently reduce trade union influence and position in local government. The second proposition was that the level of success achieved by governments on these dual objectives was determined in part by the responses taken by trade unions to the reform agenda and on the extent to which local councils adopted a competitive culture.Five major research questions and a number of sub-questions were developed from the literature to test these two research propositions. In addition, models of effects on trade unions arising from public sector reform and on trade union responses were developed. The models were important for visually showing the areas of impact on trade unions and the level of impact caused by the reform and to identify the options available and responses undertaken by trade unions during this period. An analytical framework was also established and served as a template for organising and recording findings in this study. The analytical framework served to show the main causal links between the reform agenda and outcomes for trade unions. The study adopted features of both positivist and interpretive methodological approaches to address these research questions. A positivist approach was applied in the development of research protocols to ensure researcher independence. In addition, the information collected was matched to the models of union behaviour and to the relevant elements in the analytical framework. The study also adopted features of an interpretive approach in respect of using small samples and in gathering data through interviews with key informants from three case study organisations, one trade union and two local councils.The information collected on the research questions enabled conclusions to be reached on the two research propositions. The findings supported the first proposition and confirmed previous research studies in the United Kingdom that showed how governments are able to target trade unions in indirect ways through the consequences of the promotion of competition in the delivery of local government goods and services. The study identified the negative effects arising for Victorian local government trade unions in areas of access and influence on government policy decision making, membership levels, bargaining outcomes and relations within and between trade unions. The findings gathered in this study also supported the second research proposition. The level of success by the Victorian State Government in achieving local government reform objectives was in part limited by the responses taken by trade unions and also by the extent to which local councils adopted competitive practices. These findings have contributed important insights into local government reform and trade unions, which had not previously been addressed by researchers. The study has also contributed models of union behaviour and an analytical framework for addressing contemporary public policy issues and trade unions. The amalgamation of local councils planned by the Queensland State Government provides a similar research context in which to further test the usefulness of the models of union behaviour and the analytical framework. In addition, the return of the Australian Labor Party to Federal Government, and their aim of dismantling the previous Liberal-National Party&#8217;s WorkChoices industrial relations legislation, provides a context for testing these models and framework under conditions where more direct legislative changes affecting union rights to organise and bargain are pursued.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">Victorian local government</field><field name="subject">trade unions</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/69</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hedonistic pricing models and the valuation of intangible assets</field><field name="creator">Cohen, Michael Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of hedonic pricing models to value intangible assets that are owned by firms.

The shadow prices of these characteristics are estimated and used to derive a market-related value for the intangible assets. The empirical results support using this approach to value intangible assets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intangible assets</field><field name="subject">hedonic pricing models</field><field name="subject">DuPont ratios</field><field name="subject">valuation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/83</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forces shaping the trends and patterns of China&#8217;s outbound international tourist flows</field><field name="creator">Tse, Sze Ming</field><field name="description">This study concerns itself with outbound tourist flows from China. It is informed by the interpretive social sciences paradigm, and the research methodology is qualitative and inductive in nature. The study uses secondary data analysis, case study, interview/questionnaire and participant observation to answer the research question &#8220;How are the trends and patterns of China&#8217;s outbound international tourist flows being shaped?&#8221;Secondary-data analysis is used to understand the historical, socio-economic and political context in which China&#8217;s outbound tourism has developed. Case study is used to identify the similarities and differences in policy and international tourist flow patterns in Japan, Taiwan and Korea, and provide a benchmark for studying China&#8217;s outbound tourism.A total of 13 academics and industry practitioners and 22 senior China National Tourism Administration officials were interviewed either in person or via questionnaire, to examine the roles played by the Chinese government in outbound tourism. Information about China&#8217;s outbound tourism and macro environment was collected from six different forums and seminars.Seven different forces in the macro-environment were found to be at play in China&#8217;s outbound tourism, namely competitive, demographic, economic, technological, cultural, natural and political. The study develops the theory that it is the interplay of these forces that shapes the development of outbound tourism. Among the seven forces, political force, or state control, is the strongest at the moment. The thesis has it that the dialectic interaction between the market economy and state control determines the socio-economic framework shaping the trends and patterns of outbound international tourist flows in China.The Chinese government is not ambiguous about the fact that it has a role to play in outbound tourism. That role is not just related to quality of living, a level playing field or economic development, but also national dignity, diplomacy, and international relations. To the Chinese government, stability is of such paramount importance that the country&#8217;s collective interests are emphasised over the interests of the individual, which are associated with social instability and disorder. Therefore, outbound travel by individuals will be allowed to flourish as long as it continues to serve the wider national interest of the country and it does not undermine national stability.How can these findings be of use to destinations? When approaching China as a potential source market, destinations need to take a more holistic approach in order to understand the underlying drivers of its outbound tourism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasound imaging of finger tendons at the bedside in the emergency department: a pilot study to assess whether it is a feasible and useful investigation</field><field name="creator">Hall, Ann Charlotte</field><field name="description">The interplay of structures in the finger that facilitate movement is complex and not yet fully understood. Subtle finger injuries are often missed during the initial assessment in the Emergency Department, because clinical examination of the acutely injured hand can be difficult. The consequences of unrecognized finger injuries can be devastating for the patient. Ultrasound imaging of tendons is a useful investigative tool although little has been published regarding the reliability of finger tendon measurements. The overall objective of this project was to establish if bedside ultrasound imaging of tendons was possible and useful in the setting of acute injury. The project was divided into two studies.In the first study, 65 apparently normal volunteers were scanned to allow the principal investigator to practise and refine the ultrasound technique. The dimensions of the Extensor Digitorum Longus and two flexor tendons combined (Flexor Digitorum Profundus and Flexor Digitorum Superficialis) were measured in both transverse and longitudinal sections. Fifteen of the volunteers had their left middle fingers scanned twice within 48 hours to establish the test to retest reliability of tendon measurement. The established scanning technique was simple to perform and the scans, including both static and real time images, were completed within five minutes. All volunteers were able to tolerate a full scan. Measurement of tendon width showed fair to good reliability (Intra class correlation [ICC] of flexor tendons = 0.66, ICC of extensor tendon = 0.54). However measurement of the depth of all the tendons was unreliable test to retest (ICC &lt; 0.37).In the second study, 30 patients who presented to the Emergency Department at Lismore Base Hospital with hand injuries were scanned for evidence of tendon injury and tendon gliding restriction. The patient&#8217;s ability to tolerate ultrasound examination was investigated. The scan findings were compared with the clinical findings and then to the operation report or to the patient&#8217;s self reported outcome, one month after injury.Patients were willing to undergo ultrasound examination regardless of the extent of their injury. There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) in scan tolerance related to the site of injury with 50% of those with extensor surface injuries having completed scans in comparison to 36% with flexor surface injuries and 9.1% of finger tip injuries. Injury mechanism was not related to scan tolerance.Excluding a partial tendon laceration was technically difficult due to the presence of anisotropy artefact. However, all complete tendon lacerations were successfully identified prior to surgery. The gliding of the tendons was easy to visualize and abnormal gliding was found to be a marker of tendon injury.The overall results show that ultrasound imaging of finger tendons at the bedside in the Emergency Department is a feasible examination to perform. The addition of ultrasound examination, however, did not identify any cases of tendon injury not already suspected on routine clinical examination.Therefore, this pilot study suggests that routine use of ultrasound examination to detect finger tendon injury in the Emergency Department setting will not prove to be a useful investigation. There may be a role for ultrasound as a screening tool as the gliding of normal tendons differed noticeably from the gliding of injured tendons. The presence of normal tendon gliding may be helpful in identifying those patients that are safe to be discharged from the Emergency Department without further evaluation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrasound</field><field name="subject">finger</field><field name="subject">tendon</field><field name="subject">emergency</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Radiology</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of ageing and exercise training on the ability in control of force and postural stability in relation to hamstrings: quadriceps strength ratio</field><field name="creator">Bezerra, Pedro</field><field name="description">The overall aim of the research was to determine whether the hamstring:quadriceps strength ratio (HQR) played an important role in postural control and effects of different training modes on the HQR and its relationship with the ability to control force and posture in older adults. This thesis reports the outcomes of two related studies. Study One was a cross-sectional study aiming to determine the age-related changes in the knee flexor (KF) and knee extensor (KE) isometric muscle strength ratio and the relationship between the HQR and measured variables in the control of posture in young (YG, 18- 30yrs), middle-aged (MG, 40-50yrs) and older adults (OG, 60-77yrs). Study Two was a training study for older adults aiming to determine the effects of two training programs, home-based-exercise (HBE) and electromyostimulation-superimposed-over-voluntarycontractions (EV), on maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), HQR, muscle steadiness (ST) and postural control.Study One indicated that the MVC of the KF and KE decreased at different rates, 34.7% (~1.4 N.m/year) between MG and OG and 35.6% (~1.5 N.m/year) from YG to OG, respectively, and HQR was significantly higher in MG than OG (p&lt;0.05). MG showed a better control of posture than the OG in anterior-posterior and planar directions. Moderate negative correlations were found between HQR and stabilogram parameters (r=-0.29, p=0.05). The intervention study indicated that MVC of the KE increased in both groups (p&lt;0.01), and that of the KF increased in the EV group (p&lt;0.001), however, the HQR did not change in either group, after six weeks of training. The HBE was effective in improving KE isometric ST and the EV improved KF isometric ST which was a novel finding (p&lt;0.05). The stabilogram parameters changed significantly after training in HBE and EV whilst no differences were found between groups. The traininginduced changes in MVC were not correlated with either ST or postural control. It was iv found that the knee joint stability and the control of force and posture were maintained until the sixth decade of life. The EV training program was effective in improving muscle strength and control of force and posture for older adults. However, the mechanisms responsible for the increased MVC did not appear to be shared by those for the improved control of force.These findings suggest that the HQR may be a valid indicator in assessment of postural control. Further research that focuses on improvement of HQR and its relation to postural control is needed to validate this implication of HQR. No clear trend on the fluctuation of force and muscle contraction intensity relationship was observed. Therefore, to improve the ability in controlling muscle force, more attention should be given to the skill learning rather than maximum strength. No difference was found in the pre to post training changes in controlling upright position between the two types of training examined in this project. Future investigations examining the training effects on postural control should involve unstable stance positions and perturbed balance. Future research should also include the recording of EMG data for analysis of the neural mechanisms responsible for the age-related changes and training effects in control of force and posture, and increased duration of the training program.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Children Activity Scanning Tool (CAST): a methodological study of an instrument to measure physical activity engagement levels of children in school playgrounds and similar environments: a study of the instrument&#8217;s development through four health promotion projects in NSW Australia</field><field name="creator">Zask, Avigdor</field><field name="description">Thesis aim: This thesis aims to analyse and critically evaluate the Children Activity Scanning Tool (CAST), which measures children&#8217;s physical activity (PA) engagement levels in school playgrounds and similar environments, focusing on CAST reliability and validity using data from four health promotion projects in the Northern Rivers (Move it Groove it (MIGI) project), Illawarra, Central Coast and Dubbo areas in NSW, Australia.The overall research question is whether physical activity engagement levels of large numbers of children can be validly and reliably measured in school playgrounds and similar environments using CAST.Methodology: CAST was used to scan school playgrounds and similar environments, in which unstructured rest, play and other physical activities take place. Scanning was undertaken by a team of trained observers who concurrently scanned a pre-defined area of the playground and recorded the number of children engaged in assigned physical activity intensity categories.Criterion validity was measured in three projects comparing the total number of children counted in separate physical activity categories to an independent count of the number of children in the playground using Pearson correlation coefficients. Data obtained during instrument development were used to determine criterion validity in two projects when compared to videotapes using Pearson correlation, Cronbach alphas and 95% CI around mean engagement levels.Data obtained during development and training, as well as project field data were used for reliability testing. Cronbach alpha, Pearson correlation, factor analysis and 95% CI around mean engagement levels were used to measure inter-rater reliability.Data from multi-level regression models obtained in three projects were used to calculate intra class correlation (ICC) and composite reliabilities of scan and break level physical activity engagement.Results: Criterion validity measures comparing sums of categories counts to independent counts of all children yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.97, 0.81 and 0.96 in the Illawarra, Central Coast and Dubbo projects respectively. Criterion validity measures comparing field and video scores yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.47, 0.52 and 0.56 respectively in the Move it Groove it (MIGI) project, and in the Illawarra study Cronbach alphas of 0.98 and 0.85, and a Pearson correlation of 0.93. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of children who were engaged in a physical activity level when 95% CI were used except for one category in the MIGI study.Inter-rater reliability estimates in all projects were high or very high. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of children engaged in a physical activity level when 95% CI were used. Almost 86% (12/14) of the standardised Cronbach alpha estimates were equal to or greater than 0.93. Principal component analysis values ranged from 76%-98%. ICCs obtained from field data yielded composite reliabilities of 0.77-0.94.Conclusion: It was concluded that CAST was a valid and reliable instrument to measure physical activity engagement levels of children in school playgrounds.Recommendations: The two or three categories versions CAST should be used as they produced the highest quality data when used to observe large groups in well-defined playgrounds. Further research is needed to validate other variables (eg equipment), validate a one observer CAST version, and test the feasibility of using children as observers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">school playgrounds</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">validity</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenge, tension and possibility: an exploration into contemporary western herbal medicine in Australia</field><field name="creator">Evans, Sue</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the contemporary challenges facing herbal medicine. Specifically it concerns the difficulties faced by Australian herbalists in their attempts to maintain authority over the knowledge base of their craft and a connection with traditional understandings of the uses of plant medicines, while at the same time engaging with biomedicine and the broader Australian healthcare system. It contributes to the study of the nascent field of qualitative studies in contemporary western herbal medicine by making three main arguments.Firstly, Australian herbal medicine is characterised by its origins as a European colonial practice and its history of professional marginalisation during most of the 20th century. Secondly herbal practitioners have been unable to capitalise significantly on a surge of public popularity in the closing years of the 20th century which brought with it the interest of industry, the scrutiny of regulators and the renewed attention of biomedicine. Herbalists continue to struggle for recognition in the face of these more powerful interests. Thirdly it is argued that herbalists are attempting to gain legitimacy and acceptance as a healthcare profession through a process of underpinning their knowledge base with science, which is replacing their traditional philosophical basis. This has the effect of weakening the ability of herbalists to maintain their identity as an independent profession and makes its knowledge base vulnerable to appropriation by other healthcare professions.Gross&#8217; model of the cultural location of traditions in contemporary societies is used to clarify the situation of herbalists and to identify problems consequent to the political choices they have made or which have been forced upon them. Gross suggests that traditions which place themselves close to power have difficulty in maintaining their own character and integrity, but that other cultural locations are also problematic and limit full participation in society. vi It is argued that there are compelling reasons to move beyond Gross&#8217; analysis and to find ways to strengthen the independence of the herbal profession. Given the financial problems facing the current healthcare system in Australia and the looming ecological challenges, radical changes to the current system are required. The central concepts of herbal practice, in particular vitalism and holism, lead to approaches to healthcare which are potentially both costeffective and ecologically sustainable. A robust and independent profession of western herbalists, with their philosophy articulated and restored, could provide a valuable and sustainable contribution to Australian healthcare.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">herbalists</field><field name="subject">tradition</field><field name="subject">margenalisation</field><field name="subject">professionalisation</field><field name="subject">phytotherapy</field><field name="subject">social epistemology</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small and medium business sponsorship of regional sport tourism events</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Increasingly, communities in regional areas are turning to sports events of a small scale to bring new money into their local economy, provide employment, and provide intangible benefits such as increased community pride. Sports events held on an irregular basis can attract visitors from outside a host community, thus resulting in an increase in business during slow periods and possibly promote the host region as a tourist destination after an event has been staged.In many instances, sponsorship has proven to be the financial lifeblood of sport tourism events held in regional areas, and often provides a majority of the revenue necessary to sustain the successful staging of such events. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) frequently provide the sponsorship necessary to stage such events, owing to the fact that large businesses are sparse in regional areas.The academic community has paid little attention to the sponsorship nexus between SMEs and regional sport tourism events, which this study aimed to address. Grounded in the interpretivist social sciences paradigm, this qualitative study examined five case studies through interviewing five SME owner/managers and five managers of regional sport tourism events. Areas examined included perceptions of sponsorship, reasons why SMEs provided sponsorship to regional sport tourism events, sponsorship leveraging, evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness, and how sponsorships were initiated between SMEs and regional sport tourism events.The results of this research found that the event managers and SME sponsors shared differing perceptions of what constitutes &#8216;sponsorship&#8217;. Volunteer event managers tended to view sponsorship in a somewhat philanthropic manner, while professional event managers were well aware of the importance of reciprocating a return on investment to their sponsors. Sponsorships in this context were initiated either through formal request or networks of personal contacts between SMEs and event organising committees. The sponsorships studied were found to be highly informal in nature and bound by gentlemen&#8217;s agreements, as opposed to legally binding contracts.The primary reasons driving SMEs to sponsor such events were related to supporting their local community and to be seen as socially responsible. Engaging in sponsorship to achieve bottom-line objectives were secondary to community involvement, which confirmed findings from similar studies conducted previously.The results also indicated that sponsorship leveraging and evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness did occur, albeit with varying degrees of success. Both sponsors and event managers tended to exhibit low levels of proficiency in being able to carry out effective sponsorship leveraging and evaluations, and as such leveraging and evaluation techniques employed in these sponsorships tended to be unsophisticated and inexpensive to execute. Only one of the five events studied provided any written post-event feedback to their sponsors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship</field><field name="subject">sport tourism</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">events</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information system success: evaluation of a carbon accounting and sequestration system</field><field name="creator">Smart, William J</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the research conducted for this thesis was to develop a predictive model of information systems success for a publicly-available, web-based application that provides information to users on both the value of carbon credits that result from sequestration of carbon in a forest as well as potential earnings from supply of saleable timber. The application, also developed as part of this research, is called the CO2 Calculator. In addition attitudes of respondents to climate change and carbon sequestration were also gauged to ascertain their knowledge of key environmental issues relevant to the system.The model used as the foundation for the research is the DeLone and McLean (1992, 2002, 2003) model of information systems success. This model was adapted to measure information systems success for the CO2 Calculator which is a publicly available, web-based application rather than a proprietary, task-specific, organizationally focused application as measured in the prior research.Data was collected via a survey dispatched by email to users who accessed the CO2 Calculator. The survey instrument used builds on the existing work of Torkzadeh and Doll (1988, 1999), Seddon and Kiew (1994) and Torkzadeh et al. (2005). All of these researchers used variations of the End User Survey (EUS) to collect data on end users&#8217; perceptions of the success of various applications, all of which were internal, organisationally-focussed, task specific, proprietary systems. This meant the survey items used for the current research were adapted to measure users&#8217; attitudes to a publicly-available, web-based application that had no task-specific roles in an organisation.Analysis of the data proceeded in two distinct phases. The first phase was the examination and presentation of descriptive information about the demographic characteristics of the sample and the users&#8217; attitudes to climate change, carbon sequestration and the overall success of the CO2 Calculator. The descriptive data indicated the respondents are a  technologically literate group who have concerns related to environmental management and the use of land for sustainable practices. It also showed that the users were extremely satisfied with the CO2 Calculator.In the second phase Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to examine the constructs underlying the data and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships among the constructs. Both the EFA and SEM resulted in structures and relationships that differed from the hypothesised outcomes and revealed a set of constructs and relationships that were clearly associated with the success of a publicly-available, web based application with different theoretical associations than those found by previous researchers examining organisationally-focussed, proprietary applications.Regression analyses were also conducted to check the relationships among constructs that were omitted from the final structural model, but were on the hypothesised model. Support for their inclusion in further studies was found as the analysis identified that the scales used to measure these constructs were significant predictors of the outcome variables although not when networked with those constructs that were on the final measurement model.Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, it has resulted in the identification of a predictive model of information success for web-based, publicly available, nonorganisationally focused systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/84</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The care that shines from within: the role of spirituality in aged and palliative care : A qualitative study that explores how spirituality informs care-giving to the elderly and dying in home and residential care in a regional area on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Bloemhard, Anna C</field><field name="description">The importance of spirituality in relation to mental well-being and physical health is currently well regarded in the academic literature. Therefore spiritual care is now considered an important aspect of holistic healing practices. However, research is showing that most health care providers do not feel competent or confident in this area of care. In this thesis I explore how spiritual care is understood and experienced by practitioners in aged and palliative care in a regional area on the coast of New South Wales. The 26 participants, whose insights and experiences are depicted in this thesis, were very happy to be involved in this qualitative research project, because they felt that they now had the opportunity to explore spirituality and spiritual care.The participants in this research describe spiritual care as involving doing in the form of religious practices, such as praying or bible readings and non-religious activities that were seen as spiritual such as talking about dying, touching people or reminiscing. Additionally, they also commented about spiritual care as a special way of being with clients, which involved qualities and attitudes that were clearly felt or recognized by the participants as special. Not necessarily labeled as spiritual care, this special way of being was described as not being separate, but being an integral part of the daily acts of caring such as feeding a patient or preparing them for a bath. Participants found it often difficult to elaborate on what made such an interaction spiritual or how to describe the quality of these interactions as there seemed to be no familiar language to share the experiences of spirituality and spiritual care. Additionally, participants commented quite regularly that, although spiritual care was seen as important, there were many factors that inhibited these practices. In reflecting on these issues I put forward that, although the practitioners in this research are familiar with spiritual care, the most important contribution to encouraging health care providers to feel more confident is to continue conversations about spiritual care to increase competency in a non-denominational spiritual discourse in aged and palliative care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Geriatrics</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of business ethical practices in Australian organisations: a multiple case study</field><field name="creator">Wong, Peter Wai-Hong</field><field name="description">In view of the latest corporate collapses globally, the purpose of this thesis is an attempt to investigate and to theorise how managers make decisions when faced with an ethical dilemma.Philosophers over the years have proposed different moral theories. For example, Kantian&#8217;s Categorical Imperative (O&#8217;Neil 2001, Peters, 1971) suggests that there are laws that should apply universally. However, its principles are too abstract to guide action, in that it does not provide a detailed set of instructions for following them. Others such as Baier, (2001) suggest that people behave to satisfy their own self-interest. The literature review shows that there is no consensus to define what constitutes ethical behaviour. Kohlberg (1981) divides childhood moral development into six stages. He theorises that greater moral development will be related to the highest social responsibility of an individual. Lagon (2000), Seabright and Moberg (1998), Logsdon and Yuthas (1997) extrapolate Kohlberg&#8217;s model to incorporate into organisational and individual moral development.Based on the literature review, research questions were developed. The research methodology is qualitative, based on the realism paradigm using a case research design (Yin 1994). Face to face interviews were conducted with fourteen participants using critical incidents and the findings were triangulated using a semi-structured focus group.The research data analysis is based on grounded theory proposed by Glaser and Strauss (1967). The findings confirm that there is no single theory or approach to business ethics. The findings indicate that a person&#8217;s ethical behaviour changes when his/her self-interest is affected. Whilst participants believed that business and ethics can be reconciled, most agreed that they can only be reconciled if the individual&#8217;s interest or business profit is not affected. Based on the findings, a new model is proposed in an attempt to theorise an   individual&#8217;s business ethical behaviour and his/her ethical decision making process.This research also identifies important areas that require further research. These are:&#8226; Conflicts between personal values and business values&#8226; Should ethics be taught?

The intent is to develop methods to manage this conflict and so enhance the delivery of regional development outcomes. The research problem explored is: &#8216;Government Department core business &#8211; managing the impact of potential conflicts on regional development projects and programs&#8217;The research involves three discipline areas &#8211; Government and governance, public sector management practices, and regional development. Government agency (GA) core business is determined by Government and delivered using public sector management practices that have shaped individual agency&#8217;s strategic plans, processes and systems for core business delivery. Regional development involves multiple agencies delivering their core business outcomes that contribute to regional development. Due to the focus by each agency on their own core business, core business conflict can occur when agencies work together.A literature review did not uncover literature or research about GA core business conflict, therefore this is a new area of investigation. The literature studies and reports investigated and discussed a related area &#8211; issues and impediment to Whole-of- Government (WOG) and &#8216;joined-up&#8217; government initiatives.A qualitative inquiry methodology is used to build knowledge about this new area. The sample of participants is drawn from GAs&#8217; staff who are involved in regional development projects and programs, or projects and programs that contribute to regional development. Data collection is through interviews and surveys with GAs&#8217; representatives from 18 agencies, across three levels of Government and from two distinctly different regions (coastal and inland).Two aspects of core business conflict are investigated &#8211; fundamental core business conflict that involves the underpinning philosophy and ideology of an agency, and functional/operational core business conflicts that include the strategic plans, policies, procedures and systems involved in delivery of core business, which also influence the design of program and project guidelines, and determine funding and staff resourcing.Research findings contribute new knowledge and expand current knowledge regarding challenges and barriers to agencies working together. Findings also enhance the application of approaches and tools to facilitate effective WOG and collaborative agency work.The research has resulted in a &#8216;process&#8217; model to resolve the research problem that applies a holistic and comprehensive operational approach to addressing core business conflict. The &#8216;process&#8217; model builds on the research findings and draws on information and tools from the literature.The research has implications for theory, policy and practice in the three discipline areas involved in the research problem and as a new area investigated, has generated further research opportunities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regional development</field><field name="subject">joined-up government</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">integrated government</field><field name="subject">Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing in the lion's den: women leaders in local government</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Roslyn</field><field name="description">During the twentieth century, women were elected into all spheres of government and political leadership positions in increasing numbers. Still, their numbers are substantially lower than their representation in the population. The same trend is evident in local government in many countries. With few exceptions, there are now more women numerically and proportionately in local government than in state or national governments. Nevertheless, the limited research on women representatives in local government demonstrates that the environment of local government is not necessarily comfortable for women. Many more women than men leave local government voluntarily. If women who are currently practising politics inside local government leave in substantial numbers then little will change. This means that women entering it in the future will face the same environments and challenges (Freeman &amp; Bourque 2001).Against this background, the research study seeks to provide an explanation of how different women experience and perceive positions traditionally held by men, whether there are shared understandings and experiences that transcend the women&#8217;s differences and whether they are changing the environment of local government. To investigate these questions, I employ qualitative feminist research within a framework of feminist political theory, drawing broadly on a range of feminist theory and a variety of political emphases. I interview forty-nine women leaders in local government from England, Sweden, India, the Philippines and Australia, investigating their perspectives and practice thus weighing theory with practice.Several theoretical and practical themes emerge from these findings. The practice revealed by the interviewees is complex, ambiguous and nuanced, consistent with the feminist valuation of relationship, context and the particular. The interviewees bring a different social perspective, reflecting their situated experiences, to their work. This transforms the masculinist environment of the lion&#8217;s den in significant, albeit subtle, ways. The practice of the interviewees shapes agendas and decision-making processes, changes the way representatives of both genders feel about those processes, and molds outcomes for their communities in subtle but distinct ways. In addition, many of the interviewees use their agency actively to change the practices and environment of their councils.I conclude that the practice revealed by these interviewees is best described as a dance in a complex and alien environment, within which women make a palpable difference. This supports arguments for increasing women at the leadership level in both the administrative and political areas of local government, supported by a critical mass of women councillors. More than that, it testifies to the urgency of that task if local government &#8211; the lion&#8217;s den &#8211; is to be more representative of the diverse people it purports to represent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">difference</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">Political Science</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/97</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comfort in adventure: the role of comfort, constraints and negotiation in recreational SCUBA diving</field><field name="creator">Dimmock, Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the role of comfort in adventure leisure and in recreational SCUBA diving in particular. In this chapter the study&#8217;s central elements of comfort, constraints and negotiation will be introduced. Human engagement with marine locations provides background to the evolution of SCUBA diving as a leisure activity. The concept of comfort is then introduced, with attention given to what comfort means from a range of disciplines. Following this, the use of the term comfort in adventure, leisure and tourism research is reviewed. Divers&#8217; constraints to comfort are also briefly examined here in this introduction, to build understanding of how comfort can be experienced during adventure, and SCUBA diving. Leisure constraints-negotiation research is discussed briefly and linked to SCUBA diving experiences. The objectives of this study are then presented prior to introducing the qualitative research paradigm that guides the research, and the thesis outline.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SCUBA diving</field><field name="subject">constraints</field><field name="subject">leisure negotiation</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">dive tourism</field><field name="subject">leisure experiences</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/96</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independent bicycle tourism in Australia: a whole tourism systems analysis</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Evidence exists to suggest increasing political interest in cycling-related tourism, particularly as a contributor to economic and social development in rural communities. The former Australian Government&#8217;s long-term strategy document for tourism, the Tourism White Paper, has also identified cycling-related tourism as a potential contributor to strengthening competitive advantage for Australia with respect to tourism. However, little theory-driven research exists hitherto to guide decision-making regarding prudent provision of infrastructure and services to facilitate the development of cycling-related tourism, while little research exists that aids in our understanding of the travel behaviours and characteristics of bicycle tourists.The present study examined independent bicycle tourists in Australia using a generic model of whole tourism systems as a framework for analysis. The study employed a mixture of quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore the needs, preferences and behaviours of independent bicycle tourists. In addition, several conditions previously identified in applied literature as possible impediments to the development of independent bicycle tourism in Australia were examined.The results indicated that independent bicycle tourists&#8217; behaviours and thought processes regarding destination selection reflected those put forward in the broader literature addressing special interest tourism, in that the activity to be pursued is more prevalent in driving decision-making than the actual destination(s) to be visited. This was illustrated by the importance attached by the respondents to aspects that directly relate to a destination area&#8217;s capacity to support cycling, particularly the presence and quality of cycling infrastructure (specifically roads, paths, trails and signage), endowed resources (appealing natural scenery), supporting industries, and accessibility.Three conditions were confirmed as impediments to the development of independent bicycle tourism in Australia. These impediments included perceptions of cycling on Australian roads as a dangerous practice; perceptions that infrastructure to support independent bicycle touring in Australia is generally inadequate; and perceived difficulties associated with the carriage of bicycles on air, coach and rail services in Australia. This research also identified several limitations regarding the capacity of Leiper&#8217;s model of whole tourism systems to articulate tourist flows associated with independent bicycle tourism. These limitations specifically related to the way the tourist destination regions and transit routes elements are conceptually defined in the generic model. An adapted descriptive, theoretical model of whole tourism systems involving independent bicycle tourism was proposed. The adapted model incorporated a geographic &#8216;hierarchy of destinations&#8217; sub-system and also acknowledged two distinct forms of transit routes: those traversed between the traveller-generating region and the destination area; and those traversed within the destination area by bicycle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bicycle tourism</field><field name="subject">cycle tourism</field><field name="subject">whole tourism systems</field><field name="subject">cycling</field><field name="subject">special interest tourism</field><field name="subject">adventure tourism</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/95</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of participants at special interest events in regional Australia</field><field name="creator">Mackellar, Joanne</field><field name="description">Events provide opportunities for communities to socialise, interact and to enjoy a sense of mutual celebration. However, special interest events offer other opportunities for recreation, and for the development of skills, identities and knowledge. Events such as car shows, Sci-fi conventions and Elvis festivals have large numbers of participants, as well as spectators, who have specialised needs and characteristics. This thesis uses a series of five published studies to examine the participants at special interest events and further to understand their characteristics and behaviours. The studies employ a mixed method approach to explore participants at a total of eleven events in Australia. In the first of these studies a spectrum of events is developed to explain the diversity of events in a region, as related to the special interest of participants. The study used a mixed method methodology to examine the differences between audiences at nine events in the Tweed Valley of NSW. The results were used to focus the study more on events that target serious participants.The second study was published as a conceptual paper, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of serious participants of leisure, recreation and events. The paper posits a model of serious participants (SerPa) for use and refinement in subsequent studies. Papers 3 and 4 explore serious participants at two feature events in Australia, the Wintersun Festival in Coolangatta, and the Elvis Revival Festival in Parkes. Drawing on the serious leisure framework proposed by Stebbins (2001), and other leisure and tourism research, the study explored the characteristics and behaviours of serious participants at these events. Ethnographic methods were used to gain insight into behaviours, through participant observation at the events. The findings further develop the SerPa model, but also identify other themes that are relevant to leisure and event management and marketing. Paper 5 explores the social connections of serious participants made on the Internet, and identifies their relationship to travel planning and events. The study utilised ethnographic methods adapted to the Internet, to identify and discuss the social characteristics of serious participants as fans of Lord of the Rings, and the processes used to collaborate toward travel planning.The study demonstrates the significance of serious participants as a segment of audiences at events, highlighting their contributions to the events themselves. As participants, they make the event happen, and are perhaps more important than consumers (Getz, 2007). They are defined by what they do in their leisure time, more than who they were born as, or by their profession. They have a leisure identity that defines them, and can find support and security in the fanatical system that they subscribe to. This system is usually found in special interest clubs, on-line networks and at events. These social systems help sustain their beliefs, and provide a leisure world where they feel a sense of &#8216;we&#8217;. From their serious devotion and social connectivity, serious participants receive social and personal rewards, which in turn provide more stimuli to develop their skills and/or knowledge. These psycho/social characteristics result in participants searching for new challenges and new destinations, which can facilitate their needs. These are found at events that are designed specifically with serious participants in mind. The study demonstrates that identification of these market segments has important implications for the design and sustainability of events in Australia, and overseas. Additionally, it also has implications for planners and practitioners in leisure and tourism in understanding the extant links between recreation, travel and events.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">event</field><field name="subject">participant</field><field name="subject">special interest</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">festival</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/94</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of the gene responsible for fragrance in rice and characterisation of the enzyme transcribed from this gene and its homologs</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Louis MT</field><field name="description">The flavour or fragrance of Basmati rice is associated with the presence of 2-acetyl-1- pyrroline. This work shows that a gene with homology to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BAD) has significant polymorphisms in the coding region of fragrant genotypes relative to non fragrant genotypes. Accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in fragrant rice genotypes may be explained by the presence of mutations resulting in loss of function of the fgr gene product. The fgr gene corresponds to the gene encoding BAD2 in rice while BAD1 is encoded by a gene on chromosome 4. Development of an allele specific amplification (ASA) based around the deletion in the gene encoding BAD2 allows, perfect, simple and low cost discrimination between fragrant and non-fragrant rice varieties and identifies homozygous fragrant, homozygous non-fragrant and heterozygous non-fragrant individuals in a population segregating for fragrance. The cDNAs transcribed from rice chromosomes 4 and 8, each encoding an enzyme with homology to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase were cloned and expressed in E. coli. The enzyme responsible for fragrance, encoded from chromosome 8, had optimum activity at pH 10, showed low affinity towards betaine aldehyde (bet-ald) with Km value of approximately 63&#236;M but a higher affinity towards -aminobutyraldehyde (GABald) with a Km value of approximately 9&#236;M. The enzyme encoded from chromosome 4 had optimum activity at pH 9.5 and showed generally lower affinity towards most substrates compared to the enzyme encoded from chromosome 8, substrate specificities suggest that the enzymes have higher specificity to aminoaldehydes and as such both should be renamed as an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase (AAD). The inactivation of AAD2 (BAD2) in fragrant rice varieties likely leads to accumulation of its main substrate GABald which then cyclises to 1-pyrroline the immediate precursor of 2AP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2-acetyl-1- pyrroline</field><field name="subject">jasmine rice</field><field name="subject">basmati</field><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">fragrance</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">amino aldehyde dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/91</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional festivals: nourishing community resilience: the nature and role of cultural festivals in Northern Rivers NSW communities</field><field name="creator">Derrett, Ros</field><field name="description">This thesis examines four regional community cultural festivals in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. It reveals the complex interplay of a sense of place and community, a destination&#8217;s identity and representation, host guest relationships and the underlying nature and role of celebration expressed in each festival. It examines the regional context in which the Jacaranda Festival in Grafton, the Beef Week celebrations in Casino, the New Year&#8217;s Eve celebrations in Byron Bay and the Mardi Grass Law reform rally in Nimbin are conducted. An extensive literature review provides a global perspective on theories, issues and trends in the sectors reflected in the case study festivals. The phenomenological approach to the case study methodology is explained before each festival is closely scrutinized, addressing the study&#8217;s aim.The thesis aims at a better understanding of the elements of resilience fostered by festivals when communities take intentional action. This resilience dimension emerged as a major outcome of the initial investigation of the nature and role of festivals in regional communities.The thesis argues that festivals allow people to reflect and determine a sense of community and place, represent their image and identity and contribute to cultural tourism. Community festivals involve the local population in a shared experience to their mutual benefit by providing both social functions and symbolic meanings. This study contends that community-based festivals celebrate the community&#8217;s social identity, its historical continuity and its cultural resilience. They are socially constructed and negotiated phenomena and can be staged in everyday places that also become tourist places. Festivals provide a forum for creativity, custom, heritage and cultural practices for both resident and guest.Investigating community cultural festivals from multiple perspectives allows for greater understanding of the nuances of the relationships between stakeholders. By identifying the patterns, structures and meanings of the contexts that festivals represent we are better informed of the distinctive values, interests and aspirations held by residents when they host festivals. Perspectives on community festivals and resilience were canvassed from diverse perspectives as demonstrated by the following typical responses:Nourishing resilience through Festivals and CommunitiesThere are many intangible reasons why a community chooses to host a festival such as socio-cultural, economic, political and environmental and each reason is not mutually exclusive (Backman et al, 1995).The Northern Rivers region stands apart from the rest of rural Australia as living as if the future matters. This is a very powerful attractor in these times of urban decay and environmental despair (Dunstan, 1994:2).Sense of place, can be described as, the common ground where interpretation and community development meets in a concern to create or enhance a sense of place, to establish what is significant and valued in the environment or heritage of a particular community, and to provide action for its wider appreciation and conservation (Binks, 1989:191 cited Trotter, 1998).Democratic communities take responsibility for their future. It is undeniable that cohesive community events based on ideals create a sense of community. The excitement and joy that people feel when they work together for their community and future means that they will attempt to recreate that experience. It becomes their preferred way (Emery, 1995:70).&#8230;the notion of community is always something of a myth. A community implies a coherent entity with a clear identity and a commonality of purpose. The reality is that communities, more often than not, are made up of an agglomeration of factions and interest groups often locked in competitive relationships (Smit, 1995 cited in Joppe, 1996:475).Community, the custodians of the content of Australian tourism, must be enabled to participate in tourism by forming its content. Only if Australians are involved in tourism will it survive, (Wood, 1993:7).Through direct contact and interaction with each festival, the qualitative exploratory study reveals how in formal and informal ways participants at the four case study sites demonstrate the diverse and fragmented nature of festivals. Although none of these festivals is identical, some consistent patterns do emerge to demonstrate that comparisons can be developed. These patterns have their own advantages and disadvantages and it is evident that success or failure is not linked to a particular model for such festivals. Each community has an ongoing challenge of determining how their festival can best meet its needs presently and into the future. Each is trying to keep pace with the changes that are taking place within their communities, within the region and from external forces. This is where the study also generates new knowledge: tracking the changes occurring in community festivals in contemporary regional Australia.Through a systematic analysis of data the study significantly contributes to our understanding of the character of community festivals. Through surveys, interviews, media analysis, photographic images and critical observation, it clearly observes that social, economic and environmental issues currently presented in the literature require greater deconstruction and critical engagement. Rich and quilted description of the festivals informs this research providing grounded scholarly investigation. This approach leads to a greater understanding of significant social and cultural agendas in regional communities. Festivals add value to communities. They creatively produce and embed culture. They can be viewed as celebrations of resilience.Through a systematic analysis of data the study significantly contributes to our understanding of the character of community festivals.

Each participant contributes to the program, traditions, cultural practices, impact and reach of events with differing voices and emphases.In principle, festivals and their host communities offer individual members a framework for attending to general aspects of life. This study reaffirms that community festivals particularly hold a significant position in three areas of the human condition. They celebrate a sense of place through organising inclusive activities in specific safe environments. They provide a vehicle for communities to host visitors and share such activities as representations of communally agreed values, interests and aspirations. Finally, they are the outward manifestation of the identity of the community and provide a distinctive identifier of place and people.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">festivals</field><field name="subject">resiliance</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">cultural tourism</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">partnerships</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">celebrations</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and testing a model of cooperative interorganisational relationships (IORs) in product innovation in an Australian manufacturing context: a multi-stakeholder perspective</field><field name="creator">von der Heidt, Tania</field><field name="description">As fast-growth economies, such as China and India are dominating export markets, innovation in the manufacturing industries of slower, developed  economies, such as Australia is a survival issue. Particularly small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) with limited internal innovation resources and capabilities are suffering. Corresponding with this development, academic interest in analysing the relationship between innovative performance of small firms and their recourse to external resources, especially through interorganisational relationships (IORs) has been growing over the last ten to fifteen years. To date the emerging literature has given limited attention to the systematic empirical assessment of the relationship and innovation inputs and outputs of cooperative product innovation. Furthermore, most of the literature focuses on cooperative innovation IORs with customer stakeholders, ignoring the potential role played by other external stakeholder groups, such as suppliers, industry partners and research/advisory organisations. To this end, this thesis investigated the following research question: What are the relationships between IOR- and innovation-oriented antecedents and consequences of cooperative product innovation and how effective for overall firm performance is product innovation cooperation with multiple stakeholders? A six-factor multi-stakeholder model of cooperative IORs in product innovation for Australian manufacturers was developed from a strategy-structure-performance-based model of marketing channel relationship structure. It synthesised and built upon prior models of cooperative product innovation and incorporated concepts and measures drawn from the IOR and product innovation literatures. The central, structure-based construct (measurement model) developed was stakeholder involvement in product innovation (SIPI). Two factors were used to predict SIPI: Stakeholder orientation (SO) and Product innovation orientation (PIO). A further two factors represented outcomes of SIPI: Relationship quality (RQ) and Product innovation performance (PIP). A sixth factor - Overall firm performance (OFP) - was also measured to assess the broader implications of the model. Two objective, single-item variables were also included in the model &#8211; relative Product innovation spending (associated with PIO) and Sales growth (associated with OFP).To address the multi-stakeholder perspective, four external stakeholder groups most likely to be involved in a manufacturer&#8217;s product innovation (customers, suppliers, industry partners (competitors) and research/advisory organisations) were assessed. Eight hypotheses positing associations between the six constructs were developed. As strategic data was required, the research method for primary data collection was a survey of CEOs/General Managers of Australian machinery and equipment manufacturers, predominately SMMEs. A questionnaire was designed to measure their opinions about the firm&#8217;s relationships with each of the four stakeholder groups in product innovation as well as their views on the firm&#8217;s product innovation orientation and performance. Following extensive pre-testing of the questionnaire, it was distributed by mail and online to the senior managers. Data obtained from 120 respondents was used in the research.Using a two-step structural equation modelling (SEM): confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach, examinations of parameter estimates, fit and residuals were used to test the individual constructs for validity. Composite reliability and average variance extracted were used to test for construct reliability. An overall (multi-stakeholder) structural model, as well as four single-stakeholder models, of key relationship- and innovation-oriented antecedents and consequences of cooperative product innovation were then tested using SEM AMOS software. Meaningful modifications of the hypothesised model were undertaken to improve model fit. The four modified single-stakeholder models and the overall (multistakeholder) model were found to provide a satisfactory fit. Statistically significant standard coefficients for each of the latent constructs provided evidence of the importance of each element as an input or outcome of cooperative innovation. The results indicated that, as posited, a firm&#8217;s Product innovation orientation (PIO) was positively associated with its Stakeholder orientation (SO). SO, in turn, was a valid antecedent of cooperative product innovation (SIPI). The hypothesised direct path from SIPI to RQ was, however, not supported. Instead, SIPI was found to partially mediate the SO-RQ association, further strengthening that positive link. Surprisingly, PIO did not appear to significantly influence cooperative innovation SIPI. Instead, PIO was found to be a strong and direct antecedent of market- and technical-oriented PIP, whereby the cooperative innovation construct SIPI did not materially impact Product innovation performance PIP. Product innovation spending directly influenced technical-oriented PIP only. RQ was a valid predictor of Sales growth, but not of Overall firm performance OFP. While market-oriented PIP was found to lead to stronger assessments of OFP, increased technical-oriented PIP negatively impacted on OFP. Consequently, seven of the eight hypotheses relating to the research model were accepted in part or full, and one hypothesis was rejected.Overall, qualified support was found for the central proposition: Higher (sales) growth manufacturers tend to pay more attention to their relationships with the top firms in each of four stakeholders groups (customers, suppliers, industry partners and advisory/research firms), involve these firms more in product innovation activities and perceive their relationships to be of higher &#8216;quality&#8217;. Firms with sound overall firm performance (return on investment, net profit, market share and overall business performance) tend to be more product innovation focused (in terms of strategy and spending) and achieve product innovations, which are successful both technologically and market-wise. However, stakeholder involvement in product innovation is not as good a predictor of product innovation outcomes as is the firm&#8217;s product innovation orientation (strategy).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/70</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The play(fulness) of law</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Nicole</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I undertake an investigation into the relationship between play, playfulness and law. Law relies on a certain form of play, rule-bound orderly play; this is demonstrated, for example, in the ceremony of the trial. Furthermore, underpinning every legal system, we find a different form of play: the spontaneous and disruptive performances of revolutionary violence which found every state. Play can be, in fact, an unpredictable force. Play can disrupt or derail the structured performances of law; play can deflect the violence of the state. I am interested in the dramatic possibilities of using subversive play, or playfulness, as a strategy for negotiating violence. This is, in many respects, a postmodernist work. I draw upon and use self-reflective narrative, conduct my investigation by way of case studies, seek to expose the relationships of power behind both text and performance, and deconstruct accepted understandings of terms like law and play. It is also an interdisciplinary work, in which I draw upon the &#8216;interdiscipline&#8217; of performance studies. In integrating performance studies theory with law, and in considering law as yet another cultural performance, I have disregarded the artificial boundaries which positivist legal scholars seek to construct between law and (non)law. Positivists view law as a set of norms and rules; in law, the written text is sacrosanct. I have adopted the approach of performance studies theorists, who view all social and cultural activities as performance and regard culture as a verb rather than as a noun. Law might endure as text, but it is made as performance. My first set of case studies originate in the contemporary war on terror. Terrorism can itself be viewed as a performative phenomenon and form of (dark) play; it is also, clearly, about violence. I undertake a comparative critique of two different performative responses to the war on terror: namely, the terror trials and the theatre of dissent. I consider the interplay between the violence of terrorism and the violence of law in the terror trials. I also look at the extent to which the theatre of dissent &#8216;plays&#8217; with different forms of violence in order to disrupt the authority of the state. The different functions and roles of these two forms of cultural performance become apparent in their engagement with violence and with the state, their portrayal of difference, their exposure to mediatisation, and their relationship with the &#8216;truth&#8217;.There is little playfulness in the play of the terror trials, or in the play of the theatre of dissent. I turn, therefore, to playfulness in law. I consider eruptions of playfulness in the courtroom. I also look at the transformation of law into play through the phenomenon of documentary theatre. I am intrigued by the subversive and playful possibilities in providing the text of law with a different performative force, and in uncoupling law from violence through re-performance as theatre. My final set of case studies originate in the playful performances of environmental protest. We find different forms of play characterising and underpinning the rationale for such performances. Play in its pre-rational guise is embraced as a strategy to capture the media&#8217;s attention and confound violence against nature. Play, in its ideological association with wilderness, appears in a more solemn guise. Using case studies drawn from the war on the environment, I investigate the relative efficacy and symbolic value of different forms of play, the pre-rational play of direct action and the rational play of legal performances, in countering violence against nature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">playfulness</field><field name="subject">play</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">trials</field><field name="subject">protest</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Unsaid&#8217; voices of middle-level women nurses&#8217; experience of Western Australian public hospitals: an integrated feminist postmodern ethnography</field><field name="creator">Pannowitz, Helen K</field><field name="description">The context for this research was the socio-political, culturally constructed, lived experience of eight women nurses who held middle-level positions in two Western Australian public hospitals. Glass and Davis&#8217; (1998) integrated feminist postmodern model for nursing research framed the design for the ethnographic investigation.The researcher used an innovative self-developed trifocality method: realist; critical feminist; and feminist postmodern to critique ethnographic data against the research aim and objectives and reflexively engaged with the women nurses to reveal unacknowledged individual and collective insights. Participant observation, critical conversation, and reflective field/journaling were used as triangulated data collection methods. The methodology revealed the local, particular, historical, taken-for-granted and traditionally gender-biased subjugated voices of individual women nurses as legitimate sites for the production of knowledge and insights.The trifocal data analysis revealed multiple intersecting layers of meanings and insights. The participants unacknowledged &#8216;unsaid&#8217; experiences were viewed as exemplar &#8216;states of being&#8217;, or subjectivity positions, of their multiple and temporal realities. Inherent within the subjectivity positions was their personal, professional and corporate efforts, assumed as self-managing strategies and implicit knowledge, to enact work roles.Deeper critique, applying feminist poststructuralism (Lather 1991b) and postmodern notions of power/knowledge networks of relationships (Foucault 1980b) revealed three competing socio-political culturally constructed discourses. Firstly, the participants&#8217; were embedded within an empowering &#8216;Discourse of Values Attributed to Nursing/Between a Rock and a Hard Place&#8217;. Secondly, they were influenced by, and resistant to the patriarchally dominant &#8216;Discourse of Bureaucratic Managerialism Discourse/Absence of Care&#8217;.  thirdly, they functioned within the influence of the disempowering &#8216;Discourse Medical Science/Working the Margins&#8217;.This research contributes to the knowledge base of scholarly work that exists about nurses, women nurses specifically, concerning the meaning of the experiences of practicing in the confluence of corporate and professional responsibilities. At the personal participant level the insights contribute to emancipatory consciousness-raising. The insights also positively contribute to the recommendations made in The Report of the Western Australian Study of Nursing and Midwifery (Pinch &amp; Della 2001). The insights may evoke wider awareness of the disempowering influence of managerialism upon professional practice and inter-professional relationships. Finally, the unique trifocal data analysis method contributes to the body of nursing and social science research knowledge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">post moderism</field><field name="subject">ethnograohy</field><field name="subject">corporate management</field><field name="subject">public hospital</field><field name="subject">emancipatory qualitative methodology</field><field name="subject">professional clinical specialist</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate entrepreneurship and government business enterprises: the pre-paradigmatic dance of the chameleon</field><field name="creator">Sadler, Robert John</field><field name="description">The existing research into corporate entrepreneurship is based upon experiences in the private sector. Reforms of public sectors throughout the western world are focussing on entrepreneurial practices as part of a program to align public sector management practices with those of the private sector.This research concentrates on corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector and specifically addresses opportunities for the emergence of corporate entrepreneurship in Government Business Enterprises (&#8220;GBEs&#8221;).The literature assumes that entrepreneurial practices in the private sector may be foisted upon the public sector. The paper proposes that corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector is the result of different influencing factors and involves different processes from its private sector counterpart.Building on private sector research this research examines those factors that stimulate and constrain corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector. It addresses the extent to which the influences of factors that stimulate corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector are replicated in GBEs. This analysis generates a model that is founded on:1. Three research propositions that concern the correlation between those factors that foster corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector and those applicable to GBEs. They also address the preponderance of those facilitating factors in corporatised and non-corporatised GBEs; and2. An investigation into the manner in which the facilitating factors influence opportunities for the emergence of corporate entrepreneurship and the extent of that potential emergence. The presence or absence of factors that stimulate or constrain corporate entrepreneurship, however, does not explain its occurrence or absence. Public sector organisations which ensure that the influence of those factors that facilitate corporate entrepreneurship outweigh the influence of the inhibiting factors are more likely to be ready and able to react to opportunities to create value by adopting entrepreneurial processes. This is the basis of a Model that is developed and refined during the course of the paper.The Research Propositions were tested by a survey of 322 publicly urban water businesses located throughout Australia. The Model was illuminated and enhanced by considering case studies from twelve urban water businesses. The literature demonstrates that reforms to the public sector since the late 1970&#8217;s have created opportunities for corporate entrepreneurship. The literature also reveals that entrepreneurship is a strategic phenomenon. This paper demonstrates that the environment within which corporate entrepreneurship may occur is influenced by the organisation&#8217;s existence within either the public or the private sector and, within the public sector, the environmental and operating features of the entity as either a corporatised GBE, a non-corporatised GBE or other structure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">public sector management</field><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">corporate entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">government business enterprise</field><field name="subject">corporatisation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/38</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disappearing dividends: the case of Thai listed firms</field><field name="creator">Ronapat, Malinee</field><field name="description">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is an important source of funds for firms and provides opportunities for investors. However, the economic boom of 1990-1996, the Asian Economic Crisis and the recession of 1997-2002 have affected the performance of firms listed at SET. The dividend policies of listed firms have also been influenced by these fluctuations in the business cycle.This study investigates the phenomenon of disappearing dividends in the developing capital market of Thailand. It adopts a similar methodology to Fama and French (2001) by classifying listed firms in line with changes in their dividend polices over the period 1990 to 2002. More specifically, the study explores the characteristics of firms which pay dividends, non-payers, former payers and firms which have never paid dividends. These characteristics include profitability, investment opportunities and firm size. The analysis uses firm characteristics for predicting the dividend policies of listed firms. Changes in firm characteristics and the propensity to pay dividends are identified in this process.The analysis suggests that firms which pay dividends tend to be large and highly profitable, although they possess low investment opportunities. The study also suggests that the characteristics of firms which paid dividends changed slightly before the crisis of 1997 and changed markedly during the crisis. However, after the crisis (1998-2002) the characteristics of firms are similar to those observed before the crisis. This result is attributed to the fact that some firms have resumed paying dividends after briefly ceasing this payment during the crisis. More importantly, when firm characteristics are held constant, the propensity to pay dividends of listed firms declined slightly before the crisis and declined strongly after the crisis. Consequently, the majority of new firms and many mature firms do not pay dividends.The findings of this study are consistent with the results of Fama and French (2001), particularly with regard to the characteristics of firms and changes in the propensity to pay dividends. However, this study extends the knowledge on the phenomenon of disappearing dividends by focussing on a developing economy, Thailand. Finally, this study suggests that investors should consider the characteristics of firms, changes in these characteristics and the propensity to pay dividends when identifying opportunities for investment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dividends</field><field name="subject">capital market</field><field name="subject">investment</field><field name="subject">disappearing dividends</field><field name="subject">equity/stock market</field><field name="subject">emerging markets</field><field name="subject">propensity</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">stock exchange of Thailand</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading innovation and entrepreneurship: an action research study in the Australian red meat industry</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Christine Anne</field><field name="description">The dynamic and often hostile competitive landscape of the twenty-first century has created significant threats to existing patterns of successful competition. A review of the extant literature and research about innovation and entrepreneurship identifies their importance to ensuring corporate vitality and wealth generation in today&#8217;s global economy. For over one hundred andfifty years the foundation of Australia&#8217;s prosperity has been from resource based industries such as agriculture and mining. Changes in the world economy clearly require a much broader range of globally competitive industries to sustain Australia&#8217;s strong economic position. It is proposed that the older more traditional industries must also undergo rapid transformation if they are to maintain their competitive advantage. This thesis describes an action research study conducted over four years (2002-2006) in the Australian red meat industry. The study aimed to extend the body of knowledge on innovation and entrepreneurship in the industry. It also sought to explore options for improving practice through interventions which would accelerate the development of firm innovation capabilities and a culture of innovation more broadly across the industry.The thesis articulates a comprehensive contextual framework of the sector&#8217;s innovation and entrepreneurship system and an associated model of firm innovation and entrepreneurial capability. In addition, a new methodology for mapping the effectiveness of an innovation system is developed based on the emerging concept of system failures. By applying this methodology, a new SI-Intervention Framework is developed and a suite of intervention projects is tested for acceptance and potential impact with industry participants.It is proposed that the thesis offers a contribution to knowledge through convergence of the related fields of innovation and entrepreneurship into a single conceptual framework. In addition, the development of new theoretical and analytical models and methodologies build on and extend the work of previous researchers. Evidence of improved practice is demonstrated in relation to incorporation of the new framework and methodologies into the industry&#8217;s future innovation strategy, building internal capability in the innovation intervention agency, and acceptance by industry participants of the new approach.It is acknowledged that the models and concepts articulated in this thesis are at an early stage of development and that there is a significant amount of further research required. Similarly, as the study is focused on a single case, no attempt is made to offer broad generalisations. The value of the study will ultimately be determined by the specifics of future research contexts and can only be evaluated to the extent that it seems accurate, appropriate and authentic from the reader&#8217;s own perspective.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">innovations systems</field><field name="subject">innovation system failures</field><field name="subject">firm innovation</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">food industry</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/36</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hedge funds and China&#8217;s stock market: a study on factors influencing investment decisions by fund managers</field><field name="creator">Phan, Alan</field><field name="description">Hedge funds and China&#8217;s stock market: a study on factors influencing investment decisions by fund managersThe research was conducted using a web-based questionnaire sent to all Asia-related hedge funds, worldwide. Analysis of the collected data revealed that the factors influencing the portfolio investments made in China by fund managers differed from the factors which influence investment in global and emerging markets. While market conditions, market timing and changes in earning estimates are the top three influencing factors on investment decisions on global stock exchanges, fund managers are more influenced by global trend, potential growth and company size when dealing with China&#8217;s stock market. Research results also support the hypotheses that there are relationships between size of fund, trading style and personal expertise of managers and the factors influencing investment decisions.The international hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market are two fast-growing entities of global capital markets. Stronger interaction between these two institutions in the future would create important implications for the financial world. The objective of this research is to identify factors that influence investment decisions by hedge fund managers in relation to China&#8217;s stock market.The following implications can be extracted from this research:(1) If China&#8217;s stock market is classified within the Emerging Markets Index, adjustments are necessary and provision should be made reflecting investor criteria for China.(2) Global trends and the potential growth of China were the two most attractive factors influencing investment decisions, suggesting a &#8216;herding&#8217; tendency and &#8216;attention-grabbing&#8217; bias of hedge fund managers.(3) Company evaluation remains important to hedge fund managers, suggesting that Chinese government regulators should implement reforms to improve quality of listed firms.(4) Gaps in the research on China&#8217;s stock market as well as the outcomes of this research indicate that further studies on the international hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market could reveal new perspectives and enhancements to the current body of knowledge on these subjects. This thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the research context and research justification. The research problem and questions are identified, and the theoretical framework and hypotheses are constructed. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market. Chapter 3 examines the literature: factors that influence investment decisions in global, emerging markets and in particular, China&#8217;s stock market. A framework of an 8-step decision-making process was developed. Chapter 4 researches alternative methodologies and presents a justification for the selection of the research methodology. Chapter 5 summarises the results of the data analysis and interpretation. Chapter 6 discusses the conclusions, implications, contributions and limitations of the research. Recommendations for further research are also included.The outcomes of this research are expected to benefit all participants of the global financial industry, including institutional and individual investors; executives in banking, insurance and securities businesses; financiers of listed firms and multinational corporations; government regulators and independent research analysts. Other beneficiaries will be academics and the media.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hedge funds</field><field name="subject">China&#8217;s stock market</field><field name="subject">portfolio investment</field><field name="subject">decision making process</field><field name="subject">influencing factors</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">capital markets</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial management and profitability of small and medium enterprises</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Kieu Minh</field><field name="description">After a decade of reforming policy, building and developing the multi-sector market economy, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam have developed strongly and contributed to creating employment, increasing GDP, and raising the nation&#8217;s volume of exports. However, SMEs have found difficulties on the way to development due to lack of management experience and financial resources, and due to uncertainty within the business environment. As a result, SMEs often faced obstacles during their operations. This thesis examines the relationship between financial management and profitability of SMEs to determine whether financial management practices and financial characteristics impact on SME profitability. Objectives of the thesis are (1) to investigate and describe features of financial management practices and financial characteristics of SMEs in Vietnam, (2) to develop and test a model of SME profitability, and (3) to contribute knowledge of the relationships between financial management and characteristics to improve SME profitability by using tools of efficient financial management. In terms of structure, the thesis has six chapters. The thesis begins by defining the research problem and questions, and providing a justification for the research study. Chapter one also reviews the research background, and presents definitions of terms, significance and scope of the study. Chapter two examines the economic background, business structure and the development of SMEs in Vietnam. This chapter also reviews previous research related to financial management for SMEs in Vietnam to identify gaps between financial management for SMEs in Vietnam and financial management for SMEs worldwide. Chapter three reviews financial management including financial management practices, financial characteristics and profitability of SMEs around the world, especially in the developed economies such as the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada. This review emphasizes profitability and the impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are to review previous research related to the areas of financial management practices, financial characteristics, and profitability of SMEs and to build a model of the impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. Chapter four discusses aspects of the research methodology including research design, data collection and data analysis methods, and hypothesis testing to support the model. Objectives of this chapter are: (1) to justify the research methodology of this study, (2) to explain research methodology used in the study, and (3) to demonstrate how research design, and data collection and analysis can be utilized in this study to answer the research questions outlined in the chapter 1. Data analysis and findings are presented in chapter five. This chapter presents descriptive findings of financial management practices, financial characteristics and SME profitability and findings of the research study related to testing the model of SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are (1) to systematically present the descriptive findings of the research study, (2) to interpret significance of these findings based on data analysis, (3) to present the results of testing the model of SME profitability, and (4) to explain how the model, developed from a literature review, was supported by data analysis. Finally, the thesis ends with chapter six where conclusions are summarized and applications of the research findings are indicated for the financial management practitioners. The thesis provides descriptive findings of financial management practices and financial characteristics and demonstrates the simultaneous impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. In addition, the research study provides a model of SME profitability, in which profitability was found to be related to financial management practices and financial characteristics. With the exception of debt ratios, all other variables including current ratio, total asset turnover, working capital management and short-term planning practices, fixed asset management and long-term planning practices, and financial and accounting information systems were found to be significantly related to SME profitability. With the findings as presented above, this research study provides many implications for financial management practices and contributes to knowledge of financial management of SMEs. The model of SME profitability can be used as guidance for actions to improve the profitability of SMEs in Vietnam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">financial characteristics</field><field name="subject">financial management practices</field><field name="subject">profitability</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/32</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling dynamics including recruitment, growth and mortality for sustainable management in uneven-aged mixed-species rainforests</field><field name="creator">Kariuki, Maina</field><field name="description">Changes in species abundance and richness, stand structure, and species responses to habitat characteristics including disturbance intensity, were investigated in 28 permanent sample plots (PSP) covering a total area of about 6.2 hectares of subtropical rainforests in north-east New South Wales, Australia. The disturbance that occurred over 36 years previously varied from unlogged (controls), through single-tree selection (light), moderate selection and repeated single-tree selection to intensive (heavy) logging. Multivariate and univariate approaches were used to investigate changes in various plant groups, including all vascular plants, regenerating species (trees and understorey species &gt; 1.3 m in height and &lt; 10 cm diameter at 1.3 m above the ground level (dbh)), juvenile trees (regenerating species capable of attaining at least 10 cm dbh), and trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh. In addition, dynamic parameters (recruitment, growth and mortality) were estimated using hierarchical multilevel modelling and parameter estimates used to simulate behaviour of the subtropical rainforest tree species in unlogged and logged stands, both within and beyond the range of available data.Chronological post-disturbance responses and changes in species abundance and richness as well as stand structure for trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh were investigated using 20 PSP in a bid to better understand rainforest post-disturbance regeneration. The results portrayed minor and gradual ecological changes in the undisturbed controls analogous with natural forest dynamics where the changes were not significant. In logged sites, initial gradual changes were followed with more rapid and significant changes.In both unlogged and logged stands, the changes proceeded through three clearly identifiable stages. The first two stages lasted between 5 and 15 years each. In the initial stage, the number of individuals decreased in species with high frequency mainly in the shade tolerant species, with little or no change in species richness. In the second stage, species abundance and richness changed due to localised species turnover, replacement and losses with very little recruitment, and the numbers of both speciesand individuals declined to minima. In the third stage, due to recruitment beyond the 10 cm dbh, the net loss of species and trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh were halted and reversed, and species diversity and abundance began to return to pre-disturbance levels.Species abundance and diversity for both shade tolerant and intolerant species in less intensively logged sites (single-tree selection logging) have recovered to levels comparable with that observed in the controls, but more intensively logged sites have not recovered to similar levels. Increased logging intensity was associated with increased and decreased densities in the shade intolerant and &#168;Ctolerant species respectively. It was evident that stand structure in logged sites had yet to recover to levels comparable with that of unlogged controls. It appears the restoration of floristic diversity to levels similar to that of intact primary forest takes considerably less time than structural recovery. Changes in regeneration patterns in a subtropical rainforest in north-east  New South Wales were investigated for a 13-year period during the 3rd and 4th decades following repeated single-tree selection logging. Multivariate and univariate analyses results showed that there were no significant differences in floristic assemblages within and between censuses; however, two contrasting trends of changes in plant groups were detected. In trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh, the stem density and species richness increased in shade tolerant group, and while stem density increased in the shade intolerant group, species richness decreased during the study period. Amongst smaller sized species including trees (&lt; 10 cm dbh), a general decrease in species richness was observed along with significant changes in stem densities (P = 0.03) with the number of individuals in the shade tolerant species increasing, while that of both shade intolerant and vine species decreased. Excluding the vines and understorey species from the broader regenerating species group, revealed a decrease in species richness in juvenile canopy tree, and a significant change in densities (P = 0.004) with the number of individuals in shade tolerant increasing, while that of shade intolerant trees decreased. A comparison between the canopy trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh and juvenile canopy trees group showed that these groups were tending towards similar floristic assemblages. These results suggest gradual replacement of shade intolerant by shade tolerant species as stands were tending toward later stages of recovery within the regeneration. The results also show that the inclusion of regenerating species in long-term studies is both complementary to the larger plant component and more revealing of both trends and changes.Species-specific estimates of shade tolerance and size structure at maturity derived from observations on 23 plots were used to intuitively group 277 vascular plant species into 3 main groups including full floristic (all together), shade tolerant and intolerant groups. The shade tolerant and intolerant groups were further grouped into smaller plants groups depending on the development stage and maximum size at maturity. These groups included regenerating species, juvenile trees, and trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh. Multivariate analyses of these nominated groups revealed that floristic assemblages were significantly associated with environmental gradients based on simple site characteristics.At the landscape (larger) scale, the floristic assemblages were significantly different between low (200-400), mid (400-700) and high altitude (over 700 meters above sea level). In addition, abundance of shade tolerant species including Doryphora sassafras Endl, Orites excelsa R.Br and Caldcluvia paniculosa (F.Muell) Hoogland was positively correlated with the altitudinal gradient. At the smaller (local) scale, intensively logged sites where large gaps were created had recovered their species richness, but effects of past logging were evident in trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh, especially trees greater than 50 cm dbh where species abundance in shade tolerant decreased significantly. Less intensively logged sites at mid altitude where a few stems were removed had recovered their species richness in respect to trees &#161;&#221; 10 cm dbh, but the small gaps created may have healed quickly for appreciable regeneration response to occur, as juvenile trees component was significantly different to that of the (unlogged) controls.The abundance of shade intolerant and juvenile shade tolerant tree species increased in concert with levels of disturbance and abundance of shade intolerant species such as Duboisia myoporoides R.Br, Acacia melanoxylon R.Br, Rubus moorei F.Muell and R. hilli F.Muell was positively correlated with the disturbance gradient. Increase in number of individuals of certain tree species was positively correlated with both disturbance intensity and topography (mid slope through lower slope to creek/gully), but negatively correlated with aspect (NE - NW). We concluded that logged sites are yet to recover their pre-logging stand structure and rainforest tree species were found in sites where favourable recruitment and growth conditions were the encountered. These results show that logged sites had not yet regenerated to the pre-logging stand structure. They also show that habitat characteristics including history of disturbance and topography can influence the floristic assemblages in the sub-tropical rainforests at both the small (local) and large (geographic) scales. This supports the environmental control model that states &#161;&#176;species are found at sites where they encounter favourable living conditions&#161;&#177;. Site characteristics as surrogate for some of these favourable living conditions were identified as useful potential variables to investigate the rainforest dynamic parameters (growth, recruitment and mortality) in both logged and unlogged stands.A quantitative model was developed using over 3 decades of data to describe and simulate the dynamics including recruitment, growth and mortality in unlogged stands and others subjected to different silvicultural regimes in uneven-aged mixed-species subtropical rainforests of north-eastern New South Wales. Hierarchical multilevel regression analyses including Poisson, Binomial and multinomial logit regression were used to estimate the rainforest dynamic parameters based on the assumption that trees perform differently in space and time, thus there are variations at both the plot and tree by measurement levels.Variations at the tree level required the botanical identity of trees to species level, and then the species-specific size at maturity and shade tolerance were used to classify species into 5 groups, each consisting of species with similar ecological characteristics. These groups were labelled as emergent and shade tolerant main canopy, shade tolerant mid canopy, shade tolerant understoreys, moderate shade tolerant and persistent, and shade intolerant pioneer tree species. Significant variables at the plot level including site characteristics such as topography (elevation, slope and aspect), and past disturbance were used as explanatory variables in species group models. The final model is as a classical matrix management-oriented model with an ecological touch and maximum size-dependent parameters of ingrowth and outgrowth. The model provides a tool to simulate stand performance after logging and to assess silvicultural prescriptions before they are applied in these types of forests.The simulations indicate that full recovery following a logging intensity where 47% of the overstorey basal area is removed with a checkerboard of logged and unlogged patches (group selection) on a 120-year cycle could enable sustainable timber production without compromising the ecological integrity in these forests. Following single-tree selection (33%), recovery takes about 150 years, and more intensive harvesting practices where 50-78% overstorey basal area is removed may take 180-220 years to recover. Pre-harvest climber cutting coupled with poisoning of non-timber species followed by intensive logging of merchantable trees would allow logging on a 300-year cycle. Shorter logging cycles may lead to changes in the forest structure and floristic composition where the overall species density is low with higher density of shade intolerant species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">modelling dyamics</field><field name="subject">sustainable management</field><field name="subject">rainforests</field><field name="subject">species abundance</field><field name="subject">distubance intensity</field><field name="subject">logging</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human face of organisational change</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Camille Ruth Ann</field><field name="description">This current study investigated a possible extension to existing transformational leadership models used during organisational change programs. Researching the literature provided some preliminary evidence there was a need to include a potential extension to transformational leadership models. The original models of transformational leadership involved looking at the staff members from an organisational perspective, whereas the potential extension, concerns the human aspects of organisational change. The potential new extension consists of four components: communication, team building, stress and coping and inter-group conflict. This possible extension to the transformational leadership models appeared to be an exciting addition as it addresses important human resource issues experienced during organisational change. The present study sought to further investigate whether these four components indeed were warranted and whether its components actually contributed to successful organisational change. The research methodology was exploratory, qualitative and based on a grounded theory approach (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1967). Using an embedded case study method, in-depth convergent interviews were undertaken in four hospitals undergoing considerable organisational change. Twenty-six managers, executives and staff were interviewed. It was found that the change managers themselves were enthusiastic about implementing change but were unable to offer effective support for staff. Staff and managers said that communication within the hospitals during the period of change was poor. Similarly there was a paucity of accurate information being disseminated. Managers and staff also revealed that they had experienced considerable stress during the period of change and they needed help in order to cope effectively. Varying levels of inter-group conflict were reported in all the hospitals studied and managers reported that changes were not being implemented appropriately. However, efforts at team building were non-existent in two of the hospitals studied. These findings provide strong support for managers and leaders to pay increased attention to communication, team building, dealing with conflict and managing stress during times of increased change. This study suggests that a potential extension of the four components could be added to, and thereby strengthen, the transformational leadership models of organisational change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transformational leadership</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">team building</field><field name="subject">stress and coping</field><field name="subject">inter-group conflict</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Human Resources Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walking two worlds: transformational journals of nurse healers, a hermeneutic phenomenological investigation.</field><field name="creator">Hemsley, Martin</field><field name="description">This research investigated the transformative and extraordinary experiences of nurse healers. The broad aim of the research was to promote the role of the healer in nursing by providing data on the experiences specific to nurse healers&#8217; evolution as healers. The research was theoretically informed by van Manen (1990, 1984) and utilised hermeneutic phenomenology. Van Manen&#8217;s emphasis on writing as the key element of phenomenology in lived experience research was employed to bring forth a sense of lived immediacy and aesthetic colour essential to phenomenological understanding. The thesis was also theoretically aligned with the conceptual model of nursing as a caring-healing profession, developed by Jean Watson (1999, 1990a, 1988, 1985a). In particular, this research drew on Watson&#8217;s explicit connection of nursing with healing and nursing practice with transformational, transpersonal and esoteric insights. There were eleven nurse (nine women and two men) participants in the study. All participants identified strongly as healers. Selection was based on how long, and important to the individual was their commitment to being a healer. The data collection method used was semi structured interview with a predominant focus on storytelling. The overarching theme of &#8216;Walking Two Worlds&#8217; was identified, and within that five essential themes were uncovered: (1) Belonging &amp; Connecting; (2) Opening to Spirit; (3) Summoning; (4) Wounding &amp; Healing Journey; and (5) Living as a Healer. Implications for nursing discussed include the need for the profession to provide support to nurse healers as they encounter challenging experiences and to allow for ontological flexibility regarding the esoteric aspects of human/spiritual experience revealed by this research. Further the need to extend the understanding invoked by healing beyond the obvious and opening vistas into experience which have been previously repudiated by domineering, narrow and spirit-denying powers in our society is also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">healers</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">holism</field><field name="subject">Watson's theory</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An alternative to existing Australian research and teaching models: the Japanangka teaching and research paradigm, an Australian Aboriginal model</field><field name="creator">West, Errol George</field><field name="description">I decided to write this thesis many years ago and in the process of &#8216;becoming&#8217; a Palawa man I finally understood the global agenda between black and white Australians and the direct actions required to attain a traditional form of Aboriginal democracy. I share in this understanding in this thesis. Mind you I share with trepidation because the options are very existential to the prevailing discourse. However a doctoral thesis will add to the body of knowledge not simply to confirm existing theoretical discourse or to leave this discourse un-challenged. Therefore this thesis is about the critical mass of cultural variables pertaining to teaching of Australian Indigenous peoples and the conduct of meaningful research. Its primary intent is to offer an alternative to the inappropriate methodologies that currently apply in the generic areas of pedagogy and research (in their broadest sense). In my opinion at present both these areas are pathologically dominated by Western thought. The idea of change and alternative paradigms is addressed in the introduction and this thesis is not intended to achieve anything more than a hearing of these options. This is why the discourse of this knowledge terrain in this thesis is so diverse and so demanding of the reader. The core notion of this discourse is the Japanangka Teaching and Research Paradigm.The Japanangka Teaching and Research Paradigm has as its core the articulation of eight dimensions or sub-paradigms. These are the quality of life dimensions: Cultural, Spiritual, Secular, and the other five: Intellectual, Political, Practical, Personal and Public dimensions. These eight constitute the sum of human experience relevant to the daily lives of Aborigines and as such are key categories to the unravelling of the seemingly imponderable mystery of &#8220;learning journey paths&#8221; so critical to the success of our students in formal Western education activities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of aromatherapy: a case study of the professionalisation of complementary and alternative medicine in the Australian health care system</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Janelle Gwen</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to examine aromatherapy practice in relation to its claim of being or becoming a profession. This process of professionalisation is explored within the current context where the status of complementary and alternative medicines within the Australian health care system, like aromatherapy practice, is currently influenced by medical dominance and broader social and political scrutiny. This investigation of aromatherapy practice may provide a model for the general professionalisation, or development, of complementary and alternative medicine in Australian health care today. Critical theory was employed as the primary methodology of this study. As critical theory has no defined method for data collection, grounded theory data collection and analysis methods were used to obtain current and relevant data from two of the most prominent users of aromatherapy practice in health care, aromatherapists and nurses.The study found that while aromatherapy is often referred to as a profession, it fails to meet the criteria for being considered a profession in the &#8216;true&#8217; sense. The data also revealed felt dissatisfactions experienced by aromatherapists&#8217; to be due to the lack of recognition of the practice and a perceived double bind regarding the need to establish an appropriate knowledge base via scientific research and maintaining the &#8216;essence&#8217; of aromatherapy practice. Considering the professionalisation process and the requirements of the system (health care and Government) a number of potential pathways for the development of aromatherapy practice were explored.

In choosing this focus, I intend to elucidate the interplay between social constructs of gender, power and technology as they enacted in a particular arena of artistic and economic activity. The nature of this interplay is informed by prevailing regimes of truth which have emerged through historical processes and which surface in diverse social contexts, of which this is but one. My intention here is to identify such regimes and to situate women's discourses within them. In this undertaking, I draw on a body of theory which lies at the conjunction of contemporary feminist critique and the later work of Michel Foucault on power and the 'technologies of the self' to explore a model of power which promises cogent strategies in the feminist project of reworking notions of gender and social agency.  The inquiry enlists the perspectives of women students in a university school of contemporary music through a guided interview process. The technologies referred to include musical instruments both of traditional and twentieth century design, as well as a range of sophisticated systems of equipment used for recording and amplifying, for composing and arranging music.  Through analysis of the interview data and through readings from social science and musicology, I identify a dominant discourse, or regime of truth, which privileges men and marginalizes women in the realm of techno-musical activity. Alongside this prevailing regime are women's discourses which both comply with and dissent from its assumptions. In examining these discourses, I seek insights into the processes by which women collude in their own exclusion from a male-colonized terrain, but also exercise power to insist on entry. The alignment of technology and masculinity in contemporary music creates serious training and employment disadvantages for women in many facets of the industry. I contend that this anomaly demands attention in the interests of socio-economic justice, in the interests of the industry itself through full utilization of human resources and market potential, and in the interests of women's desires to expand their creative options and employment opportunities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">voice</field><field name="subject">feminist research</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">audio engineering</field><field name="subject">Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Succession and community structure of reef flat algae at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia</field><field name="creator">Catterall, Claudia Frances</field><field name="description">There is little published information on the distribution, abundance, seasonality and ecological roles of benthic algae on the Great Barrier Reef, although they are of fundamental importance in the ecology of coral reef communities. This study sought to provide information on algal community dynamics in two contrasting reef-flat zones: the live coral and algal turf-dominated outer flat, and the fleshy macroalgaldominated inner flat, at Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia.Algal community structure on dead coral limestone was studied on the inner and outer reef flat over a three-year period (from May 1986 to February 1989), and algal transplant and grazer exclusion experiments were carried out to determine the role of grazers in producing and maintaining community structure.Changes during ecological succession provide useful information about structuring processes in natural communities. Algal succession was studied using artificial substratum (concrete), because it provided a flat surface which offered logistical advantages over naturally contoured coral substratum, and because previous studies had found that artificial substrata adequately mimicked natural surfaces in marine successional studies. Succession on natural substratum was also studied for comparison, using coral clumps which had died after a bleaching episode in February 1987. The effects of season on algal succession, were investigated using four series of concrete settlement blocks, started in February, May, August and November 1986. The effect of habitat complexity on succession was examined by comparing succession on an exposed concrete surface with succession on a protected concrete surface provided with crevices. Each successional study lasted two years. Cover data for all algal species present on each sample were obtained using a sampling grid of sixty points, and these data were analysed using the non-parametric multivariate analysis program, PRIMER.A total of 105 algal taxa were identified in this study, with 101 of these recorded in the natural reef flat algal community over the three-year period. Fleshy macroalgae were the dominant group on the inner flat (56% cover), and filamentous turf algae iv were dominant on the outer flat (47% cover). The importance of water temperature and grazing intensity in producing the differences in distribution of these two groups of algae on the reef-flat were considered. Temperature was rejected as a factor, because there was virtually no temperature difference between the two sites over a two-year period. Grazing was found to be an important factor, based on a much higher rate of damage to algal transplants on the outer flat than on the inner flat; and on the development of higher algal biomass on caged than on uncaged concrete settlement blocks.Between 58 and 69 algal taxa were recorded in each of the four successional studies on exposed concrete, 78 taxa were recorded on protected concrete, and 85 taxa were recorded on bleached coral. Algal successional trajectories were similar on concrete and on bleached coral, but the rate varied substantially. Succession was fastest on bleached coral, slowest on exposed concrete, and intermediate on protected concrete. On all substrata, at both sites, early dominance by green and brown filamentous algae decreased over time, while the abundance of other forms increased. Dominance in terms of cover by early successional algae (in particular Ectocarpus) was prolonged on concrete in comparison to bleached coral, and this effect was stronger on exposed concrete than on protected concrete.It is hypothesised that inhibition of algal community development on concrete because of a relatively dense growth of early successional algae was due to one or both of two factors: 1. Reduced algal recruitment due to a lower level of substratum heterogeneity; and 2. Reduced grazing by the dominant herbivores in the system, parrotfish (Family Scaridae), because of the hardness of concrete.Succession was faster on the outer flat than on the inner flat. On bleached coral, succession to a community similar to the natural background algal community took between three and nine months on the outer flat, and between one and two years on the inner flat.There was no regular seasonal pattern of change in the reef flat algal community over a three-year period, but during early succession, algal community structure was v strongly influenced by season of initial exposure of the concrete settlement blocks. However, this variability did not persist, and by two years all seasonal series of blocks had similar communities. Six species of algae were fertile within 10 days of establishment, including the common early successional algae Ectocarpus, Enteromorpha and Polysiphonia, illustrating the potential of these species for rapid exploitation of available space.The results of this study provide much needed baseline data on algal community dynamics on the southern Great Barrier Reef, and on succession and community development following a bleaching episode. Given the rapid and dense colonisation of bare substratum by algae, and the very low rate of recruitment by corals, it seems that corals will be at a disadvantage in maintaining their abundance in this reef flat environment if coral bleaching becomes a regular event.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algae</field><field name="subject">coral reef</field><field name="subject">succession</field><field name="subject">seaweed</field><field name="subject">substrate</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">coral bleaching</field><field name="subject">seasonality</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of female patients, caregivers and nurses of pain and pain management in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Ratchaburi Province, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Sriyotin, Benjawan</field><field name="description">The care of patients with pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is challenging and requires a systemic approach to assessment and treatment. This study aimed to explore with female patients, caregivers, and nurses, their perceptions of pain and pain management in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. The study involved 10 female patients, 12 caregivers, and 10 nurses. Grounded theory was used as the methodology. Each participant was interviewed for at least one hour for biographical data, and experiences of pain and pain management of rheumatoid arthritis. Interviewing was audiotaped for verbatim transcription. A manual method of thematic analysis was used to find codes and categories, and to generate a grounded theory. The results showed that patients, caregivers, and nurses perceived pain and the effects of the pain of rheumatoid arthritis in terms of degeneration, and the need for intimacy and vigilance respectively. Patients expressed their negativity to pain as dejection, and they acknowledged their solicitude and receptivity towards care. Caregivers and nurses felt close understanding and connectedness respectively. Patients emphasised attribution, and nurses focused on the difficulties associated with chronicity. Pain management was in terms of physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions for all participants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/8</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study into factors influencing the use of value-based management tools</field><field name="creator">Sakunasingha, Benjalux</field><field name="description">For management to perform its functions of planning, organizing, leading and controlling effectively, a control process has to be in place. This control process  should incorporate a target or standard measures and compares performance with the standard, evaluates results and takes any necessary corrective action. Hence, the introduction of the control process, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, has been recognized as a significant progression to ensure organizations achieve their objectives and goals.There are a number of performance measurement tools for management to select but one that stands out as possibly the preferred method is Value-based management (VBM). Value-based management, a relatively new concept, offers management a better way to measure performance in today&#8217;s business environment. The application of VBM links business strategy, finance, performance measurement and management processes all together to create value. VBM tells how the value of an organization is maximized, while developing corporate value is the best long-term measure to show how good the present management is doing its job. Therefore, VBM indicates the current situation as well as future prospects of an organization. Further, VBM helps managers and employees to obtain a sharper focus of the corporate vision and objectives based on one leading measurement indicator &#8211; that is to enhance corporate value. Unlike many performance measurement tools that may focus on many objectives, which may cause the lack of single focus for accountability for shareholder value, VBM provides a clearer objective focusing on the financial objectives across the organization. More importantly, VBM includes the cost of all capital required, while many performance measurement tools still provide incomplete information about cost.The purpose of this research is to study what organization factors influence the choice of performance measurement tools, such as VBM selected by management. This research also studies the manner in which the selection and the use of VBM might affect the performance of organizations in Thailand. A number of studies were made in the past dealing with the effectiveness of VBM.These studies analyzed how VBM assisted management in their administration and measurement of organizational activities. These researches add significantly to the body of knowledge and advance the concept of VBM. However, most researchers ignored an important aspect and that is, what factors influence the management to select and utilize VBM tools in their organization. This research attempts to address this knowledge gap, and answer the following questions: &#8226; What are the organization factors that could influence the selection and the use of VBM tools to measure organization performance? Then importantly,&#8226; Do the selection and the use of VBM tools improve organization performance?To examine and to properly evaluate the above questions, this research study identifies four key objectives. First, factors that influence management in selecting value based management tools to measure performance and set standards are to be identified. Second, identify the relationship between organization performance, the use of VBM and certain organization factors such as organization size, market share position and product life cycle stages. Third, study the impact of VBM on organization performance in the Thai environment. Fourth, provide information on how VBM is selected and used in the electrical and electronic industry in Thailand.The following three hypotheses were proposed to study the behaviour of variables:Hypothesis 1: Organization factors are not the determining factors for selecting and using VBM tools for performance measurement.Hypothesis 2: VBM tool selected and used by an organization do not influence its organization performance.Hypothesis 3: The relationship between organization factors and organization performance are not mediated by the VBM tools selected and used by an organization to measure organization performance.To test the hypotheses empirically, a mailed-survey questionnaire was used to collect data. A stratified sampling technique on a population of 462 Head of Finance/Accounting Departments of the Electrical and Electronics Industry of Thailand was employed. The above hypotheses were tested using several analytical techniques including regression model, correlation coefficient and factor analysis.The result of this research indicates that none of the chosen organization factors studied directly influences the selection and the use of VBM tools. In addition, the findings indicated a significant relationship between independent variables, which are organization size and market share position. But these two factors do not establish significantly relationship with the VBM or an organization performance. Further, although the product life cycle stage was not a factor that influenced the selection and the use of VBM tools, it showed a significant negative relationship with organization performance. This was regardless of whether or not the organization selected and used VBM tools. This indicates that the selection and the use of VBM tools are less preferable when the product of an organization is at the early stages such as emerging and growth stages. On the other hand, VBM tools are more preferred by an organization when its product reaches maturity. Finally, these research findings demonstrate that the selection and the use of VBM tools are significantly related to an improvement in organization performance. In other words, the performance of an organization improved with the use of the VBM tool.It is believed that this research is a first attempt to delineate factors that influence management to select and utilize VBM tools in their organizations. One nation, Thailand and one Industry, the electrical and electronic industry were used as the laboratory to test the hypotheses. It is hoped that future research will replicate this study in other industries and countries that would help to confirm the results of this study. Such studies will not only substantiate this research but also offer new insights into understanding the factors influencing the selection and the use of VBM tools. Different organizational factors, different performance measurement tools, and/or different methodologies in conducting the research showed further contribute to knowledge in this area. The research opportunities are considerable, especially in relation to cross-country comparisons based on performance measurements, using VBM tools and it is this type of research that will improve our understanding of the subject and lead to adoption of these measures in organizations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial performance</field><field name="subject">performance measurement</field><field name="subject">organization performance</field><field name="subject">value creation</field><field name="subject">value based management</field><field name="subject">VBM</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/39</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total quality management as the basis for organizational transformation of Indian Railways: a study in action research</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Madhu Ranjan</field><field name="description">The basic objective of this research was to assess the suitability of Total Quality Management (TQM) via the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000/2000 quality accreditation system route for bringing about organisational transformation in the Indian Railways and to develop an India specific model for taking an ISO certified organization towards TQM.The first part of the research aimed at getting the &#8216;as is&#8217; and &#8216;should be&#8217; status of Indian Railways from an organisational change point of view. Based on the work carried out by Khandwalla (1995), a series of open-ended and close-ended questions were asked to the senior members of Indian Railways. Analysis of their responses was undertaken. It indicated that the way they thought Indian Railways should change was in line with the TQM model of change.The culture-TQM fit was studied as a part of this research. &#8216;Hierarchy&#8217; (or power distance) and its related concept &#8216;collectivism&#8217; were identified as the two cultural constructs which affect the successful implementation of TQM. The second part of the research aimed at measuring the hierarchical orientation among the employees of Indian Railways. This was measured on three dimensions of &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;, &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; and &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; based on the work done by Sinha (1995). It was found that among the three dimensions, &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217; were more deeply  entrenched cultural traits among Indian Railway employees as compared to &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217;. On the two dimensions of &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;, the class 1 officers of Indian Railways were less hierarchy conscious than the class 2 officers who, in turn, were less hierarchy conscious than the supervisors. The tendency for &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; did not vary significantly either across the class 1 officer, class 2 officer and supervisor categories or across different age groups. Further, employees less than 30 years old, from 31 years to 50 years old and more than 50 years old, demonstrated similar level of &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;. This shows that at least in the Indian Railways, even among the younger generation, notwithstanding 15 years of liberalisation, hierarchical orientation continues to be a powerful cultural trait.The third part of the research aimed at understanding the impact of ISO 9000 implementation in the Indian Railway units. It was found that, contrary to the literature, there was no resistance to implementation of  ISO based change in the Indian Railways. This research argues that because of their strong sense of identity with their work group, the employees of Indian Railways are more amenable to an internal leader initiated change. Hence there was no resistance to change.The fourth part of the research was an action research project aimed at ISO 9000:2000 certification of a warehousing unit in the Indian Railways. This was carried out to investigate the way organisational learning occurred during ISO certification. Three action cycles were conducted over a period of two months. Seven months later, one additional cycle was completed. Special care was taken to see that the conclusions arrived after one cycle were validated from other sources. It was found that departmentalism and lack of team spirit are major problems in Indian Railways. Both are ascribed to the caste system in India. It is hypothesised that since an Indian Railway employee remains in a department throughout his/her career, the department becomes his/her &#8216;professional caste&#8217;. The research then identifies an Indianised version of leadership in the context of organisational change. It hypothesises that hierarchical teacher-student (guru-shishya) relationship with the leader invokes personal bases of power which promotes change in India. The teacher-student (gurushishya) relationship with the leader is conceptually similar to &#8216;intellectual stimulation&#8217; factor of transformational leadership. The &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; with a more equitable slant can be elevated to the status of &#8216;individualised consideration&#8217; factor of transformational leadership and the Nurturant Task (NT) leadership model of India is conceptually similar to the contingent reward factor of transformational leadership.In the context of TQM, this research hypothesises that there is a sequential relationship among the critical success factors (CSFs) of TQM. For this, one should begin by framing process-based quality procedures and quality objectives. Process based quality procedures and quality objectives lead to development of team orientation in the context of TQM implementation. Similarly, a multi-tier Corrective and Preventive  Action (CPA) reinforced with a reward and recognition system, positively intervenes in the transition of an ISO certified organization towards TQM.The learning arrived at in different parts of the research was finally integrated into a model for transforming an ISO certified unit towards TQM. The model shows that propagation of customer satisfaction as a value and not just as a measurement- as in a customer satisfaction index &#8211; is key for replacing some of the dysfunctional traditional Indian values which do not fit in a liberalised economy. More specifically, the compulsion of implementing a &#8216;Corrective / Preventive Action&#8217; makes a person come out of his/her traditional moorings and thus begins his/her socialisation outside his/her &#8216;professional  caste&#8217;. The reinforcing effect of successive improvement inculcates a feeling of team spirit among members of different functional groups. Successive CPAs supported by a suitable reward system and an Indianised version of leadership mentioned earlier create a spiral vortex which continually pulls the organization towards achieving TQM.Finally, this research establishes a link between the soft system methodology and an India specific cultural dimension called &#8216;context sensitivity&#8217;. The researcher argues that it is because of context sensitivity of Indians that no resistance to change was found during ISO implementation in Indian Railways. This also explains why post liberalisation Indians have been able to make a mark in the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Indian culture</field><field name="subject">ISO9000</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Indian railways</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Nurturant Task leadership</field><field name="subject">organisational transformation</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards, wellbeing : Creative inquiries into an experiential arts-based healing practice in Aboriginal contexts</field><field name="creator">Miller, Judith Christian</field><field name="description">This research project is located in the context of Aboriginal health and education, and in particular, emotional and social wellbeing, recognising the critical need for effective mental health services and resilient, well-trained workers in the field of mental health.Mental health is understood to include a broad spectrum of conditions with extreme and chronic mental illness at one end and resilience or wellbeing at the other &#8211; the socalled &#8216;soft end&#8217; of the social health spectrum. While recognising that the lines of demarcation between one category and another are grey, my thesis addresses the problems at the latter end of the spectrum: problems of excessive pain; the grief and despair caused by dispossession, loss of place, family and identity; and the deep frustration, humiliation and anger that results in family violence and child sexual abuse, intergenerational substance abuse, neglect and poor physical health. It is my position that very many Aboriginal people who need to make changes in their lives in order to feel well and functional in the world are not suffering from a Western disease but from the transgenerational consequences of colonisation. In recognition of the notion that Aboriginal wellbeing is everybody&#8217;s business, this PhD research project represents my response to these consequences.While popular assumptions are made about the relevance of art to Aboriginal health and many Aboriginal people testify to the fact that their engagement with art (writing, drama, dance, music and visual art etc.) has brought about significant change in their lives, there is no available research in Australia that supports the development of an arts-based approach to learning/therapy/wellbeing that has, for reasons that are well understood, the potential to suit the needs of Aboriginal people.Addressing this gap in the research, I inquire into an experiential, arts-based, emotionfocused, narrative-orientated, constructivist approach to healing in the tradition of humanistic psychology, which emphasises the importance of an emancipatory, clientcentred processes that facilitates the development of awareness, creativity, clarity of expression and critical reflection. The position I take breaks with the traditions of the biomedical model and conforms to the now widely held view that psychology and counselling treatment programs for Aboriginal people must address the whole person, emotionally/spiritually, mentally and physically, responding to the individual in his/her sociopolitical and historical context. Expressive arts therapy, the multi-modal approach to healing explored in this thesis, lays claim to these intentions.In this project, I locate myself as the researcher/practitioner whose life-stance is expressive of the phenomenological principles of experiential learning and reflexivity. Accordingly, I have drawn on a number of closely related research methodologies all of which, I argue, are consistent with phenomenology and Indigenous, participatory research practices: critical action research, art-based research and phenomenological research methodology. These modes of inquiry are linked through principles that value subjective experience and allow for a diversity of ways of knowing. Embracing an expanded field of ways of knowing respectful of Indigenous epistemologies is at the core of the arts-based therapy program under investigation.Expressive arts therapy, in this research project, was delivered in two modes: one was a series of nine full-day group workshops conducted over an academic semester; the other was a series of ten intensive individual therapy sessions with three participants conducted over the period of a year. The participants or &#8216;co-researchers&#8217; were drawn from the College of Indigenous Australian Peoples and the Education and Art departments at Southern Cross University. Three mature-age Aboriginal students who had engaged in the Masters of Indigenous Studies program emerged as the core participants who, having contributed to the development stage of the project, followed the program through the group workshops to the final interviews at the end of the series of individual sessions.This thesis is, in part, an illustrated narrative of the in-depth work the core participants did with me in both the context of the group and individually. It invites the active participation of the reader. Insights into the nature and impact of expressive arts therapy are offered through a focus on the lived experience of the three core participants, their reflections on the program and their observations of the changes they made in their lives. An important parameter that I set, determined that the ultimate voices of authority were to be those of the participants. I was not at liberty to look for meanings that went beyond their experience and understanding.I argue that the experiences of expressive arts therapy re-presented in this thesis demonstrate that expressive arts therapy is in principle consistent with current approaches to Aboriginal psychology and counselling currently recommended by Aboriginal professionals and spokespeople in the field of Aboriginal health. Furthermore this body of work demonstrates that expressive arts therapy is a culturally appropriate intervention grounded in a creative process that has the potential to facilitate healing and change in the lives of people suffering from the long-term consequences of damaging childhoods.It is my hope that this approach to healing will be further researched and developed and, with culturally appropriate terms of reference, adapted to a wide variety of existing community services &#8211; rightfully, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practitioners working for the wellbeing of their own people.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wellbeing</field><field name="subject">experiential learning</field><field name="subject">expressive arts therapy</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal mental health</field><field name="subject">social and emotional wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Arts-based healing</field><field name="subject">Community Health and Preventive Medicine</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry and Psychology</field><field name="subject">Public Health Education and Promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an integrated e-learning culture: a model grounded in the Australian Army experience</field><field name="creator">Newton, Diane</field><field name="description">Understanding the influences on e-learning effectiveness in workplaces is a necessary, but contentious task. The transfer of knowledge about e-learning from higher education to workplace situations has resulted in discursive tensions between expectations and practice. Measurement of the aspects of e-learning effectiveness is often discussed in the literature in terms of discrete economic, pedagogical and technological criteria. Few studies have investigated e-learning use in terms of the complexity of factors in a workplace environment and there is a scarcity of relevant substantive models of e-learning effectiveness factors in workplace contexts. This study aimed to improve understanding of the factors influencing e-learning effectiveness, particularly in large, dispersed workplaces and to develop a model based on the understanding of these factors. This study represents the first external research into the Australian Army&#8217;s e-learning projects. The Army was selected as a large, dispersed workplace organisation with ten years experience in designing and using multimedia rich CD-ROM learning materials. The Army had undertaken trialing and evaluation of its e-learning courses prior to providing substantial infrastructure for implementation in training centres. These evaluations indicated e-learning effectiveness in terms of training efficiencies and learning outcomes that at least matched traditional face-to-face classroom instruction. That is, that e-learning fitted with the training requirements. The study was aimed at the understanding of how the Army&#8217;s workplace environment was influencing the effectiveness of e-learning courses from multiple perspectives.Using an inductive Grounded Theory approach provided an established analytical method for developing a substantive model. While the field-based research was limited to a single organisation, it included multiple sites across Australia and a cross-section of e-learning activities and respondents throughout the organisational hierarchy. The main data source was 101 open-ended interviews conducted with respondents at Army bases or by phone. Where interviewing was not possible due to Army operational concerns, questionnaires were used (129 responses). Other data sources included Army documents and the researcher&#8217;s observations and participation in e-learning classes.While the Army&#8217;s internal evaluation processes had justified the adoption of e-learning courses, it was evident in the study that the interaction of factors within the Army&#8217;s culture was influencing perceptions and experiences of e-learning effectiveness. An Integrated E-learning Culture Model (IECM) based on the analysis of stakeholder perspectives in the Army is presented. The IECM is based on the four factors that emerged as influencing e-learning effectiveness, which were organisational priorities, the learning environment, the instructor&#8217;s role and learners&#8217; needs. The main concern for respondents was to manage tensions associated with these four factors by integrating e-learning into the organisational culture. That is, e-learning effectiveness was discussed in terms of a process of alignment of the e-learning culture with the organisational culture.Comparison of the IECM with some empirical studies of e-learning use in other large, dispersed workplaces indicates its relevance outside the Army context. An E-learning Comparative Alignment Framework (ECAF) for using the IECM in other research was developed in this study. Further comparison of the ECAF with alignment theories from related research disciplines suggests areas for further theoretical research. This thesis proposes that by adopting the perspective that e-learning environments are not value-free, it is possible to identify and align the competing priorities and discourses that influence how e-learning effectiveness is constructed and experienced in an organisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research</field><field name="subject">Instructional Media Design</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grey matters: does Bacopa monnieri improve memory performance in older persons</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Annette Kay</field><field name="description">Background This thesis investigated the efficacy and safety of Bacopa monnieri in improving memory in healthy Australians over the age of 55-years. A review of the literature showed that memory impairment and dementia are increasingly prevalent in the current demographic climate of an ageing population. As well as the pathological cognitive loss of neurodegenerative disease, many older persons are experiencing memory loss as part of the physiological process of ageing.  Bacopa monnieri is a herbal medicine used since antiquity in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system of India for its cognitive enhancing effects. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies support this traditional usage. Laboratory studies have demonstrated antioxidant and cholinergic actions in the brain as well as improved memory and cognitive performance in animal models.  Human trials of Bacopa have also demonstrated improved memory performance. Some of these trials are limited by methodological flaws such as lack of blinding, small sample sizes, or use of outcome measurements which are not well validated. However, a small number of well designed human trials provide evidence for efficacy in cognitive and memory performance improvement. The current study was employed to extend on previous findings by assessing the efficacy and safety of Bacopa in the aged population specifically, as it is in this population that memory impairment becomes apparent.  Aims 1. To assess the efficacy of Bacopa monnieri in improving memory in healthy Australians over the age of 55-years. 2. To assess whether the use of Bacopa is associated with side-effects  Design A 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial.  Participants Participants were self selected from the general population. They were aged 55-years or over at the commencement of the trial. Participants were without dementia, depression or other serious health conditions and did not use psychotropic medications.  Intervention Participants were randomised to one of two treatment conditions, either a tableted extract of Bacopa monnieri called Bacomind&#8482; (300mg/day, standardised to contain at least 40% bacosides), or an identical placebo.  Participants attended three clinical evaluations: the first an initial screening session, the second a baseline evaluation of neuropsychological function and subjective memory performance at the commencement of the trial and the third, an end-of-trial outcome evaluation at 12-weeks, during which neuropsychological function and subjective memory performance were again assessed along with side-effects and study compliance.  Primary Outcome Measures Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (CFT), Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and Trail Making Test (TMT)  Results From 136 people who elected to participate, 103 people met study entry criteria and 98 of these commenced the trial. Of these, 81 participants completed the trial and provided evaluable data for the end point analysis. Bacopa monnieri versus placebo significantly improved verbal learning as well as delayed recall as measured by the AVLT (p&lt;.05). Though improvements were noted in the CFT, MAC-Q and TMT, there were no significant differences between placebo and active groups found for these tests. The Bacopa group reported a higher incidence of gastro-intestinal (GIT) side-effects than the placebo group, these predominantly being increased stool frequency, abdominal cramps and nausea. No other significant adverse effects were found.  Conclusions A clinical trial was carried out to assess the effects of 12-weeks administration of Bacopa monnieri (300mg/day) on memory performance in people over the age of 55-years. Primary outcome measures were well validated neuropsychological tests that objectively measured verbal and visual memory and a memory complaint questionnaire that measured subjective memory complaints.  The results demonstrated that Bacopa significantly improved memory acquisition and retention in older Australians. This concurs with findings from previous human and animal studies, as well as supports traditional Ayurvedic claims and uses. The beneficial effects on memory observed may be due to previously demonstrated antioxidant and cholinergic effects of the herb on the central nervous system.  The use of Bacopa was associated with GIT side-effects, particularly increased bowel movements, nausea and abdominal cramping, findings infrequently reported previously. Possible explanations for these side-effects include GIT irritation by the saponin constituents of the herb, or cholinergic stimulation of autonomic and motor responses in the GIT, or a combination of both of these factors. The side-effects observed in the current study provide supportive evidence that Bacopa may increase cholinergic activity in humans.  A worthwhile future extension of the current study would be to assess whether the finding of Bacopa&#8217;s efficacy for improving memory performance is replicable in populations with either mild cognitive impairment or early dementia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacopa monnieri</field><field name="subject">Brahmi</field><field name="subject">Bacopa</field><field name="subject">memory improvement</field><field name="subject">memory performance</field><field name="subject">cognitive improvement</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Natural Products Chemistry and Pharmacognosy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/59</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of quality management in pathology laboratories</field><field name="creator">Burnett, Leslie</field><field name="description">Objective: To assess the feasibility of applying Quality Management philosophies and techniques to pathology laboratories. Design: Series of case studies. Setting: Two tertiary referral pathology laboratories in Australian University teaching hospitals. Intervention: Application of Continuous Quality Improvement techniques to complex laboratory processes; Implementation of formal Quality Systems into laboratories; Introduction of a new Laboratory Information System. Measurement: Measurement of changes in key performance indicators. Results: Statistically significant improvements in a variety of key performance indicators, reduction in frequency of incidents, and improvement in surrogate clinical outcomes were achieved using Quality Management approaches in pathology laboratories. Comparison of environments associated with introduction of a new Laboratory Information System identified the presence of a formal Quality System as a key factor associated with superior laboratory performance. Conclusion: Quality Management can be applied successfully to a variety of pathology laboratory environments, and can result in significant improvements in product and service quality. A key success factor in implementing Quality Management may be the introduction of a formal Quality System.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality management</field><field name="subject">pathology</field><field name="subject">laboratory medicine</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">CQI</field><field name="subject">Medical Pathology</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/58</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New information and communication technologies and community radio stations</field><field name="creator">Coates, Wendy Lee</field><field name="description">This is an investigation of the diffusion of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly the Internet, by community broadcasting organisations. In order to understand ICT diffusion processes in community radio stations, this study focuses on a particular project which saw a large scale diffusion of Internet technologies across Australian community radio stations at the beginning of 1998. The Community Access Network (CAN) project was an initiative of the Australian government, and saw funding for the provision of an Internet ready computer to every licensed community radio station in Australia. In approaching this subject, this research employed social constructivist assumptions, expecting that ICT use, and in particular the CAN workstations, would vary from station to station, reflecting the cultural and organisational conditions in each environment. As such the study aimed to understand the ways in which ICT technologies have been used and understood by community ralo station management and their participants. Since community radio stations are organisations, this study employed Everett Rogers' framework for understanding diffusion of innovation processes within organisations, acknowledging that organisational variables act on innovation behaviour in a manner over and above that of the aggregate of individual members of the organisation. This approach provided scope for the investigation and comparison of organisational factors, as well as meaning making on the part of individual participants. The research was based on data collected from two case studies, chosen on the basis of their divergent social, cultural and organisational environments; 4EB in Brisbane, a metropolitan, ethnic community radio station; and 2NCR-FM in Lismore, a regional, generalist community radio station. Ethnographic methods of observation and interviews were employed to collect qualitative data, providing insider accounts of community broadcaster's use, experience, and understanding of the new technologies in their day-to-day broadcast practices. By looking at two different community radio stations, this research acknowledges points of similarity and difference across these organisational situations, identifying factors that contribute to variation in technology take-up in particular station programming emphasis, perception of need, organisational resources, role of innovation champions, training, ICT policy and broadcaster variables. Evidence drawn from these case studies, and the specific ICT investigated, contributes to a general understanding of factors in the diffusion of ICT technologies across the community broadcast sector, providing a frame of reference for anticipating subsequent innovation diffusion. In particular, there are implications for future diffusion projects which plan to deploy new technologies across the community radio sector. It also contextualises community broadcasting and ICT use within the field of new technology uptake by broadcast sectors in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community radio</field><field name="subject">community broadcasting</field><field name="subject">community media</field><field name="subject">information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">diffusion of innovations</field><field name="subject">Communication Technology and New Media</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/57</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jobless families in regional New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Hartman, Yvonne A</field><field name="description">At a time when welfare regimes in Anglophone countries are being reshaped to reflect neoliberal ideology, there is little by way of empirical, qualitative research which directly addresses the question of how jobless families live or are affected by their circumstances, particularly in regional Australia. This study combines a consideration of questions of social structure as they pertain to jobless families at the theoretical level with an ethnographic journey into their life worlds. It aims to understand the impact of long-term joblessness upon the families and to explore the interconnections between system and life world.I adopt Layder&#8217;s (1997, 1998) theoretical and methodological formulations as the most appropriate means to underpin an investigation of this nature. The study is comprehensively situated within a structural context which examines discourses and events that have exerted an influence on our present social arrangements, including an analysis of relevant social policy. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with two non-purposive samples and analysed using a modified Grounded Theory approach as advocated by Layder (1998).It was found that the current welfare regime helps to stabilise the capitalist global economy and does at least provide a precarious stability for those excluded from the labour market. Whilst families receiving long-term income support are not a homogeneous group, they are subject to hidden injuries in common. The linkages between system and life world are theorised in terms of the displacement principle, which holds that the displacement of a problem does not solve it, but merely relocates it elsewhere. It is used to explain both large-scale displacements as well as micro processes occurring within jobless families. Long-term joblessness is found often to have destructive consequences for intimacy, though family structure may remain intact. This is partly due to a welfare regime which disrespects its beneficiaries. I argue that social policy must be informed by an alternative discourse which includes social or welfare rights as a part of human rights, based upon recognition of mutual interdependency and an ethic of care. This is vital if future policy directions are to accord equal respect to all citizens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">joblessness</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">welfare state</field><field name="subject">Family, Life Course, and Society</field><field name="subject">Social Welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the achievement of success in e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry: a case study of the Shanghai Brilliance Group</field><field name="creator">Xuan, Weibing</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of the internet and e-commerce provide new opportunities for China&#8217;s retailers, and a new battle for China&#8217;s retail industry has begun. The purpose of this research is to explore the barriers and factors for achieving successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry. Some past studies have investigated the success of e-commerce in the western context. This study aims to partially fill the gap created by the lack of research into e-commerce in the Asian context, by investigating successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry, and is based on a case study of the Shanghai Brilliance Group. Therefore, the research question is &#8216;How can successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry be achieved?&#8217; Accordingly, three research issues are addressed:Research issue 1: How is e-tailing being used in the Shanghai Brilliance Group?Research issue 2: What are the barriers to the implementation of e-tailing in theShanghai Brilliance Group?Research issue 3: What are the factors for achieving successful e-tailing in theShanghai Brilliance Group?To investigate the research question and the three research issues, the following approaches were applied. Firstly, three parent disciplines were reviewed, namely, ecommerce, retail in China, and e-tailing success factors, in order to generate the research gap and a theoretical model. A theoretical model was developed, which included six factors and their variables. These six factors are: senior management factors, organisational factors, e-commerce strategies, external factors, consumer factors, and ecommerce system measurements. Secondly, the primary data for this research were collected from interviews (16 in-depth interviews and 3 focus group interviews) and a survey questionnaire (200 valid questionnaires).The findings for the first research issue showed that e-commerce is poorly implemented in the Shanghai Brilliance Group and its subsidiaries, but that e-commerce in the supermarket subsidiaries is more advanced than in the department stores. Only one department store is offering online shopping to their customers, while both supermarket subsidiaries offer online shopping. The rest of the department stores only use websites for advertising and promotion, or for limited customer service, such as award point checking. Moreover, only the Oriental Shopping Centre and Lian Hua Supermarket have specific teams or an out-sourced company controlling their e-commerce project. This shows that e-commerce is not being taken seriously in the Shanghai Brilliance Group to date.In relation to the second research issue, a total of nineteen barriers were identified from the interview data. Those barriers can be divided into two categories, namely, external barriers and internal barriers. Most of those barriers are consistent with those mentioned in the literature. However, some new barriers emerged from the data analysis process, including the mission of the organisation, and high profit objectives.The findings in relation to research issue 3 identified other important factors of e-tailing, besides those barriers answered in research issue 2. Most of the success factors reviewed in the literature were confirmed by the collected data and in addition, some new variables were explored. Overall, six groups of factors and 64 variables were addressed in this research as success factors for e-tailing. This included 57 out of the 59 variables which were previously mentioned in the literature and seven emergent variables.This research has made a contribution to both the theory and practice of e-tailing.Through qualitative analysis, this research not only identifies the important factors of e-tailing, but also generates a comprehensive model to guide the implementation of e-tailing by China&#8217;s retailers, especially the Shanghai Brilliance Group. Furthermore, this is the first study to investigate successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry. Accordingly, the proposed framework of this study provides a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-tailing</field><field name="subject">China retail industry</field><field name="subject">success factors</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">E-Commerce</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/49</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retailers&#8217; perceptions of product brand equity: an empirical study of Vietnamese independent grocers</field><field name="creator">Tran, Quan Ha Minh</field><field name="description">In the literature on product branding, significant attention has been paid to brand equity in the consumer context, but relatively little attention has been paid to the application of the concept of brand equity to the business-to-business context. Even less research has been conducted on the role of brand equity in the retailing context. Retailers are assumed to be irrelevant to the source of brand value for manufacturers, with the result that manufacturers do not target retailers to help them build strong brands. Therefore, there is potential for some channel conflict to occur between manufacturers and retailers. On the one hand, retailers may tend to focus on building their own, private brands to differentiate themselves from other retail competitors and to increase their power in relation to manufacturer brands. On the other hand, retailers also need to create a good image in the consumer marketplace by selling famous, manufacturer-branded products. In other words, retailers often have to sell famous brands even if they would prefer to sell other brands, or their own. Manufacturers therefore tend to focus on building strong brand associations in consumers&#8217; minds, in order to control retailers&#8217; power.There is an argument that traditional ways of thinking about brands, i.e. only from the consumer perspective, has produced &#8216;both an incomplete analysis of branding from an academic perspective and incomplete management of the brand from a company perspective&#8217; (Webster 2000). The relationship between manufacturers and retailers should be viewed as a partnership instead of competition for consumer loyalty (Narus &amp; Anderson 1986). Powerful consumer brands not only provide value to manufacturers and consumers, but they also offer many obvious benefits to retailers. These benefits include an established consumer demand; favourable consumer attitudes towards the branded product found in their store; a commitment from manufacturers to promote their products; and the credibility and image of the brand itself as an enhancement of the retailer&#8217;s own credibility and image(Webster 2000). Brand equity, therefore, needs to be investigated from the retailers&#8217; perspective, in order to provide a more complete understanding of the role of branding in marketing strategies. This research attempts to bridge this gap by exploring the customer-based brand equity concept from the retailers&#8217; perspective. It aims to explore how consumer-based brand equity theory translates to the retailer context, incorporating the key constructs of brand association, brand trust, brand loyalty, manufacturer support and the performance of the brand.The study was conducted in the context of the Vietnamese independent retail grocery sector. This context was chosen on the basis that there has been limited research conducted on branding in the Vietnamese context and due to the prominence of the independent grocery sector in the retail industry of Viet Nam. A survey questionnaire was developed based on the review of the relevant branding and retail literature and was administered to a sample of 400 independent grocery retailers in Ho Chi Minh City. This sample was drawn from a commercial mailing list of independent retailers. Selected retailers were contacted by phone and invited to participate in the research by completing the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview at their premises. They were asked to respond to the survey in relation to a major brand of soft drink sold within their product range. The soft drink product category was selected for this study due to it being one of the most common types of products sold by the independent retail sector in Viet Nam, which would ensure that all participants could easily share their opinions of the value of brands.Following a pilot study testing the survey instrument, the main data collection phase resulted in 355 completed and useable surveys being available for analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the relationships between the branding constructs of interest. The findings show that the theoretical model has fit with the data. Nine out of twelve hypotheses are supported to answers four research question.The finding indicates that brand equity plays an important role in the retailing context, and it is comprised of three dimensions - brand association, brand trust and brand loyalty. Brand association is reflected in the positive image of a brand in the retailer&#8217;s perception, related to their needs and wants. This leads to a positive feeling towards that brand, which is the trust a retailer holds in a manufacturer&#8217;s brand. As the result of a strong brand, retailers commit to a long-term business relationship with the brand&#8217;s manufacturer. Two of these three dimensions of retailer-based brand equity, (brand association and brand loyalty) are positively and significantly related to the brand&#8217;s performance at the retail outlet. Manufacturer support, including advertising, sales promotion and trade promotions has been confirmed by this study to be an antecedent of retailer-based brand equity. Moreover, this study indicated that there is a difference between the retailer-based brand equity model for local brands compared to international brands, in that brand association is the most important factor in retailer-based brand equity in the international brands model while brand loyalty is the most important factor in the local brands model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retailer based brand equity</field><field name="subject">brand equity</field><field name="subject">retail trade Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing unit trust performance</field><field name="creator">Tng, Cheong Sing</field><field name="description">Bank-managed equity funds are not inferior to their non-bank counterparts. Previous research reporting relative underperformance of bank-managed funds ignored their differing fiduciary standards. To evaluate bank and non-bank funds facing similar fiduciary responsibilities, domestic retail funds approved for Singapore&#8217;s Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme were examined, as they meet the same standard for managing social security savings. Returns from these funds correlate highly with market performance. Even though these fund returns exceeded guaranteed interest rates, they did not outperform their market index.With financial market deregulation in Southeast Asia, local banks in small economies withstand erosion of business by foreign competitors. Banks, in order to increase profits, compete with local as well as foreign insurance and investment companies by offering mutual fund products. To remain competitive, banks need to shed their reputation for not being able to generate impressive fund returns, as their funds are not inferior to those from insurance and investment companies in terms of assets under management, expenditures, returns and risk. To gain competitive advantage, banks can differentiate their fund characteristics and reduce portfolio management costs.Mutual fund characteristics can affect expected returns or transaction costs. Factors affecting expected returns include asset allocation and systematic risk, while transaction costs include explicit and implicit ones, which can be measured by expense ratios and size of funds respectively. Insignificance of transaction cost determinants in affecting actual returns can be attributable to dominance of factors affecting expected returns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assets under management</field><field name="subject">bank-managed fund</field><field name="subject">expense ratio</field><field name="subject">financial institution</field><field name="subject">fund performance evaluation</field><field name="subject">mutual fund management</field><field name="subject">unit trust</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards improvement in aviation safety in Thai Airways International Public Company Limited: a model</field><field name="creator">Suthichoti, Supachoke</field><field name="description">Thai Airways International Public Company Limited (THAI) is a very large organization compared to Thai standards. It generates huge incomes to a number of families, directly and indirectly. Like many airlines, the main concern with THAI and the regulatory authorities is safety because THAI is in a mass transportation business. THAI have had two accidents within a span of some six years, killing a total of 214 people. The accidents affected THAI in four key areas, namely political, economical, social and technological. This phenomenon prompted the study of aviation safety in THAI. The question that requires an answer is: &#8220;How should THAI build its protocols to enhance aviation safety?&#8221; This then became the research question. The objective of the study is to build a model suitable for THAI to enhance aviation safety, thus answering the question. Through a review of the literature within the parent disciplines, the product, process, and customers of flying activities were identified. The four processes, the MP, the HRD, the PM and the RS are recognized through rigorous search of the literature. The developments of the required seven elements of skills needed for pilot performance measurement were made.A review of study within the immediate discipline concerning Aviation Safety in THAI was carried out and the current status in THAI was defined. All of these led to the identification of research question, research objective, and research propositions. The research propositions were:&#8226; Research Proposition 1: that the management practice (MP) process receives inputs from the reporting system (RS) process. Outputs from the management practice (MP) process form inputs for the human resource development (HRD) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 2: that the human resource development (HRD) process receives inputs from the management practice (MP) process. Outputs from the human resource development (HRD) process form inputs for the performance measurement (PM) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 3: that the performance measurement (PM) process receives inputs from the human resource development (HRD) process. Outputs from the human resource development (HRD) process form inputs for the reporting system (RS) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 4: that the reporting system (RS) process receives inputs from the performance measurement (PM) process. Outputs from the reporting system (RS) process form inputs for the management practice (MP) process. &#8226; Research Proposition 5: that the individual process components identified in Research Propositions 1, 2, 3 and 4, can be consolidated into an overall, comprehensive Continual Improvement (CI) loop.Once the research propositions were established, the research design was conceived. Due to the fact that THAI is a unique airline influenced by its history of inception and by particular sets of cultures, an embedded, single case-study research method was used. Many techniques within the case-study method were employed starting from a secondary data search, direct observations, focus group interviews, elite interviews, pilot study, participant observations and in-depth interviews. Issues such as validity, reliability, sensitivity, generalizability and ethics were referred to. Issues on data processing, coding, editing, and interpreting were made and discussed.As a result of the various methods of study and the fieldwork previously mentioned, findings were derived. These were then edited, categorized, coded, tabulated and interpreted into meaningful information. Findings from the study and fieldwork supported all the propositions derived from secondary data search and literature review. Consequently the gap identified in the literature was now filled and the principal model was drawn. A slight modification was introduced in keeping with the interpretation of the findings. A recommendation was made that THAI implement policy measures and professional practices derived from the implication of the study to minimize risks in flight operations system and thus maximize safety.Based on the findings of this research, it is recommended that future studies be conducted employing a deductive, quantitative, statistical method to evaluate the model and test its theoretical implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai Airways</field><field name="subject">aviation safety</field><field name="subject">pilot performance management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifting (com)positions on the subject of management: a critical feminist postmodern ethnography of critical care nursing</field><field name="creator">Ogle, Kaye Robyn</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study investigated nurses&#8217; experiences of managing nurses and being managed by nurses within the context of a critical care unit. The four specific aims of the study were to: valorise and make space from which nurses could speak of their management perceptions and experiences; investigate and interrogate the cultural practices and knowledges that comprised and reinscribed the discourses of nursing management; identify the marginal, contradictory or subjugated discourses in the form of alternate or oppositional knowledges and practices embedded in nurses&#8217; experience; and reveal how participants were inscribed by or resisted the various discourses, including the multiple and mobile subject positions they adopted. The ethnography was theoretically informed by critical, feminist, and postmodern perspectives. Utilising the strategy of writing from the authorial position of occupying a mobile or nonunitary subjectivity, the research highlighted the methodological tensions so as to struggle for social justice whilst contesting the romance of knowledge as cure (Lather, 2000). Music was metaphorically appropriated to interrupt, subvert, and draw attention to the partial, interpretive, and intertextual nature of ethnographic representation and to represent the feminine other in a thesis normatively privileging written text. Conducted over a period of ten months, direct participant observation, individual interviews, and reflective field notes comprised the data. Eleven registered nurses, from all levels of the nursing hierarchy, participated in the study, in addition to the researcher. The findings of this research revealed nurses experienced feeling abnormal, lonely, angry, and rejected. Interprofessional relations reflected a lack of individual valuing and predominantly vertical violence. Shifting subject positions were primarily informed by dominant instrumental, patriarchal, managerialist, and modernistic discourses that homogenised the identity of nurses and defined the meaning of progress and normal. Management activities were deemed superior to the activities and being of a clinical nurse. Alternate and subjugated discourses included notions of teamwork, equality, mateship, and viewing management as superfluous and contemptuously. Patriarchal behaviours separating personal life from work life were contested, and behaviours often denigrated and stereotyped as female were valued. Valuing and sharing being human within ordinary nursing work, valuing work for the enjoyment of the work itself, and viewing power as with rather than over were further alternate discourses. The major implications from this study for nursing as a profession relate to nurses explicitly and foremost valuing their own practice and fostering a culture that genuinely permits individual diversity to alter the existing pre-scripted relations that constrain nurses&#8217; ability to engage in more meaningful interpersonal relations. Questioning current discourses and practices that value specific economic and scientific knowledges, support patriarchal behaviours, and silence nurses is essential. The articulation of alternative discourses that value women and nursing is crucial for reconstructing a reality that does not result in women and nurses feeling abnormal, rejected, and alienated; particularly within the context of a nursing shortage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensive care</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">Health and Medical Administration</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grow or go: a theory-building study regarding the survival and growth of micro-small enterprises:  action-oriented research conducted at Werbedruck Petzold, Gernsheim, Germany</field><field name="creator">Nogare, Lydia Dalle</field><field name="description">In general terms, this research project evolved in response to my desire to find out more about the planning issues faced by micro to small-sized enterprises (MSEs). In particular, how they plan for survival and growth.As such, the main objective of the action oriented research project is to assess the viability of developing a framework which will be capable of providing structured, useful and relevant  guidance to micro to small-sized enterprises (MSEs) in terms of business survival and growth. In a practical sense, it is important that the framework is also flexible enough to deal with the complexity and fluidity of the real life business environment within which MSEs operate.A review of current growth theory and the current available data and tools aimed at assisting MSE in the area of growth planning is presented in chapter two. This review serves to highlight two important issues which, in turn, guide the research project.- Firstly, an attempted review of current statistical information regarding MSEs highlighted a serious lack of general planning data for this sector within Europe. (Statistics are only analysed and reported for companies with over 20 employees)- Secondly, extant literature regarding growth theories for MSEs, fails to provide one perfect solution. There is a general consensus that it is neither possible, nor desirable, to try to develop one single and fixed model to predict company growth.Chapter two also provides a review of associated disciplines which are closely related to MSE planning ie entrepreneurship, innovation, and complexity. This extended review shows that flexibility and adaptiveness have a great impact on business decisions regarding company survival and growth and further strengthen the case for a flexible solution. Through consideration of these related topics the following three concepts are brought to the fore and are subsequently integrated into the final response to the research questions: - inherent company leadership,- the influence of the external environment and the opportunities and threats it presents to a MSE, - the internal factors which impact MSE company operations and decisionsAs such, Chapter two highlights the need for a bespoke solution which is both reactive and conditional. In order to focus the project, several delimitations were introduced.- Geographically, the research was based upon the prevailing conditions for German and central European MSEs.- Furthermore, a single case study company was selected as it suited the participative requirements of the project. The company is a micro-sized offset printing house.- As the project advanced, it became clear that decisions regarding company survival and growth for MSEs varied greatly depending upon the stage of operations in which the company found itself. Thus, a more specific focus on mature MSEs was adopted as the project and research progressed. By placing these three restrictions on the research project it was possible to conduct meaningful action-oriented research, aimed at generating future action and change  beyond the study, as well as identify and address a very specific set of research problems, namely:Main problem:How can managers of mature micro to small-sized offset printing plants in German/central Europe plan for survival and grow into the future?Sub problems:a. Can a management decision tool be developed to assist this decision and growth process in the mature company?b. How would such a tool be formulated to ensure both effectiveness and acceptance? (what factors should it consider)The key concepts introduced via the extant literature were then integrated into a soft systems review, supported by action-oriented research, in an effort to develop a flexible framework aimed at addressing the research problems.Several phases of research serve to support and build upon, or refine, one another to establish a more relevant and meaningful solution. A preliminary research phase comprising a Delphi study and convergent interviews was supported by group feedback sessions conducted with a small work group from the case study company &#8211; Werbedruck Petzold. The work group reviewed aspects of the developing framework at various stages throughout the project; each time participants were able to refine concepts and enhance the response to the main research problem. Chapters three, four and five present this conceptual development and testing/evaluation process. They also highlight the robustness of the data stemming from repetitive cycles and triangulation techniques integrated into the research design. The ultimate contribution to knowledge which evolved from the action-oriented research is presented in the form of a three-step framework which acknowledges - the overriding and inherent wishes of the MSE&#8217;s owner/manager - the opportunities and threats posed by the external environment, and- the mix of functions each MSE must develop to meet its own specific goals, given its own environmental situation. It is important to note that the response to the research problem is not a fixed model which can be systematically applied to all MSEs. But is rather a flexible framework which is intended to be actioned by MSEs, given their own situations and goals. The key to the proposed framework is that it must be continually reviewed to reflect the &#8216;current reality&#8217; of a MSE. It is basically a framework which has been developed via action oriented research techniques and is intended for ongoing case-specific, action, review, and refinement. It represents a shift in growth theory for MSEs as it embraces and promotes contingency, thus better reflecting the reality of MSEs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-small enterprises &#8211; Germany</field><field name="subject">small business &#8211; Germany</field><field name="subject">action-oriented research</field><field name="subject">small business - research</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/33</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Best practice features and practices guiding community service organisation governance</field><field name="creator">Jones, Christopher Randall</field><field name="description">The review of the literature and the results gained from this research suggest an important link between the effectiveness of a board, including its corporate governance practices, and organisational effectiveness. This link attests to the importance of a greater focus upon the governance approach used by organisations. There is extensive literature about corporate governance in the business sector and there is emerging research into corporate governance in the Third Sector. However there is very little literature about the community service component on the Third Sector in Australia and none in relation to community service organisations that are incorporated under the Tasmanian Associations Incorporation Act 1964. This thesis aims to discover what is defined as best practice in the area of corporate governance for Tasmanian community service organisations and if selected organisations have adopted that best practice. For this purpose a research problem and three research sub-problems are identified. The research adopts a case study approach as the main research methodology using interviews, document reviews and a short self assessment questionnaire as data collection tools. The researcher approached six incorporated community service organisations funded by the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services and they agreed to participate in the research. Following data collection and data analysis the following major findings emerge. Firstly, that case organisations have adopted a range of governance practices. There are significant gaps in some organisations and there is room for improvement in all of the case organisations. Secondly, that some case organisation boards are approaching corporate governance by managing compliance to a minimum standard although others are offering strategic leadership with a commitment to quality and best practice. Thirdly, the research identifies a number of factors that impact upon corporate governance in case organisations. Those factors include the role of the Chief Executive Officer; the quest for competitive advantage; implementation of governance maintenance strategies and the impact of religion for religious-based organisations. Finally, the research also identifies three factors that were not determinative upon case organisations. They are the size of the organisation, the governance model being used, and the influence of the regulator (the Business Affairs Office) and the funding provider (the Department of Health and Human Services). Consequently it is concluded that the principle based approach to corporate governance can be extended to Tasmania. Furthermore the implication of this research for community sector organisations is that they need to implement governance maintenance practices including board training, board performance review and governance review. There is also a call to both the Business Affairs Office and the Department of Health and Human Services to be more proactive in requiring community service organisations to adopt additional corporate governance practices. Hence, based on the literature review and the analysis of the research data, a list of &#8220;Best practice features and practices guiding community service organisation governance&#8221; has been developed. This list can be used by organisations to provide direction for their approach to corporate governance. Finally, the conclusions provide a solid foundation for further study. This will be useful in order to obtain a broader understanding of the issues involved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">best practice</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">community sector organisations</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Third Sector</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Health and Medical Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge asset management: the strategic management and knowledge management nexus</field><field name="creator">James, Paul</field><field name="description">This research sought to establish the nexus between the two management disciplines of strategic management and knowledge management. Through a study of the life cycle of knowledge assets within the Australian Public Sector, this nexus has been established. Over the last three decades, there has been a growing interest in the nascent discipline of knowledge management (Wiig 1997). However, discussion regarding knowledge, knowledge workers and knowledge management started much earlier when Chester Barnard&#8217;s management classic The Functions of the Executive (1938) included suggestions made on how to manage knowledge workers. The 1960s saw management authors and researchers such as Peter Drucker (1993; 1994; 1995; 1997a; 1997b), Machlup (1962), and Michael Polanyi (1967) discussing topics such as knowledge work, knowledge workers, and tacit and explicit knowledge. During much the same period, strategic management was also being researched and discussed, with Alfred D. Chandler being among the first scholars to study strategic management. His book Strategy and Structure (1962) described the development of organisations, and showed that the practice of strategic management predated its study as a management discipline. Chandler was followed by other researchers including Igor Ansoff (1965) and Learned, Christensen, Andrews and Guth (1965), Henry Mintzberg (1979; 1985; 1990; 1996a; 1996b; 1999), and Michael E. Porter (1980; 1985). Research continues in both disciplines; however, research on the interface between these two important disciplines is rare, particularly in Australia.The Australian Public Sector was selected as the target industry for this research, and case study as the research strategy. The research strategy combined a variety of methods including interviews, questionnaires and surveys. The approach taken with data analysis was to employ aspects of the approach used in grounded theory. In addition, action research was used as a meta-methodology, in that periods of review and reflection were undertaken that generated improvements to the research methodology. This research has found that there is a marked interdependence between strategic management and the management of knowledge assets. The strategic management process requires skills and capabilities (knowledge assets) for its execution. Moreover, the resultant strategies require the exploitation of knowledge assets to ensure effective implementation. The life cycle of knowledge assets starts and ends when their need or otherwise is identified directly or indirectly by strategic plans. Knowledge assets are acquired, deployed, utilised and maintained until they are no longer needed. They are then disposed of by outsourcing or atrophy when people are redeployed or retrained. This research has focused on the disciplines of strategic management and knowledge management; however, its contribution lies largely in the area of capability management. Corporate strategy theorists, from the RBV (Resource Based View) and KBV (Knowledge Based View) schools, see organisations as a body of knowledge (Spender 1996). From the perspective of knowledge assets, used as the theme of this research, an organisation is a body of capabilities, and to achieve corporate objectives, the capabilities must match the strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">strategic management</field><field name="subject">knowledge assets</field><field name="subject">resource based view</field><field name="subject">knowledge based view</field><field name="subject">view of the firm</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/25</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of business/management education, to small enterprise solvency</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Peter</field><field name="description">The aim of the research thesis was to identify whether or not the delivery of management education at base level, made a significant contribution to small enterprise solvency. Research by Williams (1986) indicated that over 60% of insolvent small enterprise (SE) owners gave one reason for insolvency as: &#8216;a lack of business/management experience or skill&#8217;. This implies that a significant percentage of SE insolvencies were avoidable, had the SE owner/managers acquired further business skill, knowledge or support. Literature suggests that increased business/management competencies may enable management blind spots within the internal activity structure of some enterprises, to be brought into focus and so controlled (Williams, 1984). This thesis undertakes research, to identify the contribution of various management education programs to SE solvency. The methodology used to test this contribution to business management knowledge, comprised surveys of management education facilitators and program participants, by education institutions from Government and private Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and Government and private non-RTOs. The objective was to determine, through the use of quantitative surveys, if a significant difference could be established between educational facilities offered and small enterprise owner/manager requirements, with the intention to make this an initial exploratory research. The thesis examined perceptions of SE owner/managers participating in management education programs and whether there is a contribution to the solvency of businesses from an educational framework that gives SE owners who lack crucial business/management skills, direction towards specific information, knowledge and abilities. The intention was to bridge research gaps concerning levels of SE solvency and skill-education available using four major types of business educational organisations. The study included interviews with SE owner/managers participating in business programs to identify their perception of the contribution by courses to the solvency of their enterprises. The research examined whether there was a significant difference in certain clusters and competencies between researched management programs, to establish if completing any program affected positively, levels of SE solvency. Since the research focus was on the impacts of management education on SE solvency, another outcome was to profile the participants who reported positive and negative perceptions of the impact of SE management education courses on SE solvency. These results are documented in full in Appendix &#8216;C&#8217;.  Positive perceptions The group of participants, that generally saw courses as having positive affects on SE solvency, had the following characteristics.  Predominantly male with education levels above high school level up to VET registered certificate, aged between 26-47 years, wishing to build their solvency and management skills, and wanting to focus on assistance from mentors/consultants on goals and business plans.  Negative perceptions Course participants who perceived negative attitudes to the impact of courses in SE solvency had characteristics below. Predominantly female with primary school or trade qualifications, bur not VET certified, up to 25 years old or between the ages of 48 and 55 years, and not interested in building business or management skills. The courses they attended did not focus on goal setting and the participants had little interest in working with mentors or consultants. Conclusion The body of knowledge relating to SE solvency was extended as a result of this study, through working directly with management course participants. This research concludes by advancing the theory that education of business owner/managers is not solely to be focussed on management competencies. A complete business education should include character development and business activity planning, as well as business/management competencies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business management education solvency</field><field name="subject">education solvency</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cash flows and accrual accounting in predicting future cash flows of Thai listed companies</field><field name="creator">Chotkunakitti, Porntip</field><field name="description">Cash flow prediction is involved in a number of economic decisions, particularly in investment. Previous research conducted in the United States has provided inconsistency in the results of investigating accounting data, cash flow and accrual accounting data in predicting future cash flows. No published research has studied cash flow prediction in Thailand. The current study investigates the ability of accrual and cash flows accounting data to predict future cash flows of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, cash flows, accrual components and cash flows models. In addition, cash flow ratios are investigated to predict future cash flows by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. Cash flow data are selected directly from the cash flow statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, cash flows, cash flow and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future cash flows of Thai listed companies and cash flows have better predictive power than past earnings. Additionally, the cash flow model and the cash flow and accrual components of earnings model have better predictive power than the earnings model. The findings of testing the models in an out-of-sample period suggest that the cash flow model is a better predictor of future cash flows than the other models. Furthermore, additional year lags of accounting data can improve the predictive power of the model. However, the results indicate that cash flow ratios are not a good predictor of future cash flows. In addition, this study finds that the Asian economic crisis had an impact on the predictive power of accounting data.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cash flow prediction</field><field name="subject">cash flow</field><field name="subject">accrual</field><field name="subject">earnings</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complex adaptive systems and organisational understanding in the Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="creator">Brown, Callum Soutar</field><field name="description">The dissertation contends that an instrument developed through using a model of complex adaptive systems as a generative metaphor will assist members of an organisation to better understand their organisation.  Using an action research methodology, six Air Force Management Services Teams were exposed to six overlapping attributes of complex adaptive systems through focus group workshops with an aim to determine whether they, as experienced management consulting practitioners, saw value to themselves and their Air Force clients of using aspects of complex adaptive systems for organisational understanding.  The overlapping attributes of complex adaptive systems were distilled from the literature reviewed.  Whereas the focus group workshop participants found the attributes valuable in understanding the dynamics of organisational behaviour, they found the new way of thinking challenging on a number of different perspectives.  Some aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its high levels of organisational experience, will make the introduction to and use of complex adaptive systems thinking simpler, while other aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its sensitivity to complex adaptive systems terminology, will make the introduction and use of complex adaptive systems more challenging.  Notwithstanding the challenges, both the complex adaptive systems model, and the use of action research were found to be useful ways of introducing organisations to complex adaptive systems thinking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CAS</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">metaphor</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The policies and procedures for governance and administration that non-government schools in Queensland could use to achieve and maintain accreditation under the Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001</field><field name="creator">Austen, Steven Roy</field><field name="description">Non-government schools in Queensland must be accredited by the Non-State Schools Accreditation Board established by the Queensland Government under the Education(Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001 in order to operate the school.In 2005, there were 457 non-government schools registered in Queensland with the Non-State Schools Accreditation Board (Non-State Schools Accreditation Board 2005). The enrolment of 207,859 students constituted approximately 30 per cent of student enrolments in the State. Government funding to non-government schools is substantial  (general recurrent funding of $303 million was provided by the Queensland government in 2002) (Non-State Schools Accreditation Board 2005).The accreditation criteria set out in the Act are: the school&#8217;s administration and governance arrangements; the school&#8217;s financial viability; the school&#8217;s educational program and student welfare processes; the school&#8217;s resources; and the school&#8217;s improvement processes. The Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Regulation 2001 provides further details on the requirements of the accreditation for all criteria, except for governance and administration criterion. This is the major gap addressed by this research.The methodology for doing so was:&#8226; a theoretical framework for effective corporate governance developed from the relevant literature&#8226; case studies of six non-government schools with a range of ownership/governance models to identify their current governance policies and practices and to compare them with the theoretical framework to assess their effectiveness&#8226; a suite of policies and procedures based on the theoretical framework and &#8220;standout&#8221; practice from the six case study schools that would provide an effective corporate governance practice for non-government schools.The potential clients of this research are:&#8226; The Office of Non-State Education&#8226; Independent Schools Queensland (&#8220;ISQ&#8221;)&#8226; Auspicing denomination or other ownership group of schools, their governing bodies and the auditors of non-government schools; including, but not only, the case study schools&#8226; Newly accredited schools wishing to start well.

The aim of this study is to gain further understanding of the process of sulfide oxidation in ASS materials, which will allow improved and more effective management strategies to be applied to these materials. The process of sulfide oxidation was examined using laboratory incubation experiments. The oxidation of pyrite was the primary cause of initial acidification of the ASS materials studied. Although the acid volatile sulfur fraction increased in concentration by an order of magnitude over the initial 8 days of incubation, the subsequent oxidation of this fraction did not result in substantial acidification. Sulfate (SO42-) was the dominant sulfur species produced from sulfide oxidation, however, water-soluble SO42- was a poor indicator of the extent of sulfide oxidation. The sulfoxyanion intermediates thiosulfate (S2O32-) and tetrathionate(S4O62-) were only detected in the early stages of incubation, and their relative abundance appeared to be pH dependent. The diminishing presence of these 2 sulfur species as oxidation progressed was indicative that ferric iron (Fe3+) and bacterial catalysis were driving the oxidation processes. The rate of sulfide oxidation, and consequent rate of acidification, was highly dependent on the soil pH and oxygen availability. Accelerated sulfide oxidation was only observed at low pH (i.e. pH &lt; 4.0) when oxygen availability was not limited. The application of sub-optimal amounts of neutralising agents prevented severe soil acidification in the short-term (i.e. up to 2 months), but had little effect on decreasing the rate of sulfide oxidation and acidification in the long-term. Sub-optimal amounts of CaCO3 accelerated sulfide oxidation and acidification of the peaty marcasitic ASS material resulting in elevated soluble Fe and Al concentrations. For some of the ASS materials, sub-optimal applications of seawater-neutralised bauxite refinery residue (SNBRR) also resulted in elevated soluble Al concentrations. The response of partially-oxidised ASS materials to the exclusion of oxygen was variable. The rate of sulfide oxidation, acidification and the production of soluble oxidation products generally decreased markedly when subjected to anoxia. However, especially in highly acidic ASS materials (i.e. pH &lt; 3.5), sulfide oxidation and acidification generally occurred (albeit at much slower rates), most probably due to oxidation by Fe3+. Rapid sulfide re-formation occurred in the peat ASS material that had been oxidised for 63 days, with 0.47% reduced inorganic sulfur (SCR) formed over 60 days of anoxia. Biogeochemical sulfide formation consumes acidity, however, sulfide re-formation was ineffective in reversing acidification under the conditions of this experiment. The peroxide oxidation methods examined were method dependent and substantially underestimated peroxide oxidisable sulfur, sulfidic acidity and net acidity. The precipitation of jarosite during peroxide oxidation was a major factor contributing to the underestimation in these ASS materials. Clay mineral dissolution may contribute towards the underestimation of both sulfidic and net acidity using peroxide oxidation methods. The atmospheric loss of sulfur and acidity was also identified as a possible additional interference. This study has shown that the initial pH of an ASS material is a useful indicator (additional to those already used) of the potential environmental hazard of an ASS material when oxygen is expected to be non-limiting, such as when ASS materials are excavated and stockpiled. The recommended action criteria need to be reassessed as the data indicate that the current criteria are conservative for alkaline and neutral ASS materials, but should be lowered for all acidic ASS materials (i.e. pH &lt; 5.5) to 0.03% sulfide regardless of texture. Alternative strategies are necessary for the management of ASS materials that are subject to oxidation when the addition of optimal rates of neutralising materials cannot be ensured. The treatment of sites containing actual ASS materials by management strategies that rely on oxygen exclusion need to be accompanied by strategies that include either acid neutralisation or containment in order to reduce acid export from the site. The peroxide oxidation methods examined were subject to substantial interferences, and consequently are unable to reliably provide accurate measurements of the reduced inorganic sulfur fraction, sulfidic acidity, and net acidity in ASS materials.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyrite oxidation</field><field name="subject">acidification</field><field name="subject">chromium reducible sulfur</field><field name="subject">soil incubation</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">pyritere-formation</field><field name="subject">peroxide oxidation</field><field name="subject">jarosite</field><field name="subject">acid-base accounting</field><field name="subject">acid neutralsing capacity</field><field name="subject">environmental hazard</field><field name="subject">bauxite refinery residue</field><field name="subject">anoxia</field><field name="subject">acidity</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How and why credibility-based company logos are effective in marketing communication in persuading customers to take action: a multiple case study toward a better understanding of creativity in branding</field><field name="creator">Haig, William</field><field name="description">This thesis continues to explore guidelines for logo designers to more effectively plan and create company logos. Also, how the current low trust in company Web Sites can be improved with the company logo. Credibility-based logo design is introduced as the underlying principle for both logo design and Web Site improvement. As such, this thesis explores the application of source credibility studies in communication persuasion to the planning and creative development of company logos. Credibility-based logo design theory is developed in a multiple case study which includes applying credibility-based logo design to improve the effectiveness of company Web Sites. The study has two stages. The inductive stage of this case study develops the credibility-based logo design theory, including actual development of company logos based on this theory. The deductive stage tests credibility-based logo design using the Internet and Web analytics for data collection. The research accomplishes two purposes: 1.     To validate credibility-based logo design theory for marketing communication persuasion effectiveness. 2.     To validate that credibility-based logo design will increase the effectiveness of company Web Sites by giving the visitor trust and confidence in the company to take desired action toward a purchase decision. The case study results support the hypothesis that credibility-based logo design theory can be applied to creating more effective company logo design. And, company Web Sites with a credibility-based logo design are twice to four times more effective compared to Web Sites with a non-credible logo. &#8216;More effective&#8217; means more clickthrough action on the Web Site navigation bar to achieve various company goals, most often a purchase decision. In summary, there are two major contributions: 1.      Advancing the knowledge of company logo design through effective logo planning and design creativity based on source-credibility principles. 2.      Advancing the knowledge of Web Site effectiveness through a company credibility-based logo design. A third contribution is in advancing the knowledge for using the Internet to conduct &#8216;live action&#8217; research and data collection. This has further implications for testing Internet advertising and other visual on-line and off-line marketing elements. The results of this study are important for logo designers, company managers, and Web Site designers. As an epilogue, this thesis extends the credibility basis for creating logos to creating all marketing communication to achieve a total brand personality as credible for a given company. This is termed Brand Credibility with implications for a better measurement of brand equity. This thesis builds on the important logo design work by Pamela Henderson, Joseph Cote and Jim Hutton; and the important branding work of David Aaker, Kevin Lane Keller, Jennifer Aaker, and Tulin Erdem.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertising and Promotion Management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of shifts in strategic orthodoxy on international enterprise performance</field><field name="creator">Lim, Kwee Nan</field><field name="description">This deductive-hypothetico research addressed a literature void on the research problem: Impact of Shifts in Strategic Othodoxy on International Enterprise Performance. This study hypothesised: H11: Strategic orientation correlates with superior international performance; H12: Global strategy contributes to superior performance internationally; and, H13: Skills in strategy execution lead to superiior performance internationally. Three hundred and nine variables in three hypotheses were tested with data collected from a 'small,' but highly relevant sample. Ninety-two variables were positively correlated while 217 were negative. Due to the large number of variables for each hypothesis, no hypothesis was fully supported or rejected. Eleven models for superior international performance have been scientifically developed from data analyses. Models are designed to aid robust international franchising stategy development by strategists at varying continuum of international expertise. Significant serendipitous findings include: nullification of conventional wisdom that the larger the sample size, the higher the reliability the research findings; lateral instead of dedicated strategies can be more effective, in this instance, marketing strategy had no positive correlation with dependent marketing variables but correlated positively with financial variables; and, cost of Australian international franchising operations was determined. A cross sectional research in 2007 will degrade with passage of time. Environmental dynamics will affect its relevance. This study concerns Australian international franchisors, hence generalizability outside this dimension may not be appropriate. Contribution of this research to knowledge is significant: outcomes filled a literature void in relation to the research problem; findings of positively correlated variables help franchising strategists develop strategies that achieve superior performance, whereas negatively correlated variables help avoid costly mistakes; and, the research refuted previous postulations that fundamentals of western management were flawed. Culminating from this research, a window of opportunities has been created for further research in various areas such as varying types or research; methodologies; sectoral and geographical variations; and changes in research scope and width.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">international franchising</field><field name="subject">unorthodox orientation</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of a critical realist perspective in education</field><field name="creator">Shipway, Brad</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the implications of a critical realist perspective for the field of education. Areas of consonance and divergence between two traditions of critical realism which have previously not referenced each other are outlined. It is argued that both theological critical realism and &#8220;Bhaskarian&#8221; critical realism are consonant in terms of their base tenets, and support the concept of a postfoundational, dialectical, stratified and alethic model of truth.The implications of this model and the potential of other critical realist doctrines for education are then examined. It is argued that the combination of critical realism&#8217;s epistemological relativism and ontological realism allows it to steer a course between the extremes of other dominant positions, which are ultimately susceptible to either the foundationalism of positivism, or the regression of idealism.It is suggested that critical realism is uniquely positioned to provide an antidote to the problems besetting contemporary educational research &#8211; especially in instances where modern and postmodern influences are involved in a recalcitrant, self-sustaining conflict. The postfoundationalist doctrines of critical realism enable it to appropriate deconstructionist research methods, but deploy them from within a realist framework. The implications of a critical realist perspective also go beyond educational research, indicating a conception of education as an emancipatory enterprise. By virtue of its evolutionary, stratified model of human rationality, critical realism raises significant challenges to dominant views of pedagogy and praxis in education. Given its concern with absenting constraints upon human freedom, it is claimed that critical realism reveals the real task of education as facilitating the emergent rationality of students towards emancipation. In light of this emancipatory mission, the possible contribution of critical realism to the field of education is too significant to ignore.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical realism</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">theological critical realism</field><field name="subject">dialectical critical realism</field><field name="subject">educational research</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polydora and Dipolydora (Polychaeta: Spionidae) of estuaries and bays of subtropical eastern Australia: A review and morphometric investigation of their taxonomy and distribution</field><field name="creator">Walker, Lexie Margaret</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to review the current state of knowledge, occurrence and distribution of two polydorid (Polychaeta: Spionidae) genera, Polydora and Dipolydora, in estuaries of subtropical eastern Australia. The existing taxonomy of the polydorid group is confused and descriptions include many relative terms. A numerical taxonomy approach using Primer 6 was taken to identify species groups and characters. A standardized set of multivariate morphological characters was developed and resemblance analysis functions used to create species cluster groups. SIMPER (similarity percentages) analysis on the same dataset was used to identify the diagnostic characters for each of these species cluster groups and to identify new characters which could be useful in species diagnosis, particularly for frequently occurring incomplete specimens.Prior to this study 3 Polydora species and 4 Dipolydora species were recorded from subtropical eastern Australia. The present study found 12 Polydora species and 10 Dipolydora species from estuaries and bays of subtropical eastern Australia.Two Polydora species are new (Polydora sp. P1 and Polydora cf. woodwicki) and 7 are potentially new species (P. cf. latispinosa; P. cf. websteri; P. sp. P2S; P. sp. P3S; P. sp. P4S; P. sp. P5S and P. sp. P6S) having been described from single specimens. Polydora cornuta Bosc, 1902 is recorded from New South Wales for the first time. Polydora cf. calcarea is reported from mudblisters in oysters. The Australian form of Polydora hoplura Clapar&#232;de, 1870 and P. haswelli Blake and Kudenov, 1978 are described more fully than in existing literature.Three Dipolydora species are new (Dipolydora sp.

This study reports 6 species of Dipolydora and 5 species of Polydora from this bioregion.Dipolydora penicillata (Hutchings and Rainer, 1979) and Carazziella victoriensis Blake and Kudenov, 1978 are recommended for synonymy.It is recommended that Polydora ciliata (Johnston, 1838) be reinstated and Dipolydora ciliata (Johnson, 1838) removed from the Australian polychaete checklist following identification of an error in description translation.Important gaps in collections were identified for polydorids associated with oysters from estuaries over the whole subtropical region; and for polydorids from the Tweed-Moreton IMCRA bioregion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spionidae</field><field name="subject">polydorid</field><field name="subject">subtropical</field><field name="subject">numerical taxonomy</field><field name="subject">polychaete</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/92</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcultural teachers: experiences of academics teaching tourism and hospitality in multicultural and transnational contexts</field><field name="creator">Witsel, Mieke</field><field name="description">The rapid growth in internationalisation of education has led to the point where Australia has become a world leader in transnational education. Simultaneously, the provision of hospitality and tourism management education has developed rapidly from its inception in 1974 with numbers of international students rising steadily. Although robust research into the international student experience has been conducted, the impact of these changes upon tertiary academics has received little attention from researchers.  Within this context, this research project aims to develop a better understanding of academics&#8217; experiences of teaching tourism and hospitality in transcultural settings. More specifically, the study seeks to discover the impacts of working in a multicultural, multinational and multilingual environment on the tourism and hospitality academic (Objective One), and to explore the concept of competence in multicultural and transnational teaching (Objective Two). This thesis is presented in five stages. The first stage considers the formative background to the research, and explores literature and concepts surrounding transcultural contexts of higher education. The current state of internationalisation of tourism and hospitality higher education in Australia is outlined, and gaps in the research field are highlighted. This section observes a need for transcultural competence in teaching. Stage Two addresses methodological considerations and explores the use of interpretive phenomenological methodology for gaining a greater understanding of the lived experiences of academics teaching in transcultural contexts. The practice and philosophies surrounding phenomenology, interviewing, and transcribing talk are critically examined. This stage also proposes the use of mind mapping as a tool for qualitative research analysis. Employing the interpretive methodologies outlined in the previous stage, Stage Three considers Objective One by addressing the research question &#8216;What are the concerns and constraints experienced by academics teaching in transnational and multicultural contexts?&#8217; In keeping with a phenomenological approach which encourages testing initial intuitions by subjecting them to critical evaluation, this section incorporates a peer-reviewed paper written by the researcher. Findings showed that academics experienced concerns and constraints relating to their sense of self, the intercultural other (the students) and the temporal and education environment in which they are situated. Stage Three also addresses the second research question, &#8216;What influences the positive experiences of academics teaching in transnational and multicultural contexts?&#8217; Findings showed that travel and journeying (both physical and metaphorical) were highly significant, beneficial, and contributed greatly to emotional well-being as they allowed the academics to experience joy in transcultural teaching. Stage Four addresses the second research objective and incorporates two research questions. The question &#8216;How are academics&#8217; intercultural competences in multicultural education formed?&#8217; involved the theoretical delineation of the specific research area through an in-depth systematic literature review in order to develop a holistic explanatory model. The model considers epistemology and ontology of teaching practice, and contains four quadrants: self-knowledge, values, knowledge and skills. The final research question, &#8216;How do successful international tourism and hospitality educators embody and integrate competence in their teaching within multicultural and transnational classrooms?&#8217; entailed close phenomenological analysis of the narrated experiences of four academics who had not only derived much enjoyment from their transcultural teaching, but had been publicly recognised by peers and by their universities as being successful teachers. The narrated experiences, approaches and opinions of these academics are analysed and organised according to the model and are explored under the headings Epistemology &#8211; which includes &#8216;cultural knowledge&#8217; and &#8216;skills&#8217;; and Ontology, which covers &#8216;values&#8217; and &#8216;self&#8217;.  Stage Five considers the implications and significance of this research for higher education. The thesis contributes not only to research into teaching and internationalisation of education, but also makes original contributions to qualitative research methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">competence</field><field name="subject">tourism education</field><field name="subject">hospitality education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">International and Intercultural Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwife to Gaia, birthing global consciousness: a reflective topical autobiography</field><field name="creator">Myers, Estelle</field><field name="description">This Reflective Topical Autobiography (RTA) aimed to reflect on and recount my own actual life stories and the life lessons learned, in order to identify patterns, trends and insights from my life and to offer these insights to others. My objectives were to promote personal empowerment as a tool for fulfilling individual potential, and to heal and be healed, by taking personal responsibility and making choices that enhance the individual and thus the collective consciousness.The research questions I posed to myself to assist in reflecting on and recounting my life stories were: What are the key stories of my life? What life lessons have I learned from my experiences? What are the patterns, trends and insights from my life? How can I offer these insights to other people? The RTA activities included writing personal stories, reflecting on my life patterns, trends and insights, and using photographs and a DVD production, to illustrate the main ideas and events.The research process allowed me to move from being reactive to reflective and to answer the research questions. Some of my life lessons learned from my experiences are that: one person can make a difference; lack of money is not lack of personal power; and nothing is impossible. My life patterns and trends include having a high-energy lifestyle, living without fear, learning to deal with disappointments, keeping life records, taking responsibility for action, and creating a morphic field. This RTA also offers insights to other people, with whom they resonate.It became apparent to me, in the process of documenting my personal journey in this RTA, that by suspending judgement and keeping an open mind and open heart, I am able to attune to what I call &#8216;Divine Intelligence&#8217;. It is a deep cellular knowing, that we are all connected. In 32 years of my own development, I have witnessed quantum leaps in the disciplines of science, spirit, ancient wisdom and health, which are acknowledged in the academies of the world. There is a new way of seeing and thinking, which is about a future based on these holistic principles of interconnectedness. It is the contention of this RTA that thoughts and intentions are the tools for personal and global change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participatory development: methods, skills and processes; a design framed action research thesis</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Martin</field><field name="description">The research question that forms the body of this thesis is: &#8216;What methods, skills and processes does the participatory development practitioner require for effective practice?&#8217;The intention behind this research topic has been to identify how to create socially relevant spaces within todays contemporary conditions of society. This is a reflection of an understanding of myself as someone within the &#8216;idealist&#8217; stream of endeavour as defined by Charles Jencks in &#8216;Modern Movements in Architecture.&#8217;As I have a design background, I chose a design methodology to undertake the study. The methodology is documented by Donald Sch&#246;n in the book &#8216;The Reflective Practitioner&#8217; and is, in a general sense, also the methodology David Kolb documented in &#8216;Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development&#8217;. An element of this learning approach is for a designer to create a useful artefact that can be considered and evaluated, thus the thesis also comprises the DVD: &#8216;Outside the Gates, Development Processes for the Real World&#8217;.In writing the thesis I became aware that this learning process has been, and still is, central to development itself within our culture of generative change. I first arrived at this intuitively while building the DVD, but it became more explicit during the DVD evaluation. The thesis thus commences with a description and rationale for the methodology.After describing the methodology I devote three chapters to providing the background to both the form and content of the DVD. This draws almost exclusively from personal experience, though with references to architectural history, theory and practice. This includes observations on the theme of technological development, generative change and one of the real needs for our physical and psychological well being - shelter. Thus the DVD sits at a mid point in the thesis. Following the creation of the DVD, I have in accordance with the methodology evaluated its content. To do this I used a literature review generally based on Grounded Theory practice. There are four sections in the DVD, with a chapter dedicated to each of these sections.The thesis concludes with a chapter that fits in the final part of Kolb&#8217;s learning cycle, abstract conceptualisation, that considers the meaning of the findings. Ultimately there is an epilogue that outlines the next &#8216;concrete output&#8217;, a recently completed project based on the learnings from the thesis. This is a community engagement training course for project managers.[To view the content of the DVD: Outside the gates go to http://www.martinbutcher.com/Site/OtG.html]</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">paticipation</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">stakeholder</field><field name="subject">group</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">choice</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth of eucalyptus pellita in mixed species and monoculture plantations</field><field name="creator">Bristow, Mila</field><field name="description">Eucalyptus pellita is a commercially important plantation hardwood species for the humid tropics of north Queensland. This species is favoured by both small-scale growers for use in mixed species woodlots targeting low-volume high-value sawn timber, and also by industrial forest companies growing monocultures for integrated pulp &#8211; sawn timber regimes. This study investigated whether mixed-species designs can increase the growth of this tropical eucalypt when compared to monocultures.A replacement series experiment with monocultures of Eucalyptus pellita (E) and Acacia peregrina (A) and mixtures in various proportions (75E:25A, 50E:50A, 25E:75A) was used to examine questions about growth and productivity. The trial was located on the Atherton Tablelands of north Queensland, Australia. High mortality in the establishment phase due to repeated damage by tropical cyclones altered the trial design. Effects of experimental designs on tree growth were estimated using a linear mixed effects model with restricted maximum likelihood analysis (REML). Volume growth of individual eucalypt trees were positively affected by the presence of acacia trees at age five years and this effect generally increased with time up to age 10 years. However, the stand volume and basal area increased with increasing proportions of E. pellita, due to its larger individual tree size. Conventional analysis did not offer convincing support for mixed-species designs. Preliminary individual-based modelling using a modified Hegyi competition index offered a solution and an equation that indicates acacias have positive ecological interactions (facilitation or competitive reduction), and definitely do not cause competition like E. pellita. These results suggest that significantly increased growth rates could be achieved with mixed-species designs over E. pellita monocultures. This statistical methodology could enable a better 4 understanding of species interactions in similarly altered experiments, or undesigned mixed-species plantations.The effects of trees on soils are highly variable and highly site and species specific. That trees can change soil chemistry over time is well established. The soil chemical properties under the eucalypt: acacia experiment were compared to several potential baseline data sources: the reference description of this soil type; those measured at 7 months after planting; and with those of soils under two adjacent vegetation types (forest and pasture) when the experiment was aged 9 years. At 9 years after planting soil total nitrogen increased with increasing proportion of acacias in the treatment. The mean total N under the acacia monoculture was significantly higher (P = 0.041) than that of either the eucalypt monoculture, or the surrounding pasture. The proportion of acacia in the treatment was positively linearly correlated with soil total N (r2 = 0.46; P = 0.018). Soils under the eucalypt monocultures were more similar to those under pasture for a range of soil chemical properties, compared with soils under treatments containing acacias. Results from this site show that the two species alter the soil chemistry in different ways. It is possible that the increased total N under the acacias could be facilitating the growth of the E. pellita, however without n-fixation analysis or tissue sampling it is not possible to confirm that the eucalypt is using the N. Similar cause and effect (or &#8216;supply and use&#8217;) questions also remain for soil pH and available phosphorus changes with increasing acacia in treatment. This study also demonstrates the difficulty in monitoring changes in soil properties over long cycles of forest plantations.The photosynthetic response to light was assessed in the stratified canopy of the mixed species field trial of the eucalypt: acacia experiment, and among commonly planted taxa of E. pellita in glasshouse pot trials. In the field trial photosynthetic capacity of fully5 expanded sun and shade leaves of both species was measured. E. pellita has a wide natural distribution with considerable variation in morphology and growth within the species, with several provenances commonly planted in north Queensland. Photosynthetic capacity and leaf nutrient content of three of these taxa (two from northern occurrences and one from southern occurrences of E. pellita) were measured on two occasions in glasshouse pot trials. A non rectangular hyperbolic function was used to describe the light response curves, and analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the biologically relevant curve parameters between treatments. In the field trial sun and shade leaves of E. pellita produced similar light saturated photosynthetic rates, and experienced little competition for light from the acacia crowns. In contrast there was significant variation in the photosynthetic response between acacia sun and shade leaves. In the glasshouse trials, differences in leaf and petiole morphology were observed, which were coupled with differences in leaf nutrient content and highly significant variation in light saturated photosynthetic rate between the three taxa. This study characterised the light response of E. pellita and suggests that differences in physiological responses to resource availability should be expected among taxa within this species, which may be important for forest productivity models which endeavour to predict tree growth and resource use.An empirical model of growth of E. pellita from a designed monocultures vs. mixedspecies experiment has been used to explore system behaviour rather than predict production of this species from specific forests. This approach has allowed examination of the effect of plantation design on competition, soil nutrient pool change with time and physiological responses to light; leading to a greater understanding of why mixtures can lead to greater productivity than monocultures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eucalyptus pellita</field><field name="subject">monoculture plantations</field><field name="subject">timber</field><field name="subject">Forest Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The philanthropic contract: building social  capital through corporate social investment</field><field name="creator">Cooke, David</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between profit-making corporations and the not-for-profit sector within Australia. The broad field of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is discussed, narrowing to the activity of corporate philanthropy and corporate social investment. The latter is defined as being philanthropy with strategic intent, in order to build capacity within the recipient organisation which in most cases will produce beneficial outcomes for the donor as well (Tracey, 2003). The title of this study has used the term &#8216;philanthropic contract&#8217; (Broadbent, 2001; Kouzmin, 2007) to describe the relationship between commercial organisations and charitable ones and the unwritten societal expectation, that the corporate sector will support the work of members of the not-for-profit sector. This study also uses the term &#8216;social capital&#8217; (Putnam, 1995) to describe one of the principle areas of benefit for companies who participate.The aspect of the relationship between the two sectors that formed the focus of this study is defined as being the interaction between the two that involves financial contributions and those of goods and services as well as expertise, information and influence flowing from profit-making companies to not-for-profit organisations.The direction of the research is to advance toward an understanding of why corporations engage in this practice and toward a conclusion as to whether corporate social investing is a mutually beneficial exchange. Finally, the study highlights examples of engagement processes, and advice from those participating. The inclusion of these in the study is designed to provide valuable learning for other corporations, and not-for-profit organisations, contemplating entering into their own philanthropic partnerships.Through ten qualitative interviews this inquiry investigated the attitudes toward this relationship of various stakeholders including the management of not-for-profit organisations, representatives of relevant associations and social commentators. It became apparent that the previously well-publicised opposition to publicly listed companies supporting the not-for-profit sector, proffered by organisations such as the Australian Shareholders&#8217; Association, had largely evaporated.Case studies involving five profit-making corporations, operating within Australia, were then undertaken and the views of their senior management sought as regards their motivations, aims, and outcomes. Overwhelmingly their experiences were positive for the corporation, the organisations they were funding, and the members of the community that the recipients were in turn supporting.Corporate benefits reported included increased ability to attract quality staff, enhanced ability to retain staff, significant development for staff that actively participated, improved corporate culture and the building of social capital leading to enhanced reputation which supported the corporations licence to operate, future objectives and long term sustainability.It is hoped that these insights along with the advice offered up by those individuals and organisations that participated in the study will benefit others and promote greater participation in corporate philanthropy and social investment within Australia. vii</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate social responsibility</field><field name="subject">corporate social investment</field><field name="subject">corporate philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strange</field><field name="creator">Prussian, Denny</field><field name="description">Strange is a work of biographical fiction, memoir and critical interpretation divided into three parts: Strange Past, Strange Present and Strange Extrapolations. Strange Past introduces the author&#8217;s ancestors and explores the ways in which they negotiated cultural and location change as new settlers and, later, as mixed-race identities within the dangerously unstable colonial-racial environment of the 19C Swan-River colony. Although the names belonged to real people and the text is based on facts drawn from public records and the author&#8217;s oral family history, the actions and dialogue in Strange Past are fictional. In Strange Present the author introduces himself as memoir subject and, through his perspective as a descendant of the central Strange Past protagonists, the theme of mixed-race cultural negotiation continues within a late Twentieth-Century environment. The memoir also relies on fiction to tell the fundamentally factual stories. Strange Past and Strange Present form the body text. Strange Extrapolations is a critical interpretation of the body text structured around a research focus on cultural, textual and discursive/linguistic hybridity. Informed and supported by post-colonial, post-structural and post-modern discourse on identity and belonging within racial multiplicities, Strange Extrapolations attempts to illuminate the instability of static cultures, ideologies or notions of identity wherever hybridity exists. Indeed, Strange Extrapolations infers that hybridity exists everywhere in an infinite multitude of incarnations and thus remains as a permanently destabilising influence upon every human status quo.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English Language and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/2</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planting the seeds of change and growing the fruits of transdisciplinary educational design</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Meg</field><field name="description">The professional practice of educational design normally involves collaborating with a subject matter expert on a one-to-one basis and is only occasionally undertaken in teams. This thesis argues that a team-based approach to educational design is powerful and particularly so when transdisciplinary collaborations are facilitated. Transdisciplinary educational design is the process of standing outside one&#8217;s discipline to collaborate with colleagues from the technical sphere, the library and other disciplines. The common ground shared by the transdisciplinary teams in this research was student assessment.The core data collection for this research was completed between July 2002 and June 2005. Using an overarching action research methodology, three cycles of data collection were completed by action learning sets. Suitable members of the sets were identified through a series of online staff development workshops that were designed and facilitated by the researcher. Two supplementary data collection activities were also undertaken. The first of these was a Web survey that broadly mapped design practices for online assessment in four Australian regional universities. Three rounds of telephone interviews then followed up on survey responses. The second supplementary data collection was undertaken between the second and third action learning cycles to contextualise the online assessment design activities at Southern Cross University within the broader framework provided by the other three regional universities in the original sample. It included focus groups with educational designers and face-to-face interviews with three academics at each of these universities. The entire series of data collection activities was reflectively managed to heighten its effectiveness. This management included screening of suitable participants, negotiation of manageable session times and duration, and establishment of ground rules for attendance and interactions, as well as drawing out a commitment to observe silences as creative spaces in the design process.In keeping with the action research paradigm, an extensive examination of the literature not only provides a background for the research questions but also continues to be threaded throughout the thesis as data collection cycles directed further literature review. The thesis narrative is given an original form through the use of a gardening metaphor that serves to highlight the rewarding, delicate and transitional nature of this kind of educational design. Such transitional aspects of educational design allow for innovation and creativity not evident in the systems-based approaches to designing instruction. This research also supports current initiatives in Australian higher education concerning the first year experience, embedding graduate attributes in the curriculum, and blending on-campus and off-campus learners into one class.

This thesis describes an investigation into the role of acetylenic and allenic precursors in the formation of the important aroma compound &#946;-damascenone (1).

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the subject, beginning with a brief history of the Australian wine industry which began with the first fleet&#146;s arrival in 1788. Many of the various volatile compounds found in wine are then discussed, with particular
emphasis on &#946;-damascenone (1). Some previous syntheses of 1 are summarised, as well as the in vivo generation of this compound, and also the role of glycoconjugation in nature. The chapter concludes with the aims of the present work.

Chapter 2 covers the synthesis of the suspected acetylenic precursor 9-hydroxymegastigma-3,5-dien-7-yne (36), which was prepared by the addition of 3-butyn-2-ol to 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one, followed by a conjugate
dehydration reaction. The synthetic sample of 36 was shown to be identical to a compound previously observed in the hydrolysate of 3,5,9-trihydroxymegastigma-6,7-diene (31). Upon acid hydrolysis, 36 produced &gt; 90% &#946;-damascenone (1).

Chapter 3 outlines the synthesis and hydrolysis of the C9 glycoside 43, which was prepared by a modified Koenigs-Knorr procedure on aglycone 36.  Diastereomerically pure samples of each of the two possible glycosides were synthesised from corresponding enantiomerically pure samples of 36, which in turn were prepared by the use of either (R) or (S) 3-butyn-2-ol. Detailed hydrolytic studies (at 25 &#186;C) were conducted on both the aglycone and the two glycosides: the half lives of conversion of 36 into 1 were 40 hours and 65 hours at pH 3.0 and pH 3.2
respectively; the (9R) diastereomer of 43 had half-lives of 3 days and 6 days, respectively at the same pH values, whereas the (9S) diastereomer had half lives of 3.5 days and 6.5 days, respectively at the same pH values.  

The synthesis of the other suspected precursor, megastigma-4,6,7-triene-3,9-diol (35) is covered in Chapter 4. This allene was prepared by addition of 3-butyn-2-ol to phorenol, with the allene function generated by reaction with lithium aluminium hydride. By using (3S)-phorenol and both (R) and (S) 3-butyn-2-ol, four different diastereomers of 35 were prepared and characterised. The (3S, 6R, 9S)-isomer of 35 was also found to be identical to a compound previously observed in the hydrolysate of (31).  A detailed hydrolytic study of the four synthetic isomers of 35 is contained within Chapter 5. This study revealed that each of the four isomers underwent rapid epimerisation at 25 &#186;C and pH 3.0. Careful analysis of the four product mixtures by chiral GC-MS revealed that this epimerisation was occurring exclusively at C3. The complete absence of 3-hydroxydamascone (2) from any of the hydrolysates required a re-appraisal of the mechanism of in vivo formation of &#946;-damascenone (1), which forms the focus of the second half of this chapter.  The experimental procedures (materials and methods) for all work covered in
chapters 2-5 are located in Chapter 6.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">beta-damascenone precursors</field><field name="subject">beta-damascenone</field><field name="subject">acetylenic precursors to beta damascenone</field><field name="subject">allenic precursors to beta-damasconone</field><field name="subject">9-hydroxymegastigma-3</field><field name="subject">5-dien-7-yne</field><field name="subject">megastigma-4</field><field name="subject">6</field><field name="subject">7-triene-3</field><field name="subject">9-diol</field><field name="subject">glycoside</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100331.220041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aggregate coalescence and factors affecting it.</field><field name="creator">Hasanah, Uswah</field><field name="description">The phenomenon called soil aggregate coalescence occurs at contact-points between aggregates and causes soil strength to increase to values that can inhibit plant root exploration and thus potential yield. During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to &#8216;weld&#8217; together with little or no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of &#8216;effective stresses&#8217; that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of drainage, penetrometer resistance was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0.3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect &#8220;Brazilian&#8221; crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; this was not the case for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0.49, 1.47 and 2.47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i.d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced &#8211; that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of &lt; 0.5, 0.5 &#8211; 2, 2 &#8211; 4, and &lt; 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores &#8211; being greater in the &lt; 0.5 mm and &lt; 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0.5 &#8211; 2 mm and 2 &#8211; 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil organic matter and irrigation technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy &#8211; that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs with little or no increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of sodicity of each soil was manipulated by varying the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2mm) above and below a nominal threshold value of 6. Dry aggregates were then packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to wetting near saturation, then draining to a suction of 100 kPa for one week as described above. Measurements were then taken of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength, both of which were affected by ESP in different ways. In the coarse-textured soil, sodicity enhanced aggregate slaking and dispersion, which increased bulk density. While penetrometer resistance also increased, its effect on aggregate coalescence could not be separated from a simple effect of increased bulk density. Similarly, the effect of sodicity on aggregate coalescence in the fine-textured soil was confounded by the higher water contents produced by greater swelling, which produced lower-than-expected penetrometer resistance. Measurements of tensile strength were conducted on air-dry samples, and so the confounding effects of bulk density and water content were eliminated and it was found that tensile strength increased with sodicity in both coarse- and fine-textured soils. The presence of dispersed clay was therefore implicated in the development of aggregate coalescence in this work. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of how the early stages of aggregate coalescence might affect plant growth was attempted using tomatoes (Gross lisse) as a test plant. Seeds were planted in aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 4 mm) of a coarse- or fine-textured soil packed in steel rings. These were wetted at a rate of 1 mm/h to either near-saturation (for maximum coalescence) or to a suction of 10 kPa (for minimum coalescence) and held under these conditions for 24 h. All samples were then transferred to a ceramic pressure plate for drainage to 100 kPa suction for one week. Samples were then placed in a growth-cabinet held at 20C with controlled exposure to 14 h light/day. Germination of the seeds, plant height, and number and length of roots were observed. Germination of the seeds held at near-saturation in both coarse- and fine-textured soils was delayed by 24 h compared with seeds held at 10 kPa suction. Neither the number nor the length of tomato roots differed significantly between the different treatments and soils. In the coarse-textured soil, however, the total root length over a period of 14 days was somewhat greater in the uncoalesced samples than in the coalesced samples, but this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that aside from delaying germination, aggregate coalescence may not have a large effect on early growth of tomato plants. However, this is not to say that detrimental effects may not be manifest at later stages of plant growth, and this certainly needs to be evaluated, particularly because aggregate coalescence increase with repeated cycles of wetting and draining. In conclusion, the primary findings of the work undertaken in this thesis were: &#8226; Rapid wetting of soil aggregates to near-saturation enhanced the onset of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by (in some cases) penetrometer resistance at a soil water suction of 100 kPa, and (in most cases) tensile strength of soil cores in the air-dry state. The rate of wetting appeared to be more important in bringing on aggregate coalescence than how wet the soil eventually became during wetting. This means reducing the rate at which irrigation water is applied to soils may reduce the onset of aggregate coalescence more effectively than controlling the total amount of water applied &#8211; though both are important. The literature reports that aggregate coalescence occurs in the field over periods of up to several months, involving multiple wetting and draining cycles, but the work here demonstrated that this can occur over much shorter time periods depending on conditions imposed. &#8226; Aggregate coalescence occurred in coarse-textured soils regardless of whether the bulk density increased during wetting and draining. In finer-textured soils, the response to wetting conditions varied and was complicated by changes in bulk density and water content due to swelling. &#8226; Small overburden pressures enhanced the onset of aggregate coalescence, but these effects were diminished in the presence of high soil organic matter contents. &#8226; Finer aggregate size distributions (which are often produced in the field by excessive tillage during seedbed preparation) invariably led to greater aggregate coalescence than coarser aggregate size distributions. The effects of aggregate size were mitigated to some extent by higher contents of soil organic matter. &#8226; Sodicity enhanced aggregate coalescence as measured by tensile strength, but when penetrometer resistance was measured in the moist state, the effects were masked to some extent by higher water contents generated by swelling and dispersion. This work suggests that tensile strength (in the air dry state) may be a more effective measure of aggregate coalescence than penetrometer resistance. &#8226; Early plant response to aggregate coalescence was not large, but the response may become magnified during later stages of growth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggregate; bulk density; coalescence; matric suction; organic matter; penetrometer resistance; sodicity; tensile strength; water content</field><field name="subject">Soil structure.</field><field name="subject">Soil penetration test.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor receptors in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Brierley, Gemma Victoria</field><field name="description">The IGF system is a crucial regulator of normal growth and development, however dysregulation of the system on multiple levels is associated with the incidence of a wide variety of malignancies including the breast, thyroid, lung, and colon, making the IGF system an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. Due to its role in mediating cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis, traditional focus has been set on examining the role of the type 1 IGF receptor [IGF1R] in cancer. However there is mounting evidence to suggest the insulin receptor [IR] may also be involved in the potentiation and pathogenesis of cancers. The observation that IGF-II is overexpressed, compared to normal tissues, by cancers suggests signaling via target receptors by this ligand has important implications on cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, both the IGF1R and IR have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in a variety of malignancies. In regards to IR isoform, the IGF-II binding IR-A is preferentially expressed by a number of cancer cell types. Together with the observation that an autocrine proliferative loop exists between IGF-II and the IR-A in malignant thyrocytes and cultured breast cancer cells, suggests signaling via the IR-A may play a role in cancer cell growth and survival. However, very few studies on the IR-A have been conducted in cells co-expressing the IGF1R. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with discrimination between signaling arising from IGF1R homodimers, IR-A homodimers, and IGF1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. It is not known how the IR-A interacts, and functions in conjunction with the other receptors of the IGF system to signal biologically relevant outcomes, especially in terms of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to block and down-regulate the IGF1R. Current anti-cancer therapies targeting the IGF system have concentrated on blocking IGF signaling via the IGF1R, due mostly to the functional properties of the receptor, but also in part due to the metabolic consequences associated with blockade and inhibition of the IR. This individual targeting of the IGF1R potentially leaves a pathway by which IGF-II secreted by the tumour can circumvent current IGF1R based therapies. Consequently, this thesis investigated whether the IR-A could compensate for the targeted loss of the IGF1R and how the IR-A interacts with the IGF1R in cells co-expressing these two receptors. In addition, the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation was assessed. The main experimental techniques used throughout this body of work included; assessment of protein expression and activation by Western blot, siRNA mediated gene silencing, and measures of cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The key areas of investigation included: 1. Investigation of the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation 2. Identification of an appropriate cell line model in which to investigate the interactions between the IR-A and IGF1R 3. Optimisation of siRNA mediated knock-down of the IR-A and IGF1R in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells 4. Determination of the biological role of the IR-A in SW480 cells co-expressing the IGF1R The key findings from this work included: 1. The IR-A could not compensate for IGF1R depletion in SW480 cells 2. Dual silencing of the IR-A and IGF1R indicated signaling via the IGF1R was dominant to signaling via the IR-A in SW480 cells 3. Signaling via IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors may not be as potent as signaling via IGF1R homodimers 4. IGF-I at physiological concentrations can stimulate biological responses via both isoforms of the IR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factors; cancer; colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell receptors.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role and impact of services sector on economic growth : an econometric investigation of tourism and air services in Fiji (1968-2006) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Management in Economics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Qasenivalu, Mosese Tavaga</field><field name="description">Empirical studies have established that tourism is a major determinant of economic growth and that international air services have a beneficial effect on the growth and development of an economy. It has also been argued that trade and public enterprise reforms in the service sectors, undertaken to a greater extent in high income countries, have had a positive impact on the sectors performances. This study analyses several hypotheses relating to Fiji&#8217;s tourism and air transport service industries. First the study examines the contribution of tourism exports to economic growth in the case of Fiji. Second, the study analyses whether the tourism reform adopted by Fiji in 1999 under the World Trade Organization&#8217;s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has impacted on total tourism export performance. Third, the aviation-service growth nexus is investigated. Lastly, the effect of the aviation public enterprise reform activities on the export performance of air services is evaluated. Using time series annual data from 1968 to 2006, the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag. methodology has been utilized to estimate the contribution of each service sector to Fiji&#8217;s total service output. The results show that the tourism is a major determinant of growth in Fiji and that the aviation service-growth hypothesis is also valid for Fiji. The empirical results show that both the trade reforms in tourism and the pro-competitive measures undertaken in the airline industry, amongst other determinants, have not significantly created an impact on the respective export performance of tourism and air services. These findings provide key policy implications in the light of capitalizing on services exports as a major source of growth, particularly in developing island countries such as Fiji and the need to facilitate the strengthening of the market to boost the export performance of tourism and air services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism export</field><field name="subject">tourism reform</field><field name="subject">aviation public enterprise</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key success drivers in offshore software development : New Zealand and Indian vendors' perspectives : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Technology at Massey University, Albany campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mathrani, Anuradha</field><field name="description">Offshore software development (OSD) is a leading business sector in the present &#8216;glocal&#8217; IT marketplace, and vendors in different countries are opening software development centres worldwide to take advantage of the new business opportunities. However, software development is both a technical and a social process as various software modules need to be integrated, which requires ongoing interaction between the stakeholders. The software modules rely upon local knowledge regarding customer wants, project specific features, chosen design methodologies by development team members and synchronisation of activities to confirm the next design iteration. This study focuses on knowledge sharing processes involving the interplay between acquiring local knowledge and applying the knowledge acquired into the design of the client-specific software builds. New knowledge is created as new processes are applied and new outcomes realised, resulting in re-definition of software development practices. Building on existing theories with empirical case study evidence, this research reveals the socio-technical influences on knowledge management in the OSD process. Ideographic research methods have been applied to bring sensitivity in the everyday organisational activities for knowledge sharing across diverse social and cultural groups within two country contexts (New Zealand and India). Empirical data from ten case studies is used to inductively develop a conceptual framework, which has been applied to make within case and cross case comparisons across three levels of analysis (micro, meso and macro) for knowledge sharing. The micro level analysis explores individual key success drivers (behaviours and methodologies), the meso level explores organisational level practices (work processes and structures) and the macro level gives a holistic evaluation across two country contexts. Country contexts reveal that New Zealand vendors share closer cultural proximity with their clients, are engaged in client facing skills and have further outsourced software development tasks to other low cost countries. The Indian vendors are involved in software construction, prefer technical specialist skills and have defined more discipline in their software development processes. The thesis offers new insights on how vendors&#8217; shape their software development styles based upon their beliefs and understanding of the offshore market and is especially relevant to both vendors and clients who intend venturing into the offshore market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software localisation</field><field name="subject">knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict.

The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lineage specific evolution and phylogenetic analysis : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomathematics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Grievink, Liat Shavit</field><field name="description">Phylogenetic models generally assume a homogeneous, time reversible, stationary process. These assumptions are often violated by the real, far more complex, evolutionary process. This thesis is centered on non-homogeneous, lineage-specific, properties of molecular sequences. It consist several related but independent studies. LineageSpecificSeqgen, an extension to the Seq-Gen program, which allows generation of sequences with changes in the proportion of variable sites, is introduced. This program is then used in a simulation study showing that changes in the proportion of variable sites can hinder tree estimation accuracy, and that tree reconstruction under the best-fit model chosen using a relative test can result in a wrong tree. In this case, the less commonly used absolute model-fit was a better predictor of tree estimation accuracy. This study found that increased taxon sampling of lineages that have undergone a change in the proportion of variable sites was critical for accurate tree reconstruction and that, in contrast to some earlier findings, the accuracy of maximum parsimony is adversely affected by such changes. This thesis also addresses the well-known long-branch attraction artifact. A nonparametric bootstrap test to identify changes in the substitution process is introduced, validated, and applied to the case of Microsporidia, a highly reduced intracellular parasite. Microsporidia was first thought to be an early branching eukaryote, but is now believed to be sister to, or included within, fungi. Its apparent basal eukaryote position is considered a result of long-branch attraction due to an elevated evolutionary rate in the microsporidian lineage. This study shows that long-branch estimates and basal positioning of Microsporidia both correlate with increased proportions of radical substitutions in the microsporidian lineage. In simulated data, such increased proportions of radical substitutions leads to erroneous long-branch estimates. These results suggest that the long microsporidian branch is likely to be a result of an increased proportion of radical substitutions on that branch, rather than increased evolutionary rate per se. The focus of the last study is the intriguing case of Mesostigma, a fresh water green alga for which contradicting phylogenetic relationships were inferred. While some studies placed Mesostigma within the Streptophyta lineage (which includes land plants), others placed it as the deepest green algae divergence. This basal positioning is regarded as a result of long-branch attraction due to poor taxon sampling. Reinvestigation of a 13- taxon mitochondrial amino acid dataset and a sub-dataset of 8 taxa reveals that site sampling, and in particular the treatment of missing data, is just as important a factor for accurate tree reconstruction as taxon sampling. This study identifies a difficulty in recreating the long-branch attraction observed for the 8-taxon dataset in simulated data. The cause is likely to be the smaller number of amino acid characters per site in simulated data compared to real data, highlighting the fact that there are properties of the evolutionary process that are yet to be accurately modeled.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular sequences</field><field name="subject">tree estimation accuracy</field><field name="subject">Microsporidia</field><field name="subject">long-branch attraction</field><field name="subject">Mesostigma</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mythological state and its empire</field><field name="creator">Grant, David John, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">legitimate because it is not the persistence of a secularised theological concept. Although it reoccupied mirror-image pre-Enlightenment questions, say regarding absolutism, it is not first concerned with such categories as ???sovereignty, raison d???etat, will, decision, friend-enemy??? but with ???contract, consent, liberty, law and rights???. However, in Work on Myth, he proposes that man is, and has always been, a maker of mythological magnitudes, of which there can be argued to be an archetypal form. These magnitudes are so fearsome as to allow man to convert his existential fear into fear of an entity the fate of which he can gradually bring into his own hands. In this way, there is the promise of the elimination of existential fear and of the experience of sympathetic conditions of existence. Blumenberg does not address political issues, such as the nature of the State. However, if the State can be shown to be such a magnitude and therefore a political realisation of such an archetype, then it is mythological and so is not modern, even if it is legitimate. It then needs to be criticised to allow the introduction of a radical notion of Enlightenment. The effect of such criticisms would be the replacement of the notions of fear and sympathy with that of self-responsibility as the first interest of the State. Selfresponsibility would need to be promoted progressively. It would require a reconfigured State the prime purpose of which is the promotion of respect and self-reliance of individuals. Its first concern would therefore not be the elimination of fear, which would be understood as unable to be eliminated, nor the creation by it of sympathetic conditions of existence, which would be better a matter for properly prepared and supported, selfreliant individuals. The debate then would be around this axis, where contingency is accepted and managed, not the mythological axis of liberalism and republicanism which has dominated modern political theory since Hobbes. This thesis is first an exploration of the viability of the mythological idea of the State, whether the State is a political realisation of the archetypal myth. It does this through an examination of such thinkers in the political tradition as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, Rawls and Pettit. The conclusion of this examination is, in sum, that the idea of the State since Hobbes has been, and remains, mythological since it shows all the key characteristics of a mythological entity and the arguments for it have mythological presumptions. It is still first concerned with the fear/sympathy nexus and the debates of the political tradition from Hobbes to Pettit have been carried out around that axis. Further, this is argued to be an arrangement which promotes dominant interests rather than widespread participation of non-autonomous, self-responsible individuals. But if this notion of the State as a progressively refined and dispersed mythological entity is viable, it cannot have existed only in the minds of those in the political theoretical tradition. We should expect to see evidence of it in the beliefs and practices of individual  men and women. It must have been not just a political realisation of the mythological State as an idea, but an embodied notion. This thesis is also an exploration of the evidence for that embodiment. It does this by looking at Elias??? analysis of the civilising process in the Middle Ages, at Foucault???s analysis of the emergence and proliferation of the disciplines and the art of government from the 17th century and at the dispersal of the myth through cultural imperialism in the 18th century. The conclusions of these analyses are reinforced by the social ontology of Wittgenstein. Further argument for this embodiment is presented regarding both the common notion of citizenship and the perception of other cultures, that each manifest mythological characteristics. Such embodied practices can be seen as strategies promoted through the State by dominant interests, the purpose of which are the claims to generally eliminate fear and create sympathetic conditions of existence. This embodiment reinforces the initial argument that the idea of the State did emerge and has been established and gradually refined as mythological. In essence and in large part, this is a genealogy of post-Hobbesian political society as mythological. That is, as the political realisation of the archetypal mythological form and its embodiment in the material practice of individuals. The explanatory value of this way of perceiving the State is then demonstrated by its application to the complex conditions of the destruction of traditional Aboriginal culture by the colonising and civilising British, that is the dispersal of the mythological State as empire. From this, it is argued that the mythological understanding of the State is more illuminating that other approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State, The</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of ???environmental refugee??? protection at the United Nations</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Karen Elizabeth, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to better conceptualise how and why there is an absence of international protection for ???environmental refugees???, and to place these findings in the critical geopolitics literature. A poststructuralist framework, drawing on Foucault???s ideas of discourse, subjectivity, power and governance, was deemed most appropriate for this thesis, and provided a means of differentiation from previous literature on ???environmental refugees???. This thesis develops a genealogy of the subject category of ???environmental refugees??? since the 1970s, to better understand how the United Nations, Inter-Governmental Organisations (IGOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the media have constructed environmental issues and refugees in texts. Fieldwork undertaken in 2004 enabled me to conduct 45 semistructured interviews with United Nations diplomats and representatives from IGOs and NGOs. Critical scrutiny of these interview texts revealed the constructions of ???environmental refugees??? as various subject identities, particularly in relation to climate change. Pacific ambassadors to the United Nations were also interviewed in 2004 to explore how they negotiated discourses on climate change and ???environmental refugees???, and attempted to articulate their concerns at the United Nations. This thesis contends that an absence of policy at the United Nations to protect ???environmental refugees??? has been produced by a combination of discursive and institutional politics. Unequal power structures at the United Nations have limited the capacity of small island states to lobby and articulate concerns, while subject categories of ???environmental refugees??? have been constructed in ways that alter the terms of debate, evade legal response, or deflect blame away from the perpetrators of environmental damage. Reasons for this policy absence have been the shifting attitudes towards environmental issues and the role of multilateral political institutions. The overall contribution of this thesis is to critical geopolitics, through its examination of the role of multilateralism, representations of environmental issues causing population displacement, and how and why policy absences are created within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Protection</field><field name="subject">Refugees -- International cooperation</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">Internally displaced persons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kylie Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the nature and processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present a risk factor for posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that specific retrieval deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that specific retrieval is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to specific retrieval deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared  to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one???s self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues.

It argues firstly that Kant???s ideas of reason, as he originally defines them as regulative in the First Critique, play an important role in his political philosophy and his dynamic approach to politics. Secondly, because it is fundamentally concerned with political transition and improvement, Kant???s approach to politics is therefore one that has continuing relevance. Evidence for this is provided via an examination of Rawls??? political liberalism and the manner in which the idea of the reasonable fulfils the role of an idea of reason. The thesis begins with an examination of the regulative use of ideas of reason in the Dialectic of the First Critique: the ideas of soul, world and God become guides for practice, insofar as they are not bearers of truth but instead create essential conditions necessary for human life and meaning. Chapter Two then demonstrates how ideas of reason figure in Kant???s political texts. They condition politics by inspiring the practice of their objects, for example, the establishment of a rightful condition, the security of private property, the perpetuation of peace. That they look to the status quo in order to effect politics, demonstrates their concern with social progress. Chapter Three argues that publicity forms the primary political idea of reason as it enables the polity to use ideas of reason. Because publicity provides the test of efficient and rightful politics, we can say that it is through publicity that Kant???s politics is grounded. Chapter Four investigates Rawls??? political liberalism and observes that the primacy of the idea of the reasonable in his theory works according to a system of ideas of reason as proposed by Kant. Chapter Five then makes a final comparison between Kant and Rawls to demonstrate that ideas of reason, in particular the pre-eminent political idea of public reason, is central to both their conceptions of the political condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reason.</field><field name="subject">Political science.</field><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An immunologically inspired self-set for sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Bokareva, Tatiana, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), consisting of many small sensing devices working in concert, have the potential to revolutionise every aspect of our lives. Although the technology is still in its infancy offers an unlimited number of possible applications, ranging from military surveillance to environmental monitoring. These WSNs are prone to physical sensor failures due to environmental conditions such bio fouling and an adverse ambient environment, as well as threats that arise from their operation in an open environment. Consequently, reliability and fault-tolerance techniques become a critical aspect of the research associated with WSNs. In mission critical applications, such as the monitoring of enemy troops, unreliable or faulty information produced by WSNs could potentially lead to fatal outcomes. In such applications, it necessary to receive both a correct notification of event occurrences and uncorrupted data. Developing a fault-tolerance system for WSNs is a challenging task. New self-configuration, self-recognition and self-organisation techniques are needed due to unique aspects of the operation of WSNs. Our current understanding of WSNs leads to an immunologically inspired solution to the design of a fault-tolerant network. One of the main roles of the Natural Immune System(NIS) is the recognition of self and the elimination of non-self proteins. Hence, in order to have an immune system equivalent for a sensor network, we must have a clear and stable definition of what constitutes the Self and the Non-Self Sets in a sensor network. This thesis explores two different approaches to modelling, collection and representation of the Self-Set in distributed sensor networks. We approach this problem, of identifying what constitutes the Self-Set in terms of sensor readings, using pattern recognition techniques from the machine learning field that leverages a small number of past observations of sensor nodes. We have chosen Competitive Learning Neural Network (CLNN) for the construction of the Self-Set. We define and evaluate two approaches for the aggregation of the Self-Set across multiple sensors in a WSN. The first approach is the Graph Theory Based Aggregation (GTBA) which consists of two main parts, namely: classification of the sensor readings by means of CLNN, which provides the multimodal view data and GTBA of the CLNN output, which takes intersections of intervals produced by CLNN. In this thesis we define and evaluate two different interpretations of GTBA, namely: Midpoint Intersection (MPI): one that considers the midpoint of intervals. Midpoint Free Intersection (MFI): one that does not take the midpoints into account but assigns the confidence levels to each of the resulted intersections. We evaluated both interpretations on three different types of phenomena and have shown that the second interpretation, MFI, consistently produced more precise representations of the environment under observation. However, MFI produced a very strict representation of the phenomenon, which consequently led to a large number of systems' retraining. Hence, we defined and evaluated a technique which produced a more relaxed representation of the Self-Set and at the same time preserved the finer variation in the phenomenon. The second approach is based on unsupervised learning. We define and evaluate three related unsupervised learning procedures ?? Divergence and Merging (DMP), Suboptimal Clustering (SOC), and Simple Clustering (SC) for the collection of the Self-Set. We explore the design tradeoffs in unsupervised learning schemes with respect to the clustering quality. We implement and evaluate these related unsupervised learning procedures on a realworld data set. The outcome of these experiments show that, out of the three unsupervised learning procedures studied in this thesis, the Suboptimal Clustering procedure appears to be the most suitable for the classification of sensor readings, provided that the amount of free memory is large enough to store and recluster an entire training set. We evaluate aggregation of the Self-Set produced by means of the distributed implementation of the unsupervised learning procedures. The aggregation is based on extended unsupervised learning and we evaluate the possibilities of the autonomous retraining of the system. Our experiments show that, in a naturally slowly changing environment, 40% of nodes reporting deviations is a large enough number to reinitialise the retraining of the system. The final conclusion is that it is possible to have a distributed implementation of the unsupervised procedure that  produces an almost identical representation of the environment, which  makes unsupervised learning suitable for a large number of sensor network architectures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Self-set</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defendants, mental illness and negligence law: a critique</field><field name="creator">Bromberger, Nikki, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">At common law, liability in negligence is based generally on an objective standard of reasonable care. As a consequence of this idea those who possess reduced capacities, as compared to the ordinary reasonable person, may be held to standards which they are incapable of reaching. Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. Children are not required to behave the way reasonable adults behave. Rather, when the defendant is a child, courts take into account the capabilities which are a concomitant of the defendant???s age. A defendant???s mental illness, on the other hand, is not considered by courts in Australia (or elsewhere) to be relevant when determining liability in negligence. It has been argued that in this regard the common law is incoherent and unfair. This thesis considers whether these claims of incoherence and unfairness can be substantiated. In so doing, it considers the philosophical underpinnings of tort law in order to explore possible bases for the current law. It also examines a number of more specific accounts which attempt to justify the present law as it relates to mental illness. It is argued that none of these discussions provide a convincing basis for the different treatment in law between child defendants and defendants with a mental illness. The discussion extends beyond the confines of tort law to criminal law for explanations for the apparent incoherence. It notes the suggestion that the criminal law???s response to defendants with a mental illness has been fuelled to some extent by a misunderstanding of mental illness and a fear of those suffering from such illnesses. The thesis examines whether this negative attitude towards mental illness, which some scholars have referred to as ???sanism???, is at work in the few Australian decisions which have considered the common law position in relation to mentally ill defendants. Possible changes to this area of law are then outlined and considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and control of the CO2 laser cutting process</field><field name="creator">El-Kurdi, Zeyad, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Laser cutting is one of the most important applications of laser in manufacturing industry; it is mainly used for sheet metal cutting. In laser cutting, performing real-time evaluation of laser cut quality is very important to the advancement of this process in industry. However, due to the dynamic nature of the laser cutting process specially when cutting ferrous alloys using oxygen as an assist gas, laser cut quality cannot be easily predicted; therefore, the quality inspection of the laser cut is performed by off line inspections of the edges of the metal by skilled operators. This methodology is carried out after the process and thus cannot maintain a good quality if the process performance is out of control. Therefore, the objective of the research project is to qualify and develop a sensor system that ensure fault recognition online and can automatically control the laser metal cutting process to achieve good quality cut. For the realization of this objective the following has been done: -	study the relationship between process parameters and cut quality characteristics;  -	identify the best sensors that can be used to monitor the process;  -	design and develop an experimental setup to test the proposed sensors;  -	collect and analyze data from the proposed sensors and correlate them to specific cut quality characteristics (process state variables);  -	develop direct relationships between the process signals and cut quality;  -	develop appropriate strategy for process control;  -	design and develop an integrated monitoring and control system;  -	test and evaluate the proposed system using simulation.  In this study, a new technique for the determination of cut quality of sheet steels under the CO2 laser cutting process has been established. It is based on on-line detection and post-processing analysis of light radiation and acoustic emissions from the cut kerf. Determination of machining quality during cutting is best done through the measurement of surface roughness and kerf widths, as these are the two parameters that vary in successful through cuts. These two quality parameters can further be correlated to the two dominant process parameters of laser power and cutting speed. This study presents an analysis of acoustic emissions and reflected light for CO2 laser cutting of steel plates, and discusses their use for the estimation of cut quality parameters of kerf width and striation frequency for mild steel plates of 3mm, 5mm, 8mm, and 10mm thicknesses. Airborne acoustic and light signals are acquired with a microphone and a photodiode respectively, and recorded with a PC based data acquisition system in real time. The signals are then analyzed to establish a correlation between the signals obtained and the cut quality achieved. Experimental evidence shows that the energy levels of acoustic emission signals (RMS analysis) can be used to maintain the cutting process under steady state condition. On the other hand, the light intensity signal fluctuates with a frequency that corresponds to the frequency of striations formed on the cut surface; therefore it can be used to regulate cutting speed and laser power to obtain an optimum cutting condition and best cut quality. The validity of the proposed control strategy was tested experimentally by simulating the variations of cutting speed and examining their effect on the signals. So far, the prototype used for experimentation has been successful in providing correct information about cut quality in terms of striation frequency, and also about the state of the process where the microphone signal was successful in determining system failure or improper cutting conditions. A microprocessor based control system utilizing the PID control algorithm is recommended for the implementation of the control strategy. The implementation requirements of the proposed system for industrial use are then discussed. A new setup for the coaxial monitoring of CO2 laser cutting using a photodiode is proposed to enhance the quality of the signal and also to protect the photodiode from the harsh cutting environment. It is also proposed that an open control architecture platform is needed to enhance the integration of the proposed process control functions. Conclusions and future research directions towards the achievement of Autonomous Production Cell (APC) for the laser cutting process are then given.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laser beam cutting</field><field name="subject">Metal-cutting</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide lasers</field><field name="subject">Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short term refractive and corneal topographic changes in hyperopic orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Gifford, Paul, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although there is considerable published research on the efficacy and corneal response to orthokeratology (OK) lenses that flatten corneal curvature to correct myopia, the effects of OK lenses that attempt to steepen corneal curvature to correct hyperopia are poorly understood. This project investigated the effects of hyperopic OK lens wear on corneal shape, refraction and vision.  Open-eye and closed-eye overnight studies were conducted with proprietary hyperopic OK lenses, and these led to the development of an experimental hyperopic OK lens design which allowed manipulation of individual lens design parameters. Changes to refraction and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal topography (Medmont E300), and the profile of total and stromal corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer) were measured over periods up to one week of overnight lens wear.  Most refractive change occurred after the first night of wear, with increasing effect towards one week. Retention of effect at the end of the day increased with more nights of lens wear. BCVA decreased with longer periods of lens wear. Greater inter-subject variability in effect was found with higher refractive targets.  The central cornea steepened and para-central cornea flattened producing a central steepening zone (CSZ) surrounded by a para-central annular flattened zone. CSZ diameter reduced with longer periods of lens wear, and this was significantly associated with decreases in high and low contrast BCVA.  There was no change in central corneal thickness beyond the normal overnight lens induced hypoxic edema response. Once edema had resolved thinning of the para-central corneal epithelium was found which resulted in an overall thinning of the para-central cornea.  Although central lens fenestrations did not affect the hyperopic OK response, a stronger relationship between changes to apical corneal curvature and refraction resulted. This supports the conclusion that the hyperopic OK effect is due to molding of the corneal surface towards alignment with the lens back surface. Similarities to the pattern of clinical change in myopic OK suggest that a similar corneal molding mechanism occurs in myopic OK. BCVA loss prevented longer term studies and needs to be resolved if hyperopic OK is to become established as a viable clinical technique.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lenses.</field><field name="subject">Cornea.</field><field name="subject">Hyperopic orthokeratology.</field><field name="subject">Refraction.</field><field name="subject">Vision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime in steelmaking slag and development of fluoride-free fluxes</field><field name="creator">Haji Amini, Shahriar, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">A rotating disk technique was used to determine the dissolution rate and diffusivity of CaO and MgO in slags. The dissolution rate was deduced from the measured changes in concentration of oxides in slag with respect to reaction time. The experimental set- up was initially tested with dissolution of magnesia in the CaO ??? 55 wt% Al2O3 slag at 1430 ??C and a measured rate of 2.7 ??10 -5 g/cm2.s was obtained. The dissolution rate was increased by slag chemistry and ranged from 6.5??10-5 to 2.1??10-4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rate of CaO was measured in CaO ??? 42 wt% Al2O3 ??? 8% SiO2 based slag. The measured dissolution rates were found to be strongly dependent on the slag chemistry and temperature and ranged from 5.03??10 -5 to 3.3??10 -4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rates were strongly dependent on the rotation speed and results indicate mass transfer in the slag phase to be rate- limiting step. The diffusivity of MgO / CaO was calculated from the dissolution rate and solubility data, using known mass transfer correlations. The diffusivity of MgO in the calcium aluminate slag at 1430 ??C was found to be about 1.1??10-5 cm2/s. Additions of 5 and 10 wt% Fe2O3 increased the diffusivity by a factor ~ 1.5 to 3, respectively. However, with introduction of (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 5 wt%) and (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 10 wt%) in the slag, the diffusivity increased considerably by a factor of about 29 and 11, respectively. The diffusivity of CaO in calcium aluminosilicate was measured to be in the order of 10-6 to 10-5 over a temperature range of 1430 ??? 1600 ??C. CaF2 increased the diffusivity by a factor of 3 to 5 while MnOx and FeOx, ilmenite and TiO 2 increased the diffusivity substantially and SiO2 had an opposite effect. The measured diffusivities are in accord with published data on comparable systems and are discussed with reference to Eyring theory. It was concluded that MnOx, FeOx and ilmenite in the slag increase the dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime, showing comparable results with respect to CaF2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slag</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">flux (metallurgy).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept</field><field name="creator">Dickman, Nancy Margaret, School of Health &amp; Sports Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on self-concept in the context of older women. Very little research in this area has focused on older women. At the same time it attempted to identify possible mechanisms underpinning exercise-induced change in self-concept, including the effect of the group and change in real and perceived body condition and real and perceived fitness. Adherence issues and the hierarchical structure of self-concept were examined in an exploratory manner. An extensive literature review was undertaken. It concluded with a preliminary exercise-self-concept model which would be used to explain and evaluate the thesis??? hypotheses. Two studies were undertaken. Study 1 validated the English version of the Self-perception in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ) (Sorensen, 1999) and examined relationships between exercise status, age, body size, and physical self-perceptions in a sample of older Australian women. The SPEQ was found to be a valid and reliable instrument to be used in Study 2 to measure self-perceptions relevant to exercise in older Australian women. Study 2, a randomised controlled trial, examined the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept. It comprises the main body of work for this thesis. It compared a group of older women exercising together in a group to a similar group of women who performed exactly the same exercise alone. Then both groups were compared to a similarly motivated group of women who did not exercise, but were waiting to start an exercise program. Using a pre-posttest design it measured exercise-induced change in self-concept, selfperceptions, satisfaction, and 13 physiological measures. Following a 12-week exercise treatment, the older women who walked regularly either alone or in a group thrice weekly experienced significantly improved total, physical, and social self-concept, more positive perceptions of their body and fitness, increased satisfaction with self and with life in general, and improved aerobic fitness compared to controls. When the three experimental conditions were compared, however, these outcomes were significant only for group exercise compared to controls; not for alone exercise compared to controls. Of greater importance, when the two exercise settings, walk alone and walk in a group, were compared, the women who walked in a group experienced significantly improved physical self-concept, satisfaction with life, and more positive perceptions of their body and fitness compared to the women who walked alone. Unexpectedly, aerobic fitness also increased significantly for the women who walked in a group relative to controls, but not for the alone walk condition. Taken together these findings suggest group exercise offers considerable psychological and aerobic fitness benefits to older women. These are valuable and unique findings. They are reinforced by the high adherence (91%) and participation rates (95%) achieved in the walk trial. Partial support was found for the proposed exercise-self-concept model and the hierarchical structure of self-concept was demonstrated. Perceived change accounted for more of the variance in self-concept than real body and fitness change. Effect sizes were larger for certain physical self-perceptions than for global self-concept. In conclusion, this thesis has extended current knowledge of exercise effects on selfconcept to older women, added a systematic exercise-self-concept review, added a useful instrument for measuring older women???s self-perceptions in exercise in future studies, and added to current knowledge of mechanisms underpinning improved self-concept following exercise. Exercise, moderate-intensity walking, was found to positively and significantly affect older women???s self-concept. The exercise setting differentially affected older women???s selfconcept; effects were significantly greater when the exercise was performed in a group with similar others. The group exercise setting and its effect on self-perceptions is suggested as a possible mechanism underpinning the positive exercise-self-concept association.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">exercise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality and the prediction of work performance: artificial neural networks versus linear regression</field><field name="creator">Minbashian, Amirali, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research that has evaluated the effectiveness of personality variables for predicting work performance has predominantly relied on methods designed to detect simple relationships. The research reported in this thesis employed artificial neural networks ??? a method that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear and configural relationships among variables ??? and the findings were compared to those obtained by the more traditional method of linear regression. Six datasets that comprise a range of occupations, personality inventories, and work performance measures were used as the basis of the analyses. A series of studies were conducted to compare the predictive performance of prediction equations that a) were developed using either artificial neural networks or linear regression, and b) differed with respect to the type and number of personality variables that were used as predictors of work performance. Studies 1 and 2 compared the two methods using individual personality variables that assess the broad constructs of the five-factor model of personality. Studies 3 and 4 used combinations of these broad variables as the predictors. Study 5 employed narrow personality variables that assess specific facets of the broad constructs. Additional methodological contributions include the use of a resampling procedure, the use of multiple measures of predictive performance, and the comparison of two procedures for developing neural networks. Across the studies, it was generally found that the neural networks were rarely able to outperform the simpler linear regression equations, and this was attributed to the lack of reliable nonlinearity and configurality in personality-work performance relationships. However, the neural networks were able to outperform linear regression in the few instances where there was some independent evidence of nonlinear or configural relationships. Consequently, although the findings do not support the  usefulness of neural networks for specifically improving the effectiveness of personality variables as predictors of work performance, in a broader sense they provide some grounds for optimism for organisational researchers interested in applying this method to investigate and exploit complex relationships among variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aggregate coalescence and factors affecting it.</field><field name="creator">Hasanah, Uswah</field><field name="description">The phenomenon called soil aggregate coalescence occurs at contact-points between aggregates and causes soil strength to increase to values that can inhibit plant root exploration and thus potential yield. During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to &#8216;weld&#8217; together with little or no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of &#8216;effective stresses&#8217; that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of drainage, penetrometer resistance was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0.3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect &#8220;Brazilian&#8221; crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; this was not the case for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0.49, 1.47 and 2.47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i.d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced &#8211; that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of &lt; 0.5, 0.5 &#8211; 2, 2 &#8211; 4, and &lt; 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores &#8211; being greater in the &lt; 0.5 mm and &lt; 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0.5 &#8211; 2 mm and 2 &#8211; 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil organic matter and irrigation technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy &#8211; that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs with little or no increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of sodicity of each soil was manipulated by varying the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2mm) above and below a nominal threshold value of 6. Dry aggregates were then packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to wetting near saturation, then draining to a suction of 100 kPa for one week as described above. Measurements were then taken of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength, both of which were affected by ESP in different ways. In the coarse-textured soil, sodicity enhanced aggregate slaking and dispersion, which increased bulk density. While penetrometer resistance also increased, its effect on aggregate coalescence could not be separated from a simple effect of increased bulk density. Similarly, the effect of sodicity on aggregate coalescence in the fine-textured soil was confounded by the higher water contents produced by greater swelling, which produced lower-than-expected penetrometer resistance. Measurements of tensile strength were conducted on air-dry samples, and so the confounding effects of bulk density and water content were eliminated and it was found that tensile strength increased with sodicity in both coarse- and fine-textured soils. The presence of dispersed clay was therefore implicated in the development of aggregate coalescence in this work. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of how the early stages of aggregate coalescence might affect plant growth was attempted using tomatoes (Gross lisse) as a test plant. Seeds were planted in aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 4 mm) of a coarse- or fine-textured soil packed in steel rings. These were wetted at a rate of 1 mm/h to either near-saturation (for maximum coalescence) or to a suction of 10 kPa (for minimum coalescence) and held under these conditions for 24 h. All samples were then transferred to a ceramic pressure plate for drainage to 100 kPa suction for one week. Samples were then placed in a growth-cabinet held at 20C with controlled exposure to 14 h light/day. Germination of the seeds, plant height, and number and length of roots were observed. Germination of the seeds held at near-saturation in both coarse- and fine-textured soils was delayed by 24 h compared with seeds held at 10 kPa suction. Neither the number nor the length of tomato roots differed significantly between the different treatments and soils. In the coarse-textured soil, however, the total root length over a period of 14 days was somewhat greater in the uncoalesced samples than in the coalesced samples, but this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that aside from delaying germination, aggregate coalescence may not have a large effect on early growth of tomato plants. However, this is not to say that detrimental effects may not be manifest at later stages of plant growth, and this certainly needs to be evaluated, particularly because aggregate coalescence increase with repeated cycles of wetting and draining. In conclusion, the primary findings of the work undertaken in this thesis were: &#8226; Rapid wetting of soil aggregates to near-saturation enhanced the onset of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by (in some cases) penetrometer resistance at a soil water suction of 100 kPa, and (in most cases) tensile strength of soil cores in the air-dry state. The rate of wetting appeared to be more important in bringing on aggregate coalescence than how wet the soil eventually became during wetting. This means reducing the rate at which irrigation water is applied to soils may reduce the onset of aggregate coalescence more effectively than controlling the total amount of water applied &#8211; though both are important. The literature reports that aggregate coalescence occurs in the field over periods of up to several months, involving multiple wetting and draining cycles, but the work here demonstrated that this can occur over much shorter time periods depending on conditions imposed. &#8226; Aggregate coalescence occurred in coarse-textured soils regardless of whether the bulk density increased during wetting and draining. In finer-textured soils, the response to wetting conditions varied and was complicated by changes in bulk density and water content due to swelling. &#8226; Small overburden pressures enhanced the onset of aggregate coalescence, but these effects were diminished in the presence of high soil organic matter contents. &#8226; Finer aggregate size distributions (which are often produced in the field by excessive tillage during seedbed preparation) invariably led to greater aggregate coalescence than coarser aggregate size distributions. The effects of aggregate size were mitigated to some extent by higher contents of soil organic matter. &#8226; Sodicity enhanced aggregate coalescence as measured by tensile strength, but when penetrometer resistance was measured in the moist state, the effects were masked to some extent by higher water contents generated by swelling and dispersion. This work suggests that tensile strength (in the air dry state) may be a more effective measure of aggregate coalescence than penetrometer resistance. &#8226; Early plant response to aggregate coalescence was not large, but the response may become magnified during later stages of growth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggregate; bulk density; coalescence; matric suction; organic matter; penetrometer resistance; sodicity; tensile strength; water content</field><field name="subject">Soil structure.</field><field name="subject">Soil penetration test.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor receptors in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Brierley, Gemma Victoria</field><field name="description">The IGF system is a crucial regulator of normal growth and development, however dysregulation of the system on multiple levels is associated with the incidence of a wide variety of malignancies including the breast, thyroid, lung, and colon, making the IGF system an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. Due to its role in mediating cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis, traditional focus has been set on examining the role of the type 1 IGF receptor [IGF1R] in cancer. However there is mounting evidence to suggest the insulin receptor [IR] may also be involved in the potentiation and pathogenesis of cancers. The observation that IGF-II is overexpressed, compared to normal tissues, by cancers suggests signaling via target receptors by this ligand has important implications on cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, both the IGF1R and IR have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in a variety of malignancies. In regards to IR isoform, the IGF-II binding IR-A is preferentially expressed by a number of cancer cell types. Together with the observation that an autocrine proliferative loop exists between IGF-II and the IR-A in malignant thyrocytes and cultured breast cancer cells, suggests signaling via the IR-A may play a role in cancer cell growth and survival. However, very few studies on the IR-A have been conducted in cells co-expressing the IGF1R. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with discrimination between signaling arising from IGF1R homodimers, IR-A homodimers, and IGF1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. It is not known how the IR-A interacts, and functions in conjunction with the other receptors of the IGF system to signal biologically relevant outcomes, especially in terms of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to block and down-regulate the IGF1R. Current anti-cancer therapies targeting the IGF system have concentrated on blocking IGF signaling via the IGF1R, due mostly to the functional properties of the receptor, but also in part due to the metabolic consequences associated with blockade and inhibition of the IR. This individual targeting of the IGF1R potentially leaves a pathway by which IGF-II secreted by the tumour can circumvent current IGF1R based therapies. Consequently, this thesis investigated whether the IR-A could compensate for the targeted loss of the IGF1R and how the IR-A interacts with the IGF1R in cells co-expressing these two receptors. In addition, the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation was assessed. The main experimental techniques used throughout this body of work included; assessment of protein expression and activation by Western blot, siRNA mediated gene silencing, and measures of cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The key areas of investigation included: 1. Investigation of the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation 2. Identification of an appropriate cell line model in which to investigate the interactions between the IR-A and IGF1R 3. Optimisation of siRNA mediated knock-down of the IR-A and IGF1R in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells 4. Determination of the biological role of the IR-A in SW480 cells co-expressing the IGF1R The key findings from this work included: 1. The IR-A could not compensate for IGF1R depletion in SW480 cells 2. Dual silencing of the IR-A and IGF1R indicated signaling via the IGF1R was dominant to signaling via the IR-A in SW480 cells 3. Signaling via IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors may not be as potent as signaling via IGF1R homodimers 4. IGF-I at physiological concentrations can stimulate biological responses via both isoforms of the IR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factors; cancer; colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell receptors.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role and impact of services sector on economic growth : an econometric investigation of tourism and air services in Fiji (1968-2006) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Management in Economics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Qasenivalu, Mosese Tavaga</field><field name="description">Empirical studies have established that tourism is a major determinant of economic growth and that international air services have a beneficial effect on the growth and development of an economy. It has also been argued that trade and public enterprise reforms in the service sectors, undertaken to a greater extent in high income countries, have had a positive impact on the sectors performances. This study analyses several hypotheses relating to Fiji&#8217;s tourism and air transport service industries. First the study examines the contribution of tourism exports to economic growth in the case of Fiji. Second, the study analyses whether the tourism reform adopted by Fiji in 1999 under the World Trade Organization&#8217;s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has impacted on total tourism export performance. Third, the aviation-service growth nexus is investigated. Lastly, the effect of the aviation public enterprise reform activities on the export performance of air services is evaluated. Using time series annual data from 1968 to 2006, the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag. methodology has been utilized to estimate the contribution of each service sector to Fiji&#8217;s total service output. The results show that the tourism is a major determinant of growth in Fiji and that the aviation service-growth hypothesis is also valid for Fiji. The empirical results show that both the trade reforms in tourism and the pro-competitive measures undertaken in the airline industry, amongst other determinants, have not significantly created an impact on the respective export performance of tourism and air services. These findings provide key policy implications in the light of capitalizing on services exports as a major source of growth, particularly in developing island countries such as Fiji and the need to facilitate the strengthening of the market to boost the export performance of tourism and air services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism export</field><field name="subject">tourism reform</field><field name="subject">aviation public enterprise</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lineage specific evolution and phylogenetic analysis : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomathematics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Grievink, Liat Shavit</field><field name="description">Phylogenetic models generally assume a homogeneous, time reversible, stationary process. These assumptions are often violated by the real, far more complex, evolutionary process. This thesis is centered on non-homogeneous, lineage-specific, properties of molecular sequences. It consist several related but independent studies. LineageSpecificSeqgen, an extension to the Seq-Gen program, which allows generation of sequences with changes in the proportion of variable sites, is introduced. This program is then used in a simulation study showing that changes in the proportion of variable sites can hinder tree estimation accuracy, and that tree reconstruction under the best-fit model chosen using a relative test can result in a wrong tree. In this case, the less commonly used absolute model-fit was a better predictor of tree estimation accuracy. This study found that increased taxon sampling of lineages that have undergone a change in the proportion of variable sites was critical for accurate tree reconstruction and that, in contrast to some earlier findings, the accuracy of maximum parsimony is adversely affected by such changes. This thesis also addresses the well-known long-branch attraction artifact. A nonparametric bootstrap test to identify changes in the substitution process is introduced, validated, and applied to the case of Microsporidia, a highly reduced intracellular parasite. Microsporidia was first thought to be an early branching eukaryote, but is now believed to be sister to, or included within, fungi. Its apparent basal eukaryote position is considered a result of long-branch attraction due to an elevated evolutionary rate in the microsporidian lineage. This study shows that long-branch estimates and basal positioning of Microsporidia both correlate with increased proportions of radical substitutions in the microsporidian lineage. In simulated data, such increased proportions of radical substitutions leads to erroneous long-branch estimates. These results suggest that the long microsporidian branch is likely to be a result of an increased proportion of radical substitutions on that branch, rather than increased evolutionary rate per se. The focus of the last study is the intriguing case of Mesostigma, a fresh water green alga for which contradicting phylogenetic relationships were inferred. While some studies placed Mesostigma within the Streptophyta lineage (which includes land plants), others placed it as the deepest green algae divergence. This basal positioning is regarded as a result of long-branch attraction due to poor taxon sampling. Reinvestigation of a 13- taxon mitochondrial amino acid dataset and a sub-dataset of 8 taxa reveals that site sampling, and in particular the treatment of missing data, is just as important a factor for accurate tree reconstruction as taxon sampling. This study identifies a difficulty in recreating the long-branch attraction observed for the 8-taxon dataset in simulated data. The cause is likely to be the smaller number of amino acid characters per site in simulated data compared to real data, highlighting the fact that there are properties of the evolutionary process that are yet to be accurately modeled.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular sequences</field><field name="subject">tree estimation accuracy</field><field name="subject">Microsporidia</field><field name="subject">long-branch attraction</field><field name="subject">Mesostigma</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of c-Jun in angiogenesis and cancer: insights using gene targeting approaches</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guishui, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most common causes of death worldwide. Angiogenesis plays a critical role tumourigenesis and atherogenesis. As a member of the basic region-leucine zipper protein family, c-Jun, has been linked with cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. However, the relationship between c-Jun and angiogenesis has not been firmly established.  In this thesis, strategies targeting c-Jun mRNA such as DNAzyme and siRNA have been designed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the c-Jun mRNA and c-Jun protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These agents block c-Jun expression and inhibit DNA binding activity of c-Jun. Luciferase assay showed that c-Jun siRNA suppressed c-Jun/AP-1-dependent reporter activity. The processes of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation were all down-regulated after treatment with c-Jun targeting agents. In vivo, c-Jun DNAzymes and siRNA inhibit angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis, including tumour angiogenesis and growth, matrix angiogenesis, corneal angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization. This is mediated, at least in part, by c-Jun siRNA or DNAzyme inhibition of MMP-2 expression.  These findings demonstrate the critical role played by c-Jun in the involvement of neovascularization and suggest that DNAzymes or siRNAs are efficient gene-silencing agents. The ability to identify and control key genes in angiogenesis provides opportunities for developing therapeutic molecular tools to treat cancer or other angiogenesis related diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Angiography</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc oxide TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) and polycrystalline silicon thin-films for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Song, Dengyuan, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films are very promising for application in photovoltaics. It is extremely challenging to develop cheap TCOs and poly-Si films to make photovoltaic devices. The aim of this thesis is to study sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO TCO and poly-Si films by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) for application in low-cost photovoltaics. The investigated aspects have been (i) to develop and characterize sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films that can be used as a TCO material on crystalline silicon solar cells, (ii) to explore the potential of the developed ZnO:Al films for application in ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, (iii) to make and characterize poly-Si thin-films on different kinds of glass substrates by SPC using electron-beam evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) [referred to as EVA poly-Si material (SPC of evaporated a-Si)], and (iv) to fabricate EVA poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass and improve the energy conversion efficiency of these cells by post-crystallization treatments. The ZnO:Al work in this thesis is focused on the correlation between film characteristics and deposition parameters, such as rf sputter power (Prf), working gas pressure (Pw), and substrate temperature (Tsub), to get a clear picture of film properties in the optimized conditions for application in photovoltaic devices. Especially the laterally non-uniform film properties resulting from the laterally inhomogeneous erosion of the target material are investigated in detail. The influence of Prf, Pw and Tsub on the structural, electrical, optical and surface morphology properties of ZnO:Al films is discussed. It is found that the lateral variations of the parameters of ZnO:Al films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering can be reduced to acceptable levels by optimising the deposition parameters.  ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabricated ZnO:Al films for application in heterojunction solar cells. In this application, expensive indium-tin oxide (ITO) is usually used. Under the standard AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2, 25 ??C), the best fabricated cell shows an open-circuit voltage of 411 mV, a short-circuit current density of 30.0 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 66.7 %, and a conversion efficiency of 8.2 %. This is believed to be the highest stable efficiency ever reported for this type of cell. By means of dark forward current density-voltage-temperature (J-V-T) measurements, it is shown that the dominant current transport mechanism in the ZnO:Al/c-Si solar cells, in the intermediate forward bias voltage region, is trap-assisted multistep tunneling. EVA poly-Si thin-films are prepared on four types of glass substrates (planar and textured glass, both either bare or SiN-coated) based on evaporated Si, which is a cheaper Si deposition method than the existing technologies. The textured glass is realized by the UNSW-developed AIT process (AIT = aluminium-induced texture). The investigation is concentrated on finding optimized process parameters and evaluating film crystallization quality. It is found that EVA poly-Si films have a grain size in the range 0.8-1.5 ??m, and a preferential (111) orientation. UV reflectance and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a high crystalline material quality, both at the air-side surface and in the bulk. EVA cells are fabricated in both substrate and superstrate configuration. Special attention is paid to improving the Voc of the solar cells. For this purpose, after the SPC process, the samples receive the two post-crystallization treatments: (i) a rapid thermal anneal (RTA), and (ii) a plasma hydrogenation. It is found that two post-crystallization treatments more than double the 1-Sun Voc of the substrate-type cells. It is demonstrated that RTA improves the structural material quality of the cells. Furthermore, a hydrogenation step is shown to significantly improve the electronic material quality of the cells. Based on the RTA???d and hydrogenated EVA poly-Si material, the first mesa-type EVA cells are fabricated in substrate configuration, by using sputtered Al-doped ZnO as the transparent front contact. The investigation is focused on addressing the correlation between the type of the substrate and cell performance. Optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the devices are characterized. It is found that the performance  of EVA cells depends on the glass substrate topography. For cells on textured glass, the AIT texture is shown to have a beneficial effect on the optical absorption of EVA films. It is demonstrated that a SiN barrier layer on the AIT-textured glass improves significantly both the crystalline quality of the poly-Si films and the energy conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells. For cells on planar glass, a SiN film between the planar glass and the poly-Si film has no obvious effect on the cell properties. The investigations in this thesis clearly show that EVA poly-Si films are very promising for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">thin films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of ideas of reason in Kant???s political philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Keating, Paula, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the power of ideas in political philosophy and practice. It argues firstly that Kant???s ideas of reason, as he originally defines them as regulative in the First Critique, play an important role in his political philosophy and his dynamic approach to politics. Secondly, because it is fundamentally concerned with political transition and improvement, Kant???s approach to politics is therefore one that has continuing relevance. Evidence for this is provided via an examination of Rawls??? political liberalism and the manner in which the idea of the reasonable fulfils the role of an idea of reason. The thesis begins with an examination of the regulative use of ideas of reason in the Dialectic of the First Critique: the ideas of soul, world and God become guides for practice, insofar as they are not bearers of truth but instead create essential conditions necessary for human life and meaning. Chapter Two then demonstrates how ideas of reason figure in Kant???s political texts. They condition politics by inspiring the practice of their objects, for example, the establishment of a rightful condition, the security of private property, the perpetuation of peace. That they look to the status quo in order to effect politics, demonstrates their concern with social progress. Chapter Three argues that publicity forms the primary political idea of reason as it enables the polity to use ideas of reason. Because publicity provides the test of efficient and rightful politics, we can say that it is through publicity that Kant???s politics is grounded. Chapter Four investigates Rawls??? political liberalism and observes that the primacy of the idea of the reasonable in his theory works according to a system of ideas of reason as proposed by Kant. Chapter Five then makes a final comparison between Kant and Rawls to demonstrate that ideas of reason, in particular the pre-eminent political idea of public reason, is central to both their conceptions of the political condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reason.</field><field name="subject">Political science.</field><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of climate anomalies and variability of Southern Ocean water masses on interannual to centennial time scales</field><field name="creator">Santoso, Agus, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study the natural variability of Southern Ocean water masses on interannual to centennial time scales is investigated using a long-term integration of the Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) coupled climate model. We focus our attention on analysing the variability of Antarctic IntermediateWater (AAIW), Circumpolar DeepWater (CDW), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). We present an analysis of the dominant modes of temperature and salinity (T - S) variability within these water masses. Climate signals are detected and analysed as they get transmitted into the interior from the water mass formation regions. Eastward propagating wavenumber-1, -2, and -3 signals are identied using a complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis along the core of the AAIW layer. Variability in air-sea heat uxes and ice meltwater rates are shown by heat and salt budget analyses to control variability of Antarctic Surface Water where density surfaces associated with AAIW outcrop. The dominant mode in the CDW layer is found to exhibit an interbasin-scale of variability originating from the North Atlantic, and propagating southward into the Southern Ocean. Salinity dipole anomalies appear to propagate around the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation with the strengthening and weakening of North Atlantic Deep Water formation. In the AABW layer, T - S anomalies are shown to originate from the southwestern Weddell Sea, driven by salinity variations and convective overturning in the region. It is also demonstrated that the model exhibits spatial patterns of T - S variability for the most part consistent with limited observational record in the Southern Hemisphere. However, some observations of decadal T - S changes are found to be beyond that seen in the model in its unperturbed state. We further assess sea surface temperature (SST) variability modes in the Indian Ocean on interannual time scales  in the CSIRO model and in reanalysis data. The emergence of a meridional SST dipole during years of southwest Western Australian rainfall extremes is shown to be connected to a large-scale mode of Indian Ocean climate variability. The evolution of the dipole is controlled by variations in atmospheric circulation driving anomalous latent heat uxes with wind-driven ocean transport moderating the impact of evaporation and setting the conditions favourable for the next generation phase of an opposite dipole.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climatic changes -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Ocean-atmosphere interaction -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short term refractive and corneal topographic changes in hyperopic orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Gifford, Paul, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although there is considerable published research on the efficacy and corneal response to orthokeratology (OK) lenses that flatten corneal curvature to correct myopia, the effects of OK lenses that attempt to steepen corneal curvature to correct hyperopia are poorly understood. This project investigated the effects of hyperopic OK lens wear on corneal shape, refraction and vision.  Open-eye and closed-eye overnight studies were conducted with proprietary hyperopic OK lenses, and these led to the development of an experimental hyperopic OK lens design which allowed manipulation of individual lens design parameters. Changes to refraction and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal topography (Medmont E300), and the profile of total and stromal corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer) were measured over periods up to one week of overnight lens wear.  Most refractive change occurred after the first night of wear, with increasing effect towards one week. Retention of effect at the end of the day increased with more nights of lens wear. BCVA decreased with longer periods of lens wear. Greater inter-subject variability in effect was found with higher refractive targets.  The central cornea steepened and para-central cornea flattened producing a central steepening zone (CSZ) surrounded by a para-central annular flattened zone. CSZ diameter reduced with longer periods of lens wear, and this was significantly associated with decreases in high and low contrast BCVA.  There was no change in central corneal thickness beyond the normal overnight lens induced hypoxic edema response. Once edema had resolved thinning of the para-central corneal epithelium was found which resulted in an overall thinning of the para-central cornea.  Although central lens fenestrations did not affect the hyperopic OK response, a stronger relationship between changes to apical corneal curvature and refraction resulted. This supports the conclusion that the hyperopic OK effect is due to molding of the corneal surface towards alignment with the lens back surface. Similarities to the pattern of clinical change in myopic OK suggest that a similar corneal molding mechanism occurs in myopic OK. BCVA loss prevented longer term studies and needs to be resolved if hyperopic OK is to become established as a viable clinical technique.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lenses.</field><field name="subject">Cornea.</field><field name="subject">Hyperopic orthokeratology.</field><field name="subject">Refraction.</field><field name="subject">Vision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept</field><field name="creator">Dickman, Nancy Margaret, School of Health &amp; Sports Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on self-concept in the context of older women. Very little research in this area has focused on older women. At the same time it attempted to identify possible mechanisms underpinning exercise-induced change in self-concept, including the effect of the group and change in real and perceived body condition and real and perceived fitness. Adherence issues and the hierarchical structure of self-concept were examined in an exploratory manner. An extensive literature review was undertaken. It concluded with a preliminary exercise-self-concept model which would be used to explain and evaluate the thesis??? hypotheses. Two studies were undertaken. Study 1 validated the English version of the Self-perception in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ) (Sorensen, 1999) and examined relationships between exercise status, age, body size, and physical self-perceptions in a sample of older Australian women. The SPEQ was found to be a valid and reliable instrument to be used in Study 2 to measure self-perceptions relevant to exercise in older Australian women. Study 2, a randomised controlled trial, examined the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept. It comprises the main body of work for this thesis. It compared a group of older women exercising together in a group to a similar group of women who performed exactly the same exercise alone. Then both groups were compared to a similarly motivated group of women who did not exercise, but were waiting to start an exercise program. Using a pre-posttest design it measured exercise-induced change in self-concept, selfperceptions, satisfaction, and 13 physiological measures. Following a 12-week exercise treatment, the older women who walked regularly either alone or in a group thrice weekly experienced significantly improved total, physical, and social self-concept, more positive perceptions of their body and fitness, increased satisfaction with self and with life in general, and improved aerobic fitness compared to controls. When the three experimental conditions were compared, however, these outcomes were significant only for group exercise compared to controls; not for alone exercise compared to controls. Of greater importance, when the two exercise settings, walk alone and walk in a group, were compared, the women who walked in a group experienced significantly improved physical self-concept, satisfaction with life, and more positive perceptions of their body and fitness compared to the women who walked alone. Unexpectedly, aerobic fitness also increased significantly for the women who walked in a group relative to controls, but not for the alone walk condition. Taken together these findings suggest group exercise offers considerable psychological and aerobic fitness benefits to older women. These are valuable and unique findings. They are reinforced by the high adherence (91%) and participation rates (95%) achieved in the walk trial. Partial support was found for the proposed exercise-self-concept model and the hierarchical structure of self-concept was demonstrated. Perceived change accounted for more of the variance in self-concept than real body and fitness change. Effect sizes were larger for certain physical self-perceptions than for global self-concept. In conclusion, this thesis has extended current knowledge of exercise effects on selfconcept to older women, added a systematic exercise-self-concept review, added a useful instrument for measuring older women???s self-perceptions in exercise in future studies, and added to current knowledge of mechanisms underpinning improved self-concept following exercise. Exercise, moderate-intensity walking, was found to positively and significantly affect older women???s self-concept. The exercise setting differentially affected older women???s selfconcept; effects were significantly greater when the exercise was performed in a group with similar others. The group exercise setting and its effect on self-perceptions is suggested as a possible mechanism underpinning the positive exercise-self-concept association.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">exercise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor receptors in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Brierley, Gemma Victoria</field><field name="description">The IGF system is a crucial regulator of normal growth and development, however dysregulation of the system on multiple levels is associated with the incidence of a wide variety of malignancies including the breast, thyroid, lung, and colon, making the IGF system an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. Due to its role in mediating cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis, traditional focus has been set on examining the role of the type 1 IGF receptor [IGF1R] in cancer. However there is mounting evidence to suggest the insulin receptor [IR] may also be involved in the potentiation and pathogenesis of cancers. The observation that IGF-II is overexpressed, compared to normal tissues, by cancers suggests signaling via target receptors by this ligand has important implications on cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, both the IGF1R and IR have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in a variety of malignancies. In regards to IR isoform, the IGF-II binding IR-A is preferentially expressed by a number of cancer cell types. Together with the observation that an autocrine proliferative loop exists between IGF-II and the IR-A in malignant thyrocytes and cultured breast cancer cells, suggests signaling via the IR-A may play a role in cancer cell growth and survival. However, very few studies on the IR-A have been conducted in cells co-expressing the IGF1R. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with discrimination between signaling arising from IGF1R homodimers, IR-A homodimers, and IGF1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. It is not known how the IR-A interacts, and functions in conjunction with the other receptors of the IGF system to signal biologically relevant outcomes, especially in terms of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to block and down-regulate the IGF1R. Current anti-cancer therapies targeting the IGF system have concentrated on blocking IGF signaling via the IGF1R, due mostly to the functional properties of the receptor, but also in part due to the metabolic consequences associated with blockade and inhibition of the IR. This individual targeting of the IGF1R potentially leaves a pathway by which IGF-II secreted by the tumour can circumvent current IGF1R based therapies. Consequently, this thesis investigated whether the IR-A could compensate for the targeted loss of the IGF1R and how the IR-A interacts with the IGF1R in cells co-expressing these two receptors. In addition, the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation was assessed. The main experimental techniques used throughout this body of work included; assessment of protein expression and activation by Western blot, siRNA mediated gene silencing, and measures of cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The key areas of investigation included: 1. Investigation of the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation 2. Identification of an appropriate cell line model in which to investigate the interactions between the IR-A and IGF1R 3. Optimisation of siRNA mediated knock-down of the IR-A and IGF1R in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells 4. Determination of the biological role of the IR-A in SW480 cells co-expressing the IGF1R The key findings from this work included: 1. The IR-A could not compensate for IGF1R depletion in SW480 cells 2. Dual silencing of the IR-A and IGF1R indicated signaling via the IGF1R was dominant to signaling via the IR-A in SW480 cells 3. Signaling via IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors may not be as potent as signaling via IGF1R homodimers 4. IGF-I at physiological concentrations can stimulate biological responses via both isoforms of the IR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factors; cancer; colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell receptors.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of financial development on economic activities in Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Phan, Nguyen Dinh</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impacts of financial development on economic activities in Vietnam at both the macro and the micro level in three core chapters. The first core chapter examines the role of financial development in growth and sources of growth in Vietnam by using the provincial panel data. It shows that financial development has a positive influence on the efficiency of using savings, on the quantity and quality of investment, on productivity, and hence growth. It also finds that there is an indirect impact of financial development on growth mainly through increasing the quality of foreign direct investment rather than the quantity. The following chapter analyses the determinants of household financial development and its role in economic activities of Vietnamese households by using the Household Data Survey. It suggests that the social relationship, location, fixed assets, household size, education, age and Kinh group are the key determinants of household financial development. Moreover, financial development contributes to household income through improving the level of savings and investment, labour productivity and reducing the problem of asymmetric information. Financial development is positively related to household welfare. The final core chapter looks at the impacts of financial development on firm performance in Vietnam by using the Firm Data Survey. It suggests that around 80.7% of Vietnamese firms lie between 0% and 20% in the efficiency scores derived from the DEA technique for 1,886 firms. Financial development plays a key role in firm performance. Smaller firms benefit more from the higher level of financial development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial development; growth; savings; investment; productivity; Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Economic development Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnam Economic conditions 1975-</field><field name="subject">Vietnam Social conditions 1975-</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of obesity and diet induced weight loss on cardiovascular risk factors, vascular and ventricular structure and function, prostate symptoms and sexual function in obese men.</field><field name="creator">Piantadosi, Cynthia</field><field name="description">Obesity is a major epidemic and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. The health problems and consequences of obesity include cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus. Each of these abnormalities directly promotes atherosclerosis. More recently, visceral obesity has been shown to be independently associated with abnormalities of both the ventricular and vascular structure and function. The mechanisms by which they occur remain incompletely defined. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) offers several advantages for evaluation of cardiac structure and function in the obese. The high accuracy and reproducibility of the technique allows for detection of very small changes in ventricular volumes, mass, ejection fraction, and cardiac output with a relatively small sample size, as compared with echocardiography. In this thesis we investigated whether cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging can better characterize possible cardiac abnormalities associated with obesity, in the absence of other confounding comorbidities. Obesity is associated with myocardial and vascular function, the extent of reversibility of these abnormalities with rapid acute weight loss remains uncertain. Therefore the first aim of the study was to (i) determine the relationship between obesity and left ventricular structure and function using magnetic resonance imaging, and (ii) the acute effects of rapid diet-induced weight loss on cardiac and vascular function in normal obese and obese diabetic men. Erectile dysfunction is related to cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity by an impairment of endothelial function. Therefore, symptoms of erectile dysfunction are probably to precede cardiovascular disease and events. The second aim of this study was to (i) determine the relationship between obesity and erectile function (EF), sexual desire (SD), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and quality of life (QOL) measures in obese males, and (ii) determine the effects of rapid diet-induced weight loss on EF, SD, LUTS and QOL measures in normal obese and obese diabetic men. In this group of men, obesity was associated with mild/moderate erectile dysfunction, and significant LUTS, which together with sexual desire improved following rapid diet induced weight loss, but was not directly related to the amount of weight loss or changes in measured metabolic state. Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) covers 80% of the heart and constitutes 20% of its weight. PAT mass is related to the amount of abdominal fat and the risk of coronary atherosclerosis. Epicardial fat mass may be a sensitive indicator of cardiovascular risk. The third aim of this study was to (i) determine the relationship between obesity and PAT volume and (ii) effectively evaluate the impact of caloric restriction and associated weight reduction on epicardical fat volume via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). This is the first study to show a reduction in PAT volume is associated with caloric restriction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity; ventricular function; Endothelial function; cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; sexual function</field><field name="subject">Men Health and hygiene.</field><field name="subject">Obesity in men.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system Diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and cellular mechanisms of increased angiogenesis in multiple myeloma : a role for CXCL12.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Sally K.</field><field name="description">Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable haematological malignancy characterised by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells (PCs) within the bone marrow (BM). MM PC survival and expansion is dependent upon an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients, and increased BM angiogenesis is a critical feature of MM progression. While MM PCs express and secrete a number of angiogenic factors, our current understanding of the precise mechanisms by which MM-induced angiogenesis occurs is incomplete. In this study, we collected specimens from patients with MM and the benign precursor condition MGUS, and demonstrated for the first time that circulating levels of the CXCL12 chemokine positively correlate with the degree of BM angiogenesis. Using conditioned media from a MM PC line, the contribution of MM PC-derived CXCL12 to angiogenesis was also examined and found to strongly induce vascular tube formation in vitro. In several other cell types, hypoxia has been shown to up-regulate CXCL12 expression. Studies investigating the hypoxic regulation of CXCL12 in MM PCs revealed that, while acute hypoxia is unable to stimulate CXCL12 expression, prolonged hypoxia significantly up-regulates CXCL12 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the mechanism(s) responsible for this, over-expression and RNA interference technology was employed to create genetically modified MM cells in which either HIF-1&#945; or HIF-2&#945; were overexpressed or knocked down. These studies showed that HIF-2&#945; is the predominant mediator of the hypoxic induction of CXCL12 in MM PCs. The ability of HIF-2&#945; to bind to the CXCL12 promoter was confirmed using EMSA and ChIP analyses. The role of CXCL12 in in vivo angiogenesis and the contribution of HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; were also examined. In these studies, transduced MM cells, in which HIF-1&#945;, HIF-2&#945; and CXCL12 were over-expressed or knocked down, were implanted into a vessel-poor, subcutaneous environment in immunocompromised mice. Tumour-induced angiogenesis was assessed after two weeks by measuring the haemoglobin content of excised implants. These studies confirmed that over-expression of CXCL12, HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; each stimulates a strong angiogenic response. Using the well-characterised CXCR4 antagonist, T140, CXCL12 was found to play a key role in the increased angiogenesis observed in response to HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; over-expression. These novel studies have shown that CXCL12 is an important mediator of angiogenesis in MM patients, and that aberrant CXCL12 expression by MM PCs is due, in part, to its hypoxic up-regulation mediated predominantly by HIF-2.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CXCL12; angiogenesis; multiple myeloma; SDF; hypoxia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International trade agreements.</field><field name="creator">Wei, Zhang</field><field name="description">In recent years, the use of the mode of regional trade liberalisation has proliferated, while the multilateral talks through the WTO have proceeded slowly, resulting in a debate on the role of bilateral and multilateral trade liberalisation. This thesis aims to provide new insights to this debate by studying the welfare effects of different types of trade agreements and the equilibrium outcome(s) of trade negotiation. We apply the three-country and three-good &#8220;competing-exporters model" developed by Bagwell and Staiger (1999) as our basic trade framework. By comparing the equilibrium welfare of each country under different structures of trading blocs, we clarify the welfare impacts of each trade agreement. Then we model the process of trade negotiation as a trade negotiation game, in which each country endogenously decides whether to negotiate through multilateral or bilateral trade liberalisation. By solving the equilibrium of the game, the stable structure of trading blocs and the path(s) to reach it can be found. We start with a framework in which all countries are welfare maximising. We find that at the early stage of trade negotiation, a free trade agreement (FTA) is Pareto welfare improving, despite the fact that member countries benefit more than any non-member. Although being the hub is the best position, a spoke is in a worse position than being outside a single FTA. Thus, a &#8220;hub-and-spoke" structure cannot be achieved and the unique equilibrium outcome of trade negotiation is given by multilateral free trade (MFT) through a multilateral trade agreement (MTA). The welfare-maximising analysis is followed by the examination of cases in which each government is politically motivated. The political structure we use is similar to Ornelas (2005), which follows the basic framework developed by Grossman and Helpman (1995), emphasising the interaction between lobby groups representing the special interest of one industry and the government in their home country. We first consider a circumstance where the political pressures are only from the import- competing sector. It is then generalised to a case in which all sectors are allowed to lobby the local government. Furthermore, the analysis is extended into an asymmetric world that includes two big countries and one small country. Our results show that political economy forces usually reduce the likelihood of forming trade agreements and that when the political concerns are sufficiently large, all trade agreements can be prevented by political pressures. Also, our findings suggest that the option of bilateral FTAs does not cause an initially infeasible MFT to become feasible, while a previously feasible MFT is likely to be blocked by the option of FTAs. Thus, our thesis provides some evidence to support the argument that the formation of FTAs can be a &#8220;stumbling block" for global trade liberalisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilateral trade agreements; multilateral trade liberalisation; political economy</field><field name="subject">International trade.</field><field name="subject">Foreign trade regulation.</field><field name="subject">Commercial treaties.</field><field name="subject">Tariff Law and legislation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproductive biology and recruitment dynamics of snapper, Chrysophrys auratus.</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Richard James</field><field name="description">The population dynamics and fishery productivity of snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, in South Australia are strongly driven by inter-annual variation in recruitment. This variable recruitment produces the occasional strong year-class which, over a number of years, results in a cycle of increasing and then decreasing biomass. The aim of this study was to develop an understanding of the recruitment dynamics of snapper through a study of the reproductive biology of adults, as well as the biology and ecology of 0+ recruits. Field sampling was done through 2006 to 2008 in northern Spencer Gulf, the region that generally contributes the majority of South Australia&#8217;s snapper catch. The recruitment of 0+ snapper was measured from a study of inter-and intra- annual patterns of distribution and abundance. This was done using two independent trawl sampling regimes, one using a beam trawl and the other an otter trawl, at different times in the settlement season. There was considerable inter-annual variation in abundance of 0+ fish of up to two orders of magnitude and, in some years, almost no recruitment was observed. The spatial pattern of dispersion of recruits was clumped and consistent between years; one area, Western Shoal, always produced the highest catches indicating that it is an important nursery. The effects of the timing of spawning and water temperature on growth patterns of the 0+ snapper collected in the trawl sampling were studied to determine possible impacts on recruitment processes. Growth was studied from age/length regressions and by measuring the widths of microincrements in the sagittal otoliths. Sub-surface water temperature was also logged in the region. Growth rate varied inter- and intra-annually but was not limited by temperature in the pre-settlement period. However, post-settlement growth rate was significantly correlated with water temperature and fish exhibited a dramatic slowing of growth as temperature declined in autumn. Later spawned fish were considerably smaller than earlier spawned fish of the same age, which may have implications for post-settlement survival. The reproductive biology of snapper was studied to determine if annual variation in recruitment was related to egg production. Reproductive samples from northern Spencer Gulf were collected over three seasons (2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/08) and were analysed macro- and microscopically. Spawning activity was determined by calculating estimates of spawning fraction and batch fecundities. The onset of spawning occurred in November but varied between years and corresponded with times when water temperature was between 18 and 20&#186;C. The length of the spawning season also differed between years. In each year the peak spawning activity occurred during December when fish spawned almost daily. Spawning frequency and relative batch size did not differ between the first two spawning seasons but, in the third season, batch size was considerably greater and spawning fraction lower. However, recruitment was considerably more variable than the annual differences in spawning output could explain. This indicates that mortality processes during the planktonic or early post-settlement period are important in the recruitment dynamics of snapper. The impact of water temperature, lunar cycle and tide on the timing and strength of recruitment was investigated. Pre-settlement duration, spawn dates and settlement dates were determined from the microstructure of the sagittal otoliths of 0+ snapper. The patterns of successful spawning and settlement were determined by back-calculating to the day on which individual recruits were spawned and settled. The frequency distributions of these dates were compared with water temperature, lunar periodicity and the temporal variation in spawning. There was considerable variation within a season in the timing and magnitude of successful recruitment. Strongest recruitment resulted from spawning during December and January on days when water temperatures were between 21 and 23&#186;C but spawning on days in this range did not necessarily result in recruitment. Pre-settlement duration was unaffected by water temperature. Some evidence of lunar periodicity was detected in both the spawn and settlement date frequencies. Importantly, the spawn date frequency distributions of successful 0+ recruits did not correspond with the measured spawning activity of adults as considerable portions of the spawning season in each year did not produce successful recruits. These results indicated that spawning output and water temperature cannot explain the observed magnitude in recruitment variation. Food availability for 0+ snapper has been implicated in their patterns of distribution and abundance in New Zealand and Japan. Stomach contents of 0+ snapper were described as an initial step in developing some understanding of the dispersion of 0+ recruits. In spite of their generalist feeding habit, in the area of highest abundance (Western Shoal), snapper took considerably more polychaetes than elsewhere in northern Spencer Gulf. If polychaetes are more abundant at Western Shoal, this could explain the higher density of 0+ snapper there but insufficient information was available on these animals for northern Spencer Gulf to address this hypothesis. Food availability and/or quality may influence the distribution of 0+ recruits. The multi-species collections from the beam trawls were described to develop an understanding of the spatial dispersion of recruits and their habitat associations. 0+ snapper co-occurred with an assemblage that was characterised by fish and invertebrate species that are associated with mud/soft bottom, but they never occurred with the assemblage of species associated with seagrass, even when recruitment was strongest. This association partly explains the observed distribution pattern, but not all areas of mud/soft bottom had 0+ recruits, even in strong recruitment years. In northern Spencer Gulf, seagrass areas could be excluded from future snapper recruitment surveys. The recruitment dynamics of snapper in northern Spencer Gulf were characterised by dramatic inter-annual variation but a consistent pattern of dispersion. 0+ snapper were concentrated in a few small areas in northern part of the study region. One of these areas, Western Shoal, appears to be very important as a nursery for snapper. Furthermore, the pattern of 0+ snapper dispersion was independent of recruitment strength. The potential magnitude of 0+ snapper recruitment, set by egg production, was altered by mortality during the early life history. Some of this mortality was related to temperature regimes at the time of spawning but this did not explain all the variation in the magnitude and timing of recruitment. Snapper spawning occurred at times with suitable temperature conditions but recruitment did not always result. This indicates the presence of other factor(s) that have substantial influences on mortality in the early life history.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spencer Gulf; assemblage; diet Pagrus</field><field name="subject">Chrysophrys auratus</field><field name="subject">Fishes Reproduction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse, subjectivity and the policy realm : reconceptualising policy workers as located subjects.</field><field name="creator">Gill, Zoe&#776; Margaret Alice</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

Four data collection methods were utilised generating 33,058 adult or larval invertebrates. The sampling methods comprised benthic kick-sampling, sticky trapping, light trapping, and emergence trapping. For the sticky trapping and light trapping, sampling was carried out at three different sites (Sites 1&#8211;3) within each location. The sites were situated within three habitat types; native forest, native forest-fringe, and raupo wetland. Emergence trapping also commenced within the three sites, at both locations, but was discontinued after two months, due to the equipment being destroyed by consecutive flooding events (method described in Appendix 1). Benthic sampling was carried out within the Forest and Forest-fringe habitats. Benthic sampling, sticky trapping, and light trapping were carried out following a monthly schedule between June and November 2005. Conductivity, pH, and water temperature measurements were taken concurrently with benthic sampling on a monthly basis, while water velocity and substrate measurements were taken once to assist in habitat characterisation. Overall, 71 taxa were recorded by benthic sampling over the six month period, with a mean of approximately 30 taxa per site per month. In comparison with similar studies elsewhere in New Zealand, a figure of around 30 taxa per sample was high. The benthic macroinvertebrate fauna at all sites was dominated by Trichoptera (19 taxa), Diptera (16 taxa) and Ephemeroptera (10 taxa). This pattern of diversity is similar to that reported in other New Zealand studies. However, in contrast to previous studies, the leptophlebiid mayfly genus Deleatidium was not numerically dominant over the rest of the community, and other leptophlebiid genera (Acanthophlebia, Atalophlebioides, Mauiulus and Zephlebia) were equally represented, possibly reflecting niche partitioning between the groups. The genus Nesameletus was not recorded at any site, despite being one of the core mayfly species in New Zealand streams. The rare mayfly Isothraulus abditus was recorded at one of the forest locations. There are no published records of this species from Northland. Although acknowledged as another of the core New Zealand benthic taxa, the hydropsychid caddisfly Aoteapsyche was not recorded during the study. However, another hydropsychid, Orthopsyche, was commonly recorded, and these may be filling a similar niche to the Aoteapsyche genus. In contrast to the Trichoptera, Diptera, and Ephemeroptera, the Plecoptera fauna was relatively depauperate, probably reflecting the warmer climate of the region and lack of temperature-buffered spring-fed streams. Surprisingly, Zelandobius, a core New Zealand genus, was absent but is regularly recorded in Northland. A species of conservation interest, Spaniocercoides watti, currently recognised as a Northland endemic, was recorded in low numbers. There were no apparent trends in diversity or abundance of benthic invertebrates over time. Also, there were no significant differences in species diversity between the two locations. However, in many cases, taxa were more abundant at Location 2. This may have been due to steeper gradients at Location 2, and the consequent effects on substrate size and streambed stability, as all other physical factors appeared similar between locations. Although several significant differences of individual benthic taxa were recorded, no broad effect of habitat (sites) on species diversity was observable. However, at Location 2, abundances were significantly higher at Site 3 (Forest) compared to Site 2 (Forest-fringe). The reasons were uncertain, but may be attributed to higher retention of allochthonous organic materials, trapped by in-stream cover and larger substrates. Investigations of adult stages by sticky traps supported benthic results recording community compositions and abundances dominated by Trichoptera and Diptera. Plecoptera were poorly represented. Location 2 recorded higher abundances of taxa, particularly Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera. Investigations of adult stages by light traps however did not produce any statistically significant differences in abundances between sites, between locations, or between sites across locations, and it is believed to be due to limited sampling replication combined with some biases of light trapping. This study indicates that the aquatic invertebrate community at Matapouri is diverse but also reasonably representative. Several rare or uncommon insects inhabit the catchment. It is therefore important that Iwi and the local Landcare Group, who invited and supported this research, together with the Department of Conservation, continue their efforts in protecting these areas. The resident fauna have the capacity to restock areas downstream, which are intended to be improved and restored through sediment control and riparian management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic insects</field><field name="subject">Community composition</field><field name="subject">Habitat use</field><field name="subject">Kick sampling</field><field name="subject">Benthic macroinvertebrates</field><field name="subject">Northland</field><field name="subject">Light trapping</field><field name="subject">Sticky trapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of strengthened unreinforced masonry (URM) walls by new retrofitting technologies for blast loading.</field><field name="creator">Su, Yu</field><field name="description">Terrorism has become a serious threat in the world, with bomb attacks carried out both inside and outside buildings. There are already many unreinforced masonry buildings in existence, and some of them are historical buildings. However, they do not perform well under blast loading. Aiming on protecting masonry buildings, retrofitting techniques were developed. Some experimental work on studying the effect of retrofitted URM walls has been done in recent years; however, these tests usually cost a significant amount of time and funds. Because of this, numerical simulation has become a good alternative, and can be used to study the behaviour of masonry structures, and predict the outcomes of experimental tests. This project was carried out to find efficient retrofitting technique under blast loading by developing numerical material models. It was based on experimental research of strengthening URM walls by using retrofitting technologies under out-of-plane loading at the University of Adelaide. The numerical models can be applied to study large-scaled structures under static loading, and the research work is then extended to the field of blast loading. Aiming on deriving efficient material models, homogenization technology was introduced to this research. Fifty cases of numerical analysis on masonry basic cell were conducted to derive equivalent orthotropic material properties. To study the increasing capability in strength and ductility of retrofitted URM walls, pull-tests were simulated using interface element model to investigate the bond-slip relationship of FRP plates bonded to masonry blocks. The interface element model was then used to simulate performance of retrofitted URM walls under static loads. The accuracy of the numerical results was verified by comparing with the experimental results from previous tests at the University of Adelaide by Griffith et al. (2007) on unreinforced masonry walls and by Yang (2007) on FRP retrofitted masonry walls. To study the de-bonding behaviours of retrofits bonded to masonry, and find appropriate solution to protect certain masonry walls against blast loading, various retrofitting technologies were examined. The simulation covers explosive impacts of a wide range of impulses. Based on this work, pressure-impulse diagrams for different types of retrofitted URM walls were developed as a design guideline for estimating the blast effect on retrofitted masonry walls. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the development of numerical simulation on modelling retrofitted URM walls, improving the technique for explosion-resistant of masonry buildings, and providing a type of guideline for blast-resistant design.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retrofitting; FRP; Masonry; Blast; Aluminium foam; Spray-on polyurea; Numerical</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Building materials -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Blast effect -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and cellular mechanisms of increased angiogenesis in multiple myeloma : a role for CXCL12.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Sally K.</field><field name="description">Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable haematological malignancy characterised by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells (PCs) within the bone marrow (BM). MM PC survival and expansion is dependent upon an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients, and increased BM angiogenesis is a critical feature of MM progression. While MM PCs express and secrete a number of angiogenic factors, our current understanding of the precise mechanisms by which MM-induced angiogenesis occurs is incomplete. In this study, we collected specimens from patients with MM and the benign precursor condition MGUS, and demonstrated for the first time that circulating levels of the CXCL12 chemokine positively correlate with the degree of BM angiogenesis. Using conditioned media from a MM PC line, the contribution of MM PC-derived CXCL12 to angiogenesis was also examined and found to strongly induce vascular tube formation in vitro. In several other cell types, hypoxia has been shown to up-regulate CXCL12 expression. Studies investigating the hypoxic regulation of CXCL12 in MM PCs revealed that, while acute hypoxia is unable to stimulate CXCL12 expression, prolonged hypoxia significantly up-regulates CXCL12 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the mechanism(s) responsible for this, over-expression and RNA interference technology was employed to create genetically modified MM cells in which either HIF-1&#945; or HIF-2&#945; were overexpressed or knocked down. These studies showed that HIF-2&#945; is the predominant mediator of the hypoxic induction of CXCL12 in MM PCs. The ability of HIF-2&#945; to bind to the CXCL12 promoter was confirmed using EMSA and ChIP analyses. The role of CXCL12 in in vivo angiogenesis and the contribution of HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; were also examined. In these studies, transduced MM cells, in which HIF-1&#945;, HIF-2&#945; and CXCL12 were over-expressed or knocked down, were implanted into a vessel-poor, subcutaneous environment in immunocompromised mice. Tumour-induced angiogenesis was assessed after two weeks by measuring the haemoglobin content of excised implants. These studies confirmed that over-expression of CXCL12, HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; each stimulates a strong angiogenic response. Using the well-characterised CXCR4 antagonist, T140, CXCL12 was found to play a key role in the increased angiogenesis observed in response to HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; over-expression. These novel studies have shown that CXCL12 is an important mediator of angiogenesis in MM patients, and that aberrant CXCL12 expression by MM PCs is due, in part, to its hypoxic up-regulation mediated predominantly by HIF-2.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CXCL12; angiogenesis; multiple myeloma; SDF; hypoxia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence, taxonomy, biology and pathogenicity of aphelenchid nematodes associated with conifers in south-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Zeng Qi, Zhao</field><field name="description">Australia has large plantations of exotic Pinus radiata conifers. This species is highly susceptible to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wilt nematode, which is not found in Australia. Potentially pathogenic nematodes were isolated from several dead Pinus trees in Williamstown, Heidelberg and Knoxfield, suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria in 2000-2002. A survey of the above-ground nematode fauna of Pinus and other conifers in south--eastern Australia was undertaken. Stands of Pinus were surveyed in the Kuipto Forest and the South-East Region of SA; the south-west and the Gippsland region of Victoria; and the Hume region in NSW; and native Callitris preissii was sampled in the Murray Mallee. A total of 1140 samples from P. radiata, 50 from P. pinaster and 40 from C. preissii were examined. No nematodes were found in wood or young shoots of conifers except in the wood samples from diseased trees at Knoxfield and Heidelberg in Victoria. In contrast, nematodes were common in the bark samples of healthy trees. Morphologically, extracted nematodes were classified into five trophic groups, including: aphelenchida (plant, fungal and lichen feeders), rhabditids and areolaimids (bacterial feeding), Macrolaimus spp. (saprophagus), tylenchids (plant feeding), and dorylaimids (bacterial and algal feeders). Aphelenchids were the most commonly found trophic group. Three genera and twelve morphospecies of aphelenchids were identified. Eight species of Laimaphelenchus and one putative species of Acugutturus appear to be new records for Australia. Descriptions of two new species, L. preissii and L. australis have been published. Three species of Aphelenchoides were also found. No Bursaphelenchus spp. were found. Molecular studies included sequencing of the ITS region of Laimaphelenchus preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, and Aphelenchid H1; D2D3 fragments of 28S and 18S of L. preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, and Aphelenchid H1, Laimaphelenchus australis, and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg; and COI of three aphelenchid morphospecies L. preissii, Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg and Aphelenchid K1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Laimaphelenchus spp. are new species and that the unknown aphelenchids are close to Aphelenchoides. None of the six isolates studied from Australia was close to Bursaphelenchus. Population growth and mean doubling time of L. preissii, Aphelenchid K1 and Aphelenchid H1 were studied at different temperatures and on different food resources. The different species had markedly different population growth rates, which were significantly affected by temperature and food. A study on desiccation was carried out with L. preissii and morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, Aphelenchid H1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg. Ability to survive desiccation varied between species, and the recovery rate of the different species was significantly different. A pathogenicity study was performed using young P. radiata trees in a shadehouse. No symptoms were observed following inoculation with Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, Aphelenchid H1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg isolated from diseased P. radiata in Victoria, or L. preissii from native Callitris in South Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-throughput assays for biotin protein ligase: a novel antibiotic target.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Belinda Ling Nah</field><field name="description">Antibiotics are defined as chemical substances that inhibit or limit the growth of microorganisms. Since the second world war, antibiotics have been widely used to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with serious bacterial infections caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, it has become increasingly difficult to treat bacterial infections due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. The first clinical case of drug resistant bacteria was observed in S. aureus in 1947, just four years after the mass production of penicillin. Since then, resistance has been reported to every antibiotic ever employed. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, more than 70% of hospital-acquired infections show resistance to at least one commonly used antibiotic. Coupled with the paucity of therapeutic agents in the pipeline, there is now an urgent demand for new antibiotics. One of the strategies employed to combat drug resistant bacteria requires new chemical entities that work through novel drug targets for which there is no pre-existing resistance. This thesis focuses on the essential metabolic enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) as one such new drug target. BPL is the enzyme responsible for covalently attaching the cofactor biotin prosthetic group onto the biotin-dependent enzymes such as the carboxylases, decarboxylases and transcarboxylases. Enzymatic biotinylation proceeds via a two-step reaction whereby biotinyl-5'-AMP is synthesized from biotin and ATP before the biotin moiety is transferred onto the side chain of one specific lysine present in the active site of the biotin-dependent enzyme. One example of an important biotin-dependent enzyme is acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Through genetic studies, it has been demonstrated that BPL activity is essential for bacterial survival. The aim for this project was to develop a convenient, high-throughput assay to measure BPL activity. This assay would permit 1) quantitative kinetic analysis of ligands and inhibitors and 2) screening of compound libraries for new BPL inhibitors. We propose that BPL inhibitors can be developed into new antibiotic agents. The novel BPL assay was developed employing fluorescence polarization (FP). FP is a light based technique which uses plane polarized light for the detection of tumbling motion of fluorescent molecules in solution. As polarization of the emitted light is relative to the apparent molecular mass of the fluorophore, this technique can be use for quantitation of changes in molecular mass of target molecules. This enabled 1) rapid kinetic analysis, 2) a minimal number of handling steps, 3) no washing steps and 4) automation by robotics. A first generation assay was developed for Escherichia coli BPL using peptide 85-11 that has been shown to be a convenient substrate. Following the BPL reaction, biotinylated peptides will form large molecular mass complexes with avidin. The amount of product could then be quantitated using FP. Here, kinetic analysis of MgATP (Km 0.25 &#177; 0.01 mM) and biotin (Km 1.45 &#177; 0.15 &#956;M) binding produced results consistent with published data. We validated this assay with inhibition studies with end products of the BPL reaction, AMP and pyrophosphate, and a compound, biotinol-5'-AMP. Statistical analysis, performed upon both intraassay and interassay results (n = 30), showed the coefficient of variance to be &lt;10% across all data sets. Furthermore, the Z' factors between 0.5 and 0.8 demonstrated the utility of this technology in high-throughput applications. However, the use of peptide 85-11, a substrate specific to E. coli BPL, does limit the application of this methodology to E. coli. In the second generation FP assay, I adapted this technology for S. aureus BPL by employing the biotin domain of S. aureus pyruvate carboxylase. Insertion of a fluorescein label was achieved by first engineering a cysteine residue into the domain by site directed mutagenesis then incubation with fluorescein-5'-maleimide. A series of mutants was created to investigate optimal positioning of the label into the substrate. Furthermore, the minimal size of the functional domain was determined. Our data showed that the placement of the fluorescein label is an important aspect of this project. Using this approach, I identified that a 90 amino acid domain with the label at position 1134 was optimal. Kinetic analysis of ligand binding showed SaBPL had a Km for biotin at 3.29 &#177; 0.37 &#956;M and Km for MgATP at 66 &#177; 16.08 &#956;M. This was in good agreement with data obtained from our previous assay measuring &#179;H-biotin incorporation. Inhibitor studies with pyrophosphate and analogues of biotin and biotinyl-5'-AMP further validated the assay. Various studies have shown cross-species biotinylation activities by a diverse range of BPLs. Therefore, using this methodology with a biotin domain as the substrate potentially provides a convenient assay for all BPLs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biotin protein ligase; fluorescence polarization; enzyme assay; high-throughput compound screening</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The filamin A actin binding domain structure and function: implications for a gain-of-function mechanism for the otopalatodigital syndrome: a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand [Ph.

International research shows that oral health care for pregnant women has been inadequate, especially in relation to education and health promotion and there is some evidence of disparities by SES and ethnicity. Improving oral health is one of the health priorities in the New Zealand Health Strategy (Ministry of Health, 2000) and the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health, 2006a) has recently identified a need for more information on the oral health and behaviour of pre-natal women. The aims of this study were to gain an understanding of pregnant women?s oral health care practices, access to oral health care information and use of dental care services and to identify any difference by ethnicity and socio-economic position. A self-reported questionnaire was completed by 405 pregnant women (55% response rate) who attended antenatal classes in the Wellington region. The questionnaire was broadly divided into four parts: (1) care of the teeth when the woman was not pregnant; (2) care of the teeth and diet during the pregnancy; (3) sources of oral health information during pregnancy and; (4) demographic information . Data were analysed by age, ethnicity, education and income and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using logistic regression. The majority of women in this survey were pakeha (80.2%), compared to 19.7% &#8222;Others? (8.8% Maori, 1.9% Pacific, 8.6% other). Most of the subjects were aged 31-35 years (34.5%), of high SES (household income and education level). Half of the women reported having regular visits to the dentist previous pregnancy while a significant percentage of women saw a dentist basically when they had problems. The usual dental hygiene habits were maintained during pregnancy. However, during pregnancy more than 60% of women reported bleeding gums. Just 32% of women went to see the dentist during pregnancy and less than half had access to oral health information related to pregnancy. &#8222;Others? (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.91) and low income (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.76) groups were significantly less likely to report access to oral health information compared to pakeha and high income groups (respectively). Women who went to see the dentist during pregnancy were more likely to receive information on dental health. However, low income women were more likely to report the need to see a dentist (OR 2.55, CI 1.08-5.99). Information on dental health and access to oral care should be prioritised to low income women, Maori, Pacific and other ethnic groups. Little attention has previously been given to oral health for pregnant women in New Zealand and there is a need to increase awareness of the importance of this area amongst health practitioners particularly Lead Maternity Carers and Plunket and tamariki ora nurses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental care services</field><field name="subject">maternity services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empiricism and Philosophy</field><field name="creator">Sinclair, Nathan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quine</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">meta-philosophy</field><field name="subject">analyticity</field><field name="subject">concepts</field><field name="subject">Empiricism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic bacteria for hatchery production of Greenshell mussels, Perna canaliculus</field><field name="creator">Kesarcodi-Watson, Aditya</field><field name="description">The Greenshell&#8482; mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mining surprising patterns</field><field name="creator">Kuo, Yen-Ting</field><field name="description">From the perspective of an end-user, patterns derived during the data mining process are not always interesting.

Until recently, music therapists rarely documented or explored the potential of performance for music therapy practice while some health professionals even suggested that performance is anti-therapeutic (See Maratos, 2004). Music therapists writing about their practices in forensic settings emphasise the therapeutic potentials of singing and song writing rather than performance and they predominantly approach these activities from a behavioural orientation. The almost singular theoretical approach to practising music therapy in forensic settings reflects a lack of relevant research. Consequently, the purpose underlying this research is to explore the therapeutic potentials of making and performing music with women in prison from an alternative perspective; namely humanistic rather than behavioural. The aim of this research is not only to examine previously undocumented processes in music therapy such as performance but also to contribute to the literature concerning the health and wellbeing of women in prison.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music, music as therapy, theatre, creativity, community cultural development, women, prison</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamic interplay of mechanisms governing infiltration into structured and layered soil columns</field><field name="creator">Carrick, Sam</field><field name="description">Worldwide there is considerable concern over the effects of human activities on the quantity and quality of freshwater. Measurement of infiltration behaviour will be important for improving freshwater management. This study identifies that New Zealand has a sporadic history of measuring soil water movement attributes on a limited number of soil types, although the current practical demand should be large for management of irrigation, dairy farm effluent disposal, as well as municipal / domestic waste- and storm-water disposal. Previous research has demonstrated that infiltration behaviour is governed by the interplay between numerous mechanisms including hydrophobicity and preferential flow, the latter being an important mechanism of contaminant leaching for many NZ soils. Future characterisation will need to recognise the dynamic nature of these interactions, and be able to reliably characterise the key infiltration mechanisms. Since macropores are responsible for preferential flow, it is critical that infiltration studies use a representative sample of the macropore network. The aim of this project was to study the mechanisms governing the infiltration behaviour of a layered soil in large (50 x 70 cm) monolith lysimeters, where the connectivity of the macropore network remains undisturbed. Four lysimeters of the Gorge silt loam were collected, a structured soil with four distinct layers. On each lysimeter there were four separate infiltration experiments, with water applied under suctions of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 kPa by a custom-built tension infiltrometer. Each lysimeter was instrumented with 30 tensiometers, located in arrays at the layer boundaries. There was also a field experiment using ponded dye infiltration to visually define preferential flowpaths. Analysis of dye patterns, temporal variability in soil matric potential (&#936;m), and solute breakthrough curves all show that preferential flow is an important infiltration mechanism. Preferential flowpaths were activated when &#936;m was above -1.5 kPa. During saturated infiltration, at least 97% of drainage was through the &#8216;mobile&#8217; pore volume of the lysimeter (&#952;m), estimated among the lysimeters at 5.4 &#8211; 8.7 % of the lysimeter volume. Early-time infiltration behaviour did not show the classical square-root of time behaviour, indicating sorptivity was not the governing mechanism. This was consistent across the four lysimeters, and during infiltration under different surface imposed suctions.  The most likely mechanism restricting sorptivity is weak hydrophobicity, which appears to restrict infiltration for the first 5 &#8211; 10 mm of infiltration. Overall, the Gorge soil&#8217;s early-time infiltration behaviour is governed by the dynamic interaction between sorptivity, hydrophobicity, the network of air-filled pores, preferential flow and air encapsulation. Long-time infiltration behaviour was intimately linked to the temporal dynamics of &#936;m, which was in turn controlled by preferential flow and soil layer interactions. Preferential flowpaths created strong inter-layer connectivity by allowing an irregular wetting front to reach lower layers within 2 &#8211; 15 mm of infiltration. Thereafter, layer interactions dominate infiltration for long-time periods, as &#936;m in soil layers with different K(&#936;m) relationships self-adjusts to try to maintain a constant Darcy velocity. An important finding was that &#936;m rarely attained the value set by the tension infiltrometer during unsaturated infiltration. The results show that &#8216;true&#8217; steady-state infiltration is unlikely to occur in layered soils. A quasi-steady state was identified once the whole column had fully wet and layer interactions had settled to where &#936;m changes occurred in unison through each soil layer. Quasi-steady state was difficult to identify from just the cumulative infiltration curve, but more robustly identified as when infiltration matched drainage, and &#936;m measurements showed each layer had a stable hydraulic gradient.  I conclude that the in-situ hydraulic conductivity, K(&#936;m), of individual soil layers can be accurately and meaningfully determined from lysimeter-scale infiltration experiments. My results show that K(&#936;m) is different for each soil layer, and that differences are consistent among the four lysimeters. Under saturated flow the subsoil had the lowest conductivity, and was the restricting layer. Most interestingly this pattern reversed during unsaturated flow. As &#936;m decreased below -0.5 to -1 kPa, the subsoil was markedly more conductive, and the topsoil layers became the restricting layers. All four soil layers demonstrate a sharp decline in K(&#936;m) as &#936;m decreases, with a break in slope at ~ -1 kPa indicating the dual-permeability nature of all layers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infiltration</field><field name="subject">layered soil</field><field name="subject">preferential flow</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">hydraulic conductivity</field><field name="subject">hydrophobicity</field><field name="subject">dual-permeability</field><field name="subject">mobile water content</field><field name="subject">lysimeter</field><field name="subject">tension infiltrometer</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initiation of invasive disease in M1T1 group A streptococcus</field><field name="creator">Hollands, Andrew</field><field name="description">Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) is an important human pathogen that colonizes epithelial and mucosal surfaces. Group A streptococcal disease can be relatively minor, such as streptococcal pharyngitis, or severe and life-threatening, such as necrotizing fasciitis. There has been a resurgence of severe infection with GAS since the mid-1980s that has been paralleled be the emergence of a globally disseminated clone, M1T1. The M1T1 clone of GAS presents as the most common cause of streptococcal pharyngitis in developed countries and are also overrepresented in cases of severe infection. Most invasive bacterial infections are caused by species that more commonly colonize the human host with minimal or no symptoms. Although phenotypic or genetic correlates underlying a bacterium&#8217;s shift to enhanced virulence potential have been studied, the in vivo selection pressures governing such shifts are poorly understood. The globally disseminated M1T1 clone of GAS is linked with the rare but life-threatening syndromes of necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Mutations in the group A streptococcal control of virulence regulatory sensor kinase (covR/S) operon are associated with severe invasive disease, abolishing expression of a broad spectrum cysteine protease (SpeB) and allowing the recruitment and activation of host plasminogen on the bacterial surface. This study describes how a bacteriophage-encoded group A streptococcal DNase (Sda1), which facilitates the pathogen&#8217;s escape from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), can serve as a selective force for covR/S mutation. The results provide a paradigm whereby horizontal gene transfer and natural selection exerted by the innate immune system iv generate hypervirulent bacterial variants with increased risk of systemic dissemination. This study sought to investigate if there was a cost of fitness associated with covR/S mutation that counterbalances the dramatic increase in virulence. It was found that covR/S mutant bacteria had reduced capacity to bind fibronectin and collagen, both components of the extracellular matrix bound by streptococcal adhesins. The covR/S mutant strain examined in this study also showed reduced capacity to bind to epithelial cell layers as a consequence of increased capsule expression. This mutant strain displayed reduced capacity to form biofilms. An animal model of skin colonization was used to show that the covR/S mutant strain has a colonization defect. This reduced capacity to colonize presents an explanation as to why hypervirulent covR/S mutant M1T1 group A streptococci are not rapidly spread amongst the community. The role of SpeB in the course of infection is still unclear. This study utilized a SpeB-negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence. Allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to replace the mutated ropB allele in 5628 with the intact allele from the well characterized isolate 5448. The inverse allelic exchange was also performed to replace the intact ropB in 5448 with the mutated allele from 5628. An intact ropB was found to be essential for SpeB expression. While the ropB mutation was shown to have no effect on haemolysis of RBCs, extracellular DNase activity or survival in the presence of neutrophils, strains with the mutated ropB allele were less virulent in murine systemic models of v infection. An isogenic SpeB knockout strain containing an intact RopB showed similarly reduced virulence. Microarray analysis found genes of the SpeB operon to be the primary target of RopB regulation. These data show that an intact RopB and efficient SpeB production are necessary for systemic infection with GAS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of c-Jun in angiogenesis and cancer: insights using gene targeting approaches</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guishui, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most common causes of death worldwide. Angiogenesis plays a critical role tumourigenesis and atherogenesis. As a member of the basic region-leucine zipper protein family, c-Jun, has been linked with cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. However, the relationship between c-Jun and angiogenesis has not been firmly established.  In this thesis, strategies targeting c-Jun mRNA such as DNAzyme and siRNA have been designed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the c-Jun mRNA and c-Jun protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These agents block c-Jun expression and inhibit DNA binding activity of c-Jun. Luciferase assay showed that c-Jun siRNA suppressed c-Jun/AP-1-dependent reporter activity. The processes of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation were all down-regulated after treatment with c-Jun targeting agents. In vivo, c-Jun DNAzymes and siRNA inhibit angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis, including tumour angiogenesis and growth, matrix angiogenesis, corneal angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization. This is mediated, at least in part, by c-Jun siRNA or DNAzyme inhibition of MMP-2 expression.  These findings demonstrate the critical role played by c-Jun in the involvement of neovascularization and suggest that DNAzymes or siRNAs are efficient gene-silencing agents. The ability to identify and control key genes in angiogenesis provides opportunities for developing therapeutic molecular tools to treat cancer or other angiogenesis related diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Angiography</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc oxide TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) and polycrystalline silicon thin-films for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Song, Dengyuan, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films are very promising for application in photovoltaics. It is extremely challenging to develop cheap TCOs and poly-Si films to make photovoltaic devices. The aim of this thesis is to study sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO TCO and poly-Si films by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) for application in low-cost photovoltaics. The investigated aspects have been (i) to develop and characterize sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films that can be used as a TCO material on crystalline silicon solar cells, (ii) to explore the potential of the developed ZnO:Al films for application in ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, (iii) to make and characterize poly-Si thin-films on different kinds of glass substrates by SPC using electron-beam evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) [referred to as EVA poly-Si material (SPC of evaporated a-Si)], and (iv) to fabricate EVA poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass and improve the energy conversion efficiency of these cells by post-crystallization treatments. The ZnO:Al work in this thesis is focused on the correlation between film characteristics and deposition parameters, such as rf sputter power (Prf), working gas pressure (Pw), and substrate temperature (Tsub), to get a clear picture of film properties in the optimized conditions for application in photovoltaic devices. Especially the laterally non-uniform film properties resulting from the laterally inhomogeneous erosion of the target material are investigated in detail. The influence of Prf, Pw and Tsub on the structural, electrical, optical and surface morphology properties of ZnO:Al films is discussed. It is found that the lateral variations of the parameters of ZnO:Al films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering can be reduced to acceptable levels by optimising the deposition parameters.  ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabricated ZnO:Al films for application in heterojunction solar cells. In this application, expensive indium-tin oxide (ITO) is usually used. Under the standard AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2, 25 ??C), the best fabricated cell shows an open-circuit voltage of 411 mV, a short-circuit current density of 30.0 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 66.7 %, and a conversion efficiency of 8.2 %. This is believed to be the highest stable efficiency ever reported for this type of cell. By means of dark forward current density-voltage-temperature (J-V-T) measurements, it is shown that the dominant current transport mechanism in the ZnO:Al/c-Si solar cells, in the intermediate forward bias voltage region, is trap-assisted multistep tunneling. EVA poly-Si thin-films are prepared on four types of glass substrates (planar and textured glass, both either bare or SiN-coated) based on evaporated Si, which is a cheaper Si deposition method than the existing technologies. The textured glass is realized by the UNSW-developed AIT process (AIT = aluminium-induced texture). The investigation is concentrated on finding optimized process parameters and evaluating film crystallization quality. It is found that EVA poly-Si films have a grain size in the range 0.8-1.5 ??m, and a preferential (111) orientation. UV reflectance and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a high crystalline material quality, both at the air-side surface and in the bulk. EVA cells are fabricated in both substrate and superstrate configuration. Special attention is paid to improving the Voc of the solar cells. For this purpose, after the SPC process, the samples receive the two post-crystallization treatments: (i) a rapid thermal anneal (RTA), and (ii) a plasma hydrogenation. It is found that two post-crystallization treatments more than double the 1-Sun Voc of the substrate-type cells. It is demonstrated that RTA improves the structural material quality of the cells. Furthermore, a hydrogenation step is shown to significantly improve the electronic material quality of the cells. Based on the RTA???d and hydrogenated EVA poly-Si material, the first mesa-type EVA cells are fabricated in substrate configuration, by using sputtered Al-doped ZnO as the transparent front contact. The investigation is focused on addressing the correlation between the type of the substrate and cell performance. Optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the devices are characterized. It is found that the performance  of EVA cells depends on the glass substrate topography. For cells on textured glass, the AIT texture is shown to have a beneficial effect on the optical absorption of EVA films. It is demonstrated that a SiN barrier layer on the AIT-textured glass improves significantly both the crystalline quality of the poly-Si films and the energy conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells. For cells on planar glass, a SiN film between the planar glass and the poly-Si film has no obvious effect on the cell properties. The investigations in this thesis clearly show that EVA poly-Si films are very promising for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">thin films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deconstructing the racialisation experience of Asian Australians: process, impact and response</field><field name="creator">Hollero, Maria Elisa, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study uses racialisation as a lens to understand the racist experiences of ordinary Asian Australians. It examines the racialisation processes underlying these experiences and explores the strategies employed to respond to and mitigate the impact of being racialised. It addresses the need to develop the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of racialisation and anti-racism in light of the dearth of research work on these especially in Australia.  Different elements from various theories were drawn to frame the empirical investigation since no single theory was adequate as anchor for this qualitative study. In-depth interviews and focus groups with 64 Asian Australians generated rich narratives that provided interesting insights on the personal, political, and spiritual dimensions of human experience that connect the lives of racialised subjects.  Deconstructing stories of racialised subjects laid bare the essence of racist experiences by revealing insights into when and how race becomes a salient signifier of difference. Racialisation provides a productive way of understanding racist experiences since it allows for the unpacking of the multi-layered linked processes of racial categorisation, racial differentiation and problematisation, marginalisation and exclusion, inferiorisation and devaluation. These processes are ordinarily part of the experiences of minority people. They constitute what can be called 'everyday racialisation'.  The study uses stress-coping theory to examine the long-term and cumulative impact of being part of a racialised group. It shows how exposure to racism stressors has multifarious effects on the health and well-being of racialised subjects. The everyday racialisation of minority groups affects their socio-psychological functioning and limits the life chances and economic opportunities available to them.  In addition, the study demonstrates how Asian Australians cope with the stress of their everyday racialisation by drawing from their personal repertoire of discursive, cognitive and behavioural strategies. These, in combination with outside support mechanisms, make up what can be termed ?everyday anti-racism? strategies. Racialisation provides valuable insights into when, how and why racialised subjects deploy these different strategies to negotiate, contest and bridge the constraints and boundaries imposed on them.  The study offers an integrated model for understanding racialisation experience and lays the foundation for developing further the concepts of  'everyday racialisation' and 'everyday antiracism'.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Ethnic identity -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Race relations -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons</field><field name="creator">Fedorow, Heidi, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark polymer pigment present in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Interest in this pigment has rekindled in recent years because of a hypothesised link between NM and the especial vulnerability of NM-containing neurons to cell death in Parkinson???s disease (PD). Many aspects of the biology of NM are yet to be characterised. It is not known if NM like the similar melanin of the skin is synthesised via an enzymatic pathway or solely through autoxidation as has traditionally been thought. Examination of the ultrastructure of NM granules showed that in contrast to peripheral melanosomes, an electron-lucent lipid component was present that represented 30% of pigment volume. The identity of the lipid component of NM has remained unclear since it was first suggested that NM contained lipid in the 1960???s. NM lipid was biochemically isolated from the substantia nigra of 32 human brains. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry and 1H- and 13C NMR techniques, it was shown for the first time that the NM lipid is the polyisoprenoid dolichol. The age-related development and regulation of NM has not previously been described. Optical density and area measurements of unstained NM in ventral substantia nigra neurons spanning the ages of 24 weeks to 95 years old demonstrated three developmental phases. NM was not present at birth and initiation of pigmentation began at approximately 3 years of age, followed by a period of increasing pigment granule number and colouration until age 20. In PD brain, the ultrastructure of NM demonstrated that the amount of lipid did not change. However, filipin staining showed a reduction of cholesterol in PD NM containing neurons. In addition, immunogold staining of ??-synuclein demonstrated that this protein redistributed to the NM lipid in PD brain. The finding of phases in the development of NM, and the identification of lipid species in NM suggest that NM biology is regulated. This thesis has also demonstrated changes in the lipid and associated proteins in PD, suggesting NM???s chemical composition alters which may have functional consequences that contribute to PD.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of climate anomalies and variability of Southern Ocean water masses on interannual to centennial time scales</field><field name="creator">Santoso, Agus, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study the natural variability of Southern Ocean water masses on interannual to centennial time scales is investigated using a long-term integration of the Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) coupled climate model. We focus our attention on analysing the variability of Antarctic IntermediateWater (AAIW), Circumpolar DeepWater (CDW), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). We present an analysis of the dominant modes of temperature and salinity (T - S) variability within these water masses. Climate signals are detected and analysed as they get transmitted into the interior from the water mass formation regions. Eastward propagating wavenumber-1, -2, and -3 signals are identied using a complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis along the core of the AAIW layer. Variability in air-sea heat uxes and ice meltwater rates are shown by heat and salt budget analyses to control variability of Antarctic Surface Water where density surfaces associated with AAIW outcrop. The dominant mode in the CDW layer is found to exhibit an interbasin-scale of variability originating from the North Atlantic, and propagating southward into the Southern Ocean. Salinity dipole anomalies appear to propagate around the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation with the strengthening and weakening of North Atlantic Deep Water formation. In the AABW layer, T - S anomalies are shown to originate from the southwestern Weddell Sea, driven by salinity variations and convective overturning in the region. It is also demonstrated that the model exhibits spatial patterns of T - S variability for the most part consistent with limited observational record in the Southern Hemisphere. However, some observations of decadal T - S changes are found to be beyond that seen in the model in its unperturbed state. We further assess sea surface temperature (SST) variability modes in the Indian Ocean on interannual time scales  in the CSIRO model and in reanalysis data. The emergence of a meridional SST dipole during years of southwest Western Australian rainfall extremes is shown to be connected to a large-scale mode of Indian Ocean climate variability. The evolution of the dipole is controlled by variations in atmospheric circulation driving anomalous latent heat uxes with wind-driven ocean transport moderating the impact of evaporation and setting the conditions favourable for the next generation phase of an opposite dipole.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climatic changes -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Ocean-atmosphere interaction -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rattus tanezumi in the upland rice terraces of Banaue, Philippines: demography, habitat use, crop damage and yield assessment.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Rachel Weslie, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rodents cause significant damage to agricultural crops throughout the world, including rice, the staple food for the increasing population of Southeast Asia. Little is known about the ecology of pest rodent species, resulting in much effort being concentrated on ineffective, time consuming control practices. This research was designed to understand the demography and habitat use of the major pest rodent (Rattus tanezumi) of the Banaue rice terraces in order to identify the most efficient time and location to undertake pest control. Rodent crop damage and associated yield loss was also assessed in order to provide information for a cost : benefit analysis of rodent control practices. And the beliefs, perceptions and practices of Banaue rice farmers were investigated to assist in identifying future compatible rodent control programs. Replicated cage trapping was undertaken for a twelve month period over the entire rice cropping season in two study sites in the Municipality of Banaue Philippines. The breeding season of R. tanezumi corresponded with periods of food availability from the transplanted to ripening stages of the rice crop. A non-breeding season occurred from the fallow to seedling stages. The distinct breeding season occurred within the rice fields and adjacent village and scrub habitats. Radio-tracked and spool-and-line tracked R. tanezumi moved from adjacent habitats into the rice field during the breeding season, and individuals persisted in all habitat types, including the rice field, during the fallow, nonbreeding season. Overall rice yield was significantly greater (43%) in areas where rodents were excluded by fencing compared to areas where rodents were not excluded. More rodent damage to rice tillers occurred at the booting than at the ripening stage of the rice crop. These results suggest that to prevent rodent damage, control should be undertaken at the end of the R. tanezumi non-breeding season (prior to transplanting), before rodent numbers multiply and crop damage occurs. Further, the cost-benefit analysis of non-chemical rodent control programs in Banaue, suggests that benefits accrue once yield loss is likely to exceed 5%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philippines.</field><field name="subject">Rattue tanezumi.</field><field name="subject">Rodent damage.</field><field name="subject">Rodents -- Control.</field><field name="subject">Agricultural pests.</field><field name="subject">Demography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematic analysis of the upper limb during anatomical and functional movements in healthy children</field><field name="creator">Dwan, Leanne Nicole, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Impairments of upper limb function can negatively impact an individual???s ability to carry out everyday tasks. Children with cerebral palsy can have limitations of upper limb movement due to physiological and structural changes in their body. Current treatment regimes for children with upper limb involvement of cerebral palsy are assessed using a variety of qualitative assessment tools. These measures rely on subjective input from the assessor, and can be insensitive to significant functional improvements.  Research methods in upper limb motion analysis are developing towards use as clinical tools. To date, there is a paucity of knowledge on the quantitative measures of range of motion (ROM) and function of upper limbs in healthy children. There is also lack of agreement on repeatable functional tasks of the upper limb for 3D measurement. The identification of a repeatable task in healthy children would facilitate the use of upper limb 3D motion analysis to guide clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.  This thesis aims to describe upper limb joint range of movement in each degree of freedom and present normative three dimensional kinematic data of upper limb movement in healthy children during a repeatable upper limb functional task. This will provide a basis for comparison to children with movement disorders for future research and clinical practice.  The UNSW kinematic upper limb model was found to successfully measure three dimensional upper limb anatomical and functional movements in healthy children. Normative kinematic data are reported for anatomical movements and two functional tasks.  The results of the studies undertaken showed that differences in dominant and non-dominant limbs were present during anatomical and functional movements. Joint angles measured were found to be repeatable in healthy children. The results suggest that methods used were reliable for investigating upper limb kinematics. Functional movement time-series data were found to be repeatable for the group with the exception of wrist flexion/extension during the hand to mouth movement for both the dominant and non-dominant limbs.  These findings improve current knowledge on upper limb kinematics in healthy children. This knowledge can assist the investigation of movement disorders in children to facilitate clinical decision making.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functional</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Upper Limb</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contrast</field><field name="creator">Pursell, Finn, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages the contrast phenomenon in its various manifestations across the different sense modalities in order to assess the plausibility of contrast as a general perceptual principle. There is some question as to whether contrast may spill over into modalities it is not commonly associated with. In particular, a number of researchers have argued that contrast occurs in audition and has similarities to the brightness contrast illusion in visual perception. For example, studies of noise pitch have noted similar psychophysical properties to brightness contrast and invoked the same underlying neural mechanism. Furthermore, there is some suggestion that contrast may come in a non-simultaneous form characterised by perceptual exaggerations arising from the contrasting spectral content of successive auditory stimuli. The speech perception literature on context effects are engaged as it is in this domain that there is some evidence for non-simultaneous contrast. A study was conducted in which 34 subjects were presented synthesized tokens of "da" and "ga" diotically and dichotically following the precursors "al" and "ar". Significantly more "da" identifications were observed (F=62.85, p=.000) following "ar" precursors when stimuli were presented diotically, whereas no significant effects were observed in identifications of the target for different precursors (F=.553, p=.457) when targets were presented to the ear contralateral to that of the precursor. Results fail to support an explanation of the context effect in the form of a causal mechanism with a central locus. Rather, the locus of the context effect can only be hypothesized to occur at the periphery of the nervous system. This suggests that auditory contrast may be a plausible explanation for the context effect, and which if correct, may be a universal phenomenon common to all people regardless of environment and acquired knowledge. Given these results, contrast is explored more broadly. As generic use of the term is often encountered in musical contexts, aspects of music perception relating to contrast are examined. Some theoretical ideas are put forward in this capacity, focusing on an interactive neural network approach to understanding hypothetical structural contrasts, including tonal contrasts. The thesis closes with a consideration of contrast-like effects that may be of some relevance towards understanding contrast more generally.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geophysical and hydrogeological assessment of the interaction of saline and fresh groundwater near a tidal creek</field><field name="creator">Dasey, Gregory R, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Through the application of downhole logging techniques an innovative assessment of density dependent groundwater flow has been undertaken that highlights the limitations of water level measurements for assessing groundwater flow in coastal environments. The method utilises an EM39 bulk conductivity log to calculate fluid conductivity/fluid density that was then used to convert measured point water head to freshwater head/environmental head to improve the understanding of groundwater flow at the creek. This method of assessing density dependent flow is unique and has not previously been demonstrated. The converted water levels showed that interpretation of groundwater flow is critically dependent on a detailed knowledge of both head and density. An assessment of the potential error in the conversion process indicated that, for the low gradients at the study site, misinterpretation of flow could occur due to errors inherent in the process. As a result, it is recommended that pressure transducers and loggers be used to monitor pressure in variable density systems so that Darcy???s equation can be used directly to calculate groundwater flow and direction. The thesis also presents the results of high-resolution geophysical mapping of the distribution of saline groundwater beneath a tidal creek. The mapping was used to develop a detailed conceptual model of the salinity distribution at a tidal creek that included: the presence of saline intrusion beneath the creek; saline groundwater overlying fresh groundwater due to surface flooding in extreme tide events; concentrated discharge of groundwater (comprised of brackish water due to mixing in the aquifer) at the creek banks; and, significant changes in the distribution of saline groundwater according to rainfall events and only minor changes over a tidal cycle. The conceptual model, geophysical site assessment, water level analysis and numerical modelling represents a multi-disciplinary approach to the assessment of the interaction of saline and fresh groundwater that has not previously been undertaken. Significant anisotropy was inferred from geophysical observations that indicated vertical flow in the borehole annulus. This observation is particularly significant and implies that even relatively short (1.0 to 2.0 m) screened wells may not yield accurate fluid conductivity and head values in variable density systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geophysics</field><field name="subject">Coastal</field><field name="subject">Hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">Density Dependent</field><field name="subject">Resistivity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond needs-based health funding: resource allocation and equity at the state and area health service levels in New South Wales - Australia</field><field name="creator">Kirigia, Doris Gatwiri, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Addressing inequities in health both within and between countries has attracted considerable global attention in recent years. In theory, equity remains one of the key policy objectives of health systems and underpins the allocation of health sector resources in many countries. In practice, however, current evidence demonstrates that only limited progress has been made in terms of bridging the health inequity gap and improving the health of the least advantaged. The persistence of inequities in health and health outcomes raises concerns about how governments and health authorities distribute limited health resources to improve the health of the poor and most vulnerable and thereby promote equity. This thesis is about equity and allocation of financial resources in the health system of New South Wales, one of the eight states of Australia. It investigated the extent to which there has been a movement towards equity in resource allocation to Area Health Services under the NSW Health Resource Distribution Formula and whether this has been reflected in equitable resource allocation within Area Health Services. It considered only resources allocated through the NSW Department of Health. The study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to gather and analyse data. The qualitative component analysed data gathered through semi&#150;structured interviews with policy makers, health executives, managers, and other stakeholders to establish the resource allocation processes and the factors upon which the allocation decisions were based. The quantitative component analysed health expenditure and health needs data to assess the extent to which allocation of resources from the State to Area Health Service levels has been equitable in terms of reflecting the level of health needs. Two indices were constructed and used as proxies for health needs. Principal component analysis was used in the construction of one of the indices, using demographic, socio&#150;economic and health-related data. The other index was developed using a combination of premature mortality and morbidity data. The quantitative study spans the two decades 1989/90 to 2006/07, with a more detailed analysis of material for the years 2003/04 to 2006/07. The findings of the study show a considerable degree of inequity in resource allocation with several Area Health Services (AHSs) receiving less than a fair share of funding for the years analysed, although some movements towards equity were evident. This contradicts the general impression that the introduction of the resource distribution formula in NSW has significantly improved equity in resource allocation. In general, funding allocation at the State level correlated significantly with population size but not with health needs of the eight AHSs in NSW. Similarly, within the AHSs, allocation of funds was based on programs and services and not on health needs. Key issues that emerged from the qualitative data as affecting the equity with which health funds are allocated in the NSW health system include limited use of the resource distribution formula at the state level, lack of an effective resource allocation tool to guide the distribution of funds within AHSs, and insufficient emphasis on equity at the AHS level. It is crucial that these and several other issues identifies in the study are addressed if current inequities in funding and in health outcomes generally are to be effectively reduced.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disadvantaged population groups</field><field name="subject">Resource Allocation</field><field name="subject">Equity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mouse mammary tumour virus - like virus in hormonally influenced human tissues</field><field name="creator">Johal, Harpreet , Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The identification of Mouse Mammary Tumour Virus (MMTV) as the causal factor for breast cancer in mice, initiated investigation into a viral cause for human breast cancer. MMTV-like virus has been detected in human breast cancers, lymphomas and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), suggesting the virus is not restricted to human breast cancers. We hypothesized that the virus is detected in human tissues influenced by steroid hormones. We detected a region of the envelope (env) gene of MMTV-like virus in 53/210 (25%) of liver disease, 4/21 (19%) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 14/89 (16%) of ovarian cancer, 53/147 (36%) of prostate cancer, 5/50 (10%) of endometrial cancer and 13/141 (9%) of skin cancer samples but not in lung cancers (0/51). Viral env DNA was also detected in 4/81 (5%) of placentae and 5/90 (6%) of breast milk cells from healthy women whilst viral env RNA was detected in 2/90 (2%) of breast milk supernatants and (0/81) placentae. Immunohistochemistry staining for the presence of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-??) and progesterone receptor (PgR) demonstrated a significant association between ER-??/PgR and MMTV-like virus in human ovarian, prostate, endometrial and skin cancers though no significant association was observed between ER-??/PgR and the virus in liver tissues. We were also unable to demonstrate a significant association between accumulation of p53 tumour suppressor protein and MMTV-like virus in liver disease and HCC. Despite the demonstration of viral env integration in genomic DNA from human placentae using Southern Blots, other regions of the virus were not detected following PCR attempts with published primer sets. This study adds to the current knowledge of distribution of MMTV-like virus in humans. The detection of the virus in hormonally influenced human tissues (positive for ER-?? or PgR) indicates an association between MMTV-like virus and steroid hormones in some human tissues. The detection of the virus in placentae and breast milk also suggests potential routes of transmission of the virus in humans. Although the exact role of the virus in these tissues is not known, the presence of the virus together with other genetic alterations and/or the influence of steroid hormones could be involved in the transformation of various human tissues (i.e.pathogenesis).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PgR</field><field name="subject">MMTV</field><field name="subject">ER-??</field><field name="subject">p53</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Driving preferences for co-branded products: effects of extendibility, compatibility and uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Lin, Song, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Firms frequently use brand extension strategies to enter new product categories. Another type of entry strategy is co-branding by effectively exploiting the equity of both constituent brands. Co-branding may effectively drive consumer preferences if consumers believe the combination of two brands offers a better solution than either one separately. However, there is also the risk that consumers may get confused with the combination, or have perceptions of strengths regarding one of the brands diluted, leading to the failure of this strategy. While much has been written on brand-category extension, despite its prevalence, the use of co-brands to enter a new category has attracted relatively little attention. In this study, the author models the effects on consumer perceptions and preferences of combining two brand names for a new product. The proposed model provides a mechanism to represent how consumers&#146; prior attribute beliefs about constituent brands, the extendibility of the brands into the extension category, the compatibility between the constituent brands, and the uncertainty associated with them can jointly determine their preferences for the co-branded product. The contribution that this model enables is a means to study co-branding and new category entry simultaneously, by assessing the drivers of consumer preference for a co-brand in a new product category. An empirical study is designed to test the model, using real brands and hypothetical extensions and co-brands. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New product</field><field name="subject">Co-branding</field><field name="subject">Brand extension</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the mechanism of action of the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin: drug-DNA interactions in reconstituted chromatin and human gene expression profiling</field><field name="creator">Galea, Anne Marie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The DNA-damaging compound, cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum (II)), is a highly successful anti-tumour agent widely used in the treatment of a range of human cancers. Despite the clinical efficacy of cisplatin, its curative potential is largely restricted by the occurrence of drug resistance and several dose-limiting toxic side effects. Attempts to ameliorate these deficiencies have met with limited success. However, it is ultimately hoped that such efforts will benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which cisplatin elicits tumourspecific cytotoxicity. The overall aim of this project was to further elucidate the mechanism of action of cisplatin. For this purpose, different experimental approaches were employed to examine the interaction of cisplatin with DNA, and the drug???s effect on human gene expression. Firstly, chromatin structures native to DNA in human cells were simulated in vitro via reconstitution techniques. Their effect on cisplatin-mediated DNA damage could then be evaluated. Various cisplatin analogues and other DNA-damaging compounds were also investigated in this model system. Secondly, the transcriptional response of human cells to cisplatin treatment was analysed using microarrays and gene expression profiling techniques. Transcript profiles compiled for cisplatin and its clinically ineffective isomer, transplatin, were compared to establish a possible relationship between compound-specific responses and therapeutic efficiency. To assess the relative influence of individual chromatin elements on cisplatin- DNA interactions, the first part of this study employed the octamer transfer method of nucleosome reconstitution to create a defined experimental construct. Standard footprinting techniques allowed the precise location of two positioned nucleosomes to be established with respect to the DNA sequence. The construct was then subjected to drug treatment and the resulting DNA damage was quantitatively analysed using a Taq DNA polymerase stop assay. At sites of damage, densitometric comparisons between purified and reconstituted DNA were used to evaluate the influence of nucleosomal core proteins on specific drug-DNA interactions. For cisplatin and most of the other DNAdamaging agents studied, this method revealed regions of the construct that were relatively protected from drug-induced damage. These regions corresponded to the sites  of the positioned nucleosome cores and indicated that the preferred site of DNA binding for these compounds was in the linker region of the construct. Statistical analyses confirmed the significant level of damage protection conferred by the nucleosome cores and exposed subtle differences between the agents examined. Most prominent among the trends observed, was the negative correlation between compound size and the relative propensity for damaging nucleosomal core DNA. Larger compounds generally displayed a greater tendency to target the linker region of the nucleosomal DNA. In contrast, the access of smaller molecules was not impeded as significantly. In the second stage of the project, the effect of cisplatin on human gene expression levels was described using 19000-gene microarrays and transcription profiling methods. In cultured human cells, cisplatin treatment was shown to significantly up- and down-regulate consistent subsets of genes. Many of these genes responded similarly to treatment with transplatin, the therapeutically inactive isomer of cisplatin. However, a smaller proportion of these transcripts underwent differential expression changes in response to the two isomers. Some of these genes may constitute part of the DNA damage response induced by cisplatin that is critical for its anti-tumour activity. Ultimately, the identification of gene expression responses unique to clinically active compounds, like cisplatin, could thus greatly benefit the design and development of improved chemotherapeutics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cisplatin</field><field name="subject">Human genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent drill wear condition monitoring using self organising feature maps</field><field name="creator">Ashar, Jesal</field><field name="description">The rising demand for exacting performances from manufacturing systems has led to new challenges for the development of complex tool condition monitoring techniques. Although a wide range of monitoring methods have been investigated and developed, there has been very little migration of these innovations into industrial practice. The principal factor behind this phenomenon is the stochastic nature of the environment in which the system must function. A truly universal application has yet to be developed. The work presented here centres around the application of an unsupervised neural network model to the said problem. These networks learn without the aid of a human teacher or supervisor and learn to organise and re-organise themselves in accordance to the input data. This leads to the network structure reflecting the given input distribution more precisely than a predefined model, which generally follows a decay schedule. The dynamic nature of the process provides an evaluation of the underlying connectivity and topology in the original data space. This makes the network far more capable of capturing details in the target space. These networks have been successfully used in speech recognition applications and various pattern recognition tasks involving very noisy signals. Work is in progress on their application to robotics, process control and telecommunications. The procedure followed here has been to conduct experimental drilling trials using solid carbide drills on a Duplex Stainless Steel workpiece. Duplex Stainless Steel was chosen as a preferred metal for drilling experiments because of this high strength, good resistance to corrosion, low thermal expansion and good fatigue resistance. During the drilling trials, forces on the workpiece along the x, y and z axes were captured in real time and moments of the forces were calculated using these values. These three axial forces, along with their power spectral densities and moments were used as input parameters to the Artificial Neural Network model which followed the Self-Organising Map algorithm to classify this data. After the network was able to adapt itself to classify this real world data, the generated model was tested against a different set of data values captured during the drilling trials. The network was able to correctly identify a worn out drill from a new drill from this previously unseen set of data. This autonomous classification of the drill wear state by the neural network is a step towards creating a &#8220;universal&#8221; application that will eventually be able to predict tool wear in any machining operation without prior training.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SOFM</field><field name="subject">Drill wear</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cycling in the City of Unley : does rhetoric match reality?</field><field name="creator">Kirby, Stewart.</field><field name="description">Thesis (MRegionalUrban Planning)--University of South Australia, 2003.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bicycle trails</field><field name="subject">Cycling</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79062</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor receptors in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Brierley, Gemma Victoria</field><field name="description">The IGF system is a crucial regulator of normal growth and development, however dysregulation of the system on multiple levels is associated with the incidence of a wide variety of malignancies including the breast, thyroid, lung, and colon, making the IGF system an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. Due to its role in mediating cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis, traditional focus has been set on examining the role of the type 1 IGF receptor [IGF1R] in cancer. However there is mounting evidence to suggest the insulin receptor [IR] may also be involved in the potentiation and pathogenesis of cancers. The observation that IGF-II is overexpressed, compared to normal tissues, by cancers suggests signaling via target receptors by this ligand has important implications on cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, both the IGF1R and IR have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in a variety of malignancies. In regards to IR isoform, the IGF-II binding IR-A is preferentially expressed by a number of cancer cell types. Together with the observation that an autocrine proliferative loop exists between IGF-II and the IR-A in malignant thyrocytes and cultured breast cancer cells, suggests signaling via the IR-A may play a role in cancer cell growth and survival. However, very few studies on the IR-A have been conducted in cells co-expressing the IGF1R. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with discrimination between signaling arising from IGF1R homodimers, IR-A homodimers, and IGF1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. It is not known how the IR-A interacts, and functions in conjunction with the other receptors of the IGF system to signal biologically relevant outcomes, especially in terms of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to block and down-regulate the IGF1R. Current anti-cancer therapies targeting the IGF system have concentrated on blocking IGF signaling via the IGF1R, due mostly to the functional properties of the receptor, but also in part due to the metabolic consequences associated with blockade and inhibition of the IR. This individual targeting of the IGF1R potentially leaves a pathway by which IGF-II secreted by the tumour can circumvent current IGF1R based therapies. Consequently, this thesis investigated whether the IR-A could compensate for the targeted loss of the IGF1R and how the IR-A interacts with the IGF1R in cells co-expressing these two receptors. In addition, the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation was assessed. The main experimental techniques used throughout this body of work included; assessment of protein expression and activation by Western blot, siRNA mediated gene silencing, and measures of cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The key areas of investigation included: 1. Investigation of the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation 2. Identification of an appropriate cell line model in which to investigate the interactions between the IR-A and IGF1R 3. Optimisation of siRNA mediated knock-down of the IR-A and IGF1R in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells 4. Determination of the biological role of the IR-A in SW480 cells co-expressing the IGF1R The key findings from this work included: 1. The IR-A could not compensate for IGF1R depletion in SW480 cells 2. Dual silencing of the IR-A and IGF1R indicated signaling via the IGF1R was dominant to signaling via the IR-A in SW480 cells 3. Signaling via IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors may not be as potent as signaling via IGF1R homodimers 4. IGF-I at physiological concentrations can stimulate biological responses via both isoforms of the IR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factors; cancer; colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell receptors.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tartaric acid biosynthesis in plants.</field><field name="creator">DeBolt, Seth</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

This species is highly susceptible to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wilt nematode, which is not found in Australia. Potentially pathogenic nematodes were isolated from several dead Pinus trees in Williamstown, Heidelberg and Knoxfield, suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria in 2000-2002. A survey of the above-ground nematode fauna of Pinus and other conifers in south--eastern Australia was undertaken. Stands of Pinus were surveyed in the Kuipto Forest and the South-East Region of SA; the south-west and the Gippsland region of Victoria; and the Hume region in NSW; and native Callitris preissii was sampled in the Murray Mallee. A total of 1140 samples from P. radiata, 50 from P. pinaster and 40 from C. preissii were examined. No nematodes were found in wood or young shoots of conifers except in the wood samples from diseased trees at Knoxfield and Heidelberg in Victoria. In contrast, nematodes were common in the bark samples of healthy trees. Morphologically, extracted nematodes were classified into five trophic groups, including: aphelenchida (plant, fungal and lichen feeders), rhabditids and areolaimids (bacterial feeding), Macrolaimus spp. (saprophagus), tylenchids (plant feeding), and dorylaimids (bacterial and algal feeders). Aphelenchids were the most commonly found trophic group. Three genera and twelve morphospecies of aphelenchids were identified. Eight species of Laimaphelenchus and one putative species of Acugutturus appear to be new records for Australia. Descriptions of two new species, L. preissii and L. australis have been published. Three species of Aphelenchoides were also found. No Bursaphelenchus spp. were found. Molecular studies included sequencing of the ITS region of Laimaphelenchus preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, and Aphelenchid H1; D2D3 fragments of 28S and 18S of L. preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, and Aphelenchid H1, Laimaphelenchus australis, and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg; and COI of three aphelenchid morphospecies L. preissii, Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg and Aphelenchid K1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Laimaphelenchus spp. are new species and that the unknown aphelenchids are close to Aphelenchoides. None of the six isolates studied from Australia was close to Bursaphelenchus. Population growth and mean doubling time of L. preissii, Aphelenchid K1 and Aphelenchid H1 were studied at different temperatures and on different food resources. The different species had markedly different population growth rates, which were significantly affected by temperature and food. A study on desiccation was carried out with L. preissii and morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, Aphelenchid H1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg. Ability to survive desiccation varied between species, and the recovery rate of the different species was significantly different. A pathogenicity study was performed using young P. radiata trees in a shadehouse. No symptoms were observed following inoculation with Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, Aphelenchid H1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg isolated from diseased P. radiata in Victoria, or L. preissii from native Callitris in South Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-throughput assays for biotin protein ligase: a novel antibiotic target.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Belinda Ling Nah</field><field name="description">Antibiotics are defined as chemical substances that inhibit or limit the growth of microorganisms. Since the second world war, antibiotics have been widely used to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with serious bacterial infections caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, it has become increasingly difficult to treat bacterial infections due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. The first clinical case of drug resistant bacteria was observed in S. aureus in 1947, just four years after the mass production of penicillin. Since then, resistance has been reported to every antibiotic ever employed. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, more than 70% of hospital-acquired infections show resistance to at least one commonly used antibiotic. Coupled with the paucity of therapeutic agents in the pipeline, there is now an urgent demand for new antibiotics. One of the strategies employed to combat drug resistant bacteria requires new chemical entities that work through novel drug targets for which there is no pre-existing resistance. This thesis focuses on the essential metabolic enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) as one such new drug target. BPL is the enzyme responsible for covalently attaching the cofactor biotin prosthetic group onto the biotin-dependent enzymes such as the carboxylases, decarboxylases and transcarboxylases. Enzymatic biotinylation proceeds via a two-step reaction whereby biotinyl-5'-AMP is synthesized from biotin and ATP before the biotin moiety is transferred onto the side chain of one specific lysine present in the active site of the biotin-dependent enzyme. One example of an important biotin-dependent enzyme is acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Through genetic studies, it has been demonstrated that BPL activity is essential for bacterial survival. The aim for this project was to develop a convenient, high-throughput assay to measure BPL activity. This assay would permit 1) quantitative kinetic analysis of ligands and inhibitors and 2) screening of compound libraries for new BPL inhibitors. We propose that BPL inhibitors can be developed into new antibiotic agents. The novel BPL assay was developed employing fluorescence polarization (FP). FP is a light based technique which uses plane polarized light for the detection of tumbling motion of fluorescent molecules in solution. As polarization of the emitted light is relative to the apparent molecular mass of the fluorophore, this technique can be use for quantitation of changes in molecular mass of target molecules. This enabled 1) rapid kinetic analysis, 2) a minimal number of handling steps, 3) no washing steps and 4) automation by robotics. A first generation assay was developed for Escherichia coli BPL using peptide 85-11 that has been shown to be a convenient substrate. Following the BPL reaction, biotinylated peptides will form large molecular mass complexes with avidin. The amount of product could then be quantitated using FP. Here, kinetic analysis of MgATP (Km 0.25 &#177; 0.01 mM) and biotin (Km 1.45 &#177; 0.15 &#956;M) binding produced results consistent with published data. We validated this assay with inhibition studies with end products of the BPL reaction, AMP and pyrophosphate, and a compound, biotinol-5'-AMP. Statistical analysis, performed upon both intraassay and interassay results (n = 30), showed the coefficient of variance to be &lt;10% across all data sets. Furthermore, the Z' factors between 0.5 and 0.8 demonstrated the utility of this technology in high-throughput applications. However, the use of peptide 85-11, a substrate specific to E. coli BPL, does limit the application of this methodology to E. coli. In the second generation FP assay, I adapted this technology for S. aureus BPL by employing the biotin domain of S. aureus pyruvate carboxylase. Insertion of a fluorescein label was achieved by first engineering a cysteine residue into the domain by site directed mutagenesis then incubation with fluorescein-5'-maleimide. A series of mutants was created to investigate optimal positioning of the label into the substrate. Furthermore, the minimal size of the functional domain was determined. Our data showed that the placement of the fluorescein label is an important aspect of this project. Using this approach, I identified that a 90 amino acid domain with the label at position 1134 was optimal. Kinetic analysis of ligand binding showed SaBPL had a Km for biotin at 3.29 &#177; 0.37 &#956;M and Km for MgATP at 66 &#177; 16.08 &#956;M. This was in good agreement with data obtained from our previous assay measuring &#179;H-biotin incorporation. Inhibitor studies with pyrophosphate and analogues of biotin and biotinyl-5'-AMP further validated the assay. Various studies have shown cross-species biotinylation activities by a diverse range of BPLs. Therefore, using this methodology with a biotin domain as the substrate potentially provides a convenient assay for all BPLs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biotin protein ligase; fluorescence polarization; enzyme assay; high-throughput compound screening</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grapevine root hydraulics: the role of aquaporins.</field><field name="creator">Vandeleur, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Hydraulic conductance of roots of the grapevine cultivar, Chardonnay, varies diurnally, peaking at 1400 h. The diurnal amplitude of hydraulic conductance between 600 and 1400 h was not altered when potted grapevines were water-stressed by withholding water for 8 days. However, the diurnal change was greatly reduced for water-stressed Grenache. If the diurnal change in root hydraulic conductance is a result of changes in aquaporin gene expression or activity, it suggests that aquaporins respond differently in water-stressed Chardonnay and Grenache roots. Both Chardonnay and Grenache demonstrated a reduction in hydraulic conductance in response to water stress, with Grenache exhibiting a larger reduction. Suberisation of the roots increased in response to water stress, with complete suberisation of the endodermis occurring closer to the root tip of Grenache compared to the more drought sensitive Chardonnay. The drought sensitive rootstock, 101-14 (V. riparia &#215; V. rupestris) demonstrated a similar reduction in hydraulic conductance to Chardonnay, while drought tolerant 1103 Paulsen (V. berlandieri &#215; V. rupestris) had a non-significant reduction when water-stressed compared to the large reduction observed for drought tolerant Grenache. Therefore, in this study the degree of reduction in hydraulic conductance did not relate to the drought tolerance of the four varieties examined. The impact of partial drying (watering only half the root system) on hydraulic conductance also differed between Chardonnay and Grenache. There was no change in the conductance of the whole root system of Chardonnay due to an increase in conductance of the roots in the wet half which compensated for the reduction on the dry side. In contrast, Grenache did suffer a reduction measured over the whole root system due to a much larger reduction on the dry side compared to Chardonnay. There was an increase in hydraulic conductance on the wet side but this could not compensate for the large reduction on the dry side. Two aquaporins (VvPIP1;1 and VvPIP2;2) were cloned from the roots of grapevine cultivar Chardonnay. The genes were expressed in Xenopus oocytes to determine their osmotic permeability. As has been shown in a number of plant species, VvPIP1;1 was only slightly permeable to water, whereas VvPIP2;2 did transport water. However, when VvPIP1;1 was injected into the oocytes with VvPIP2;2, there was a substantial increase in the osmotic permeability. There was no significant variation in the diurnal expression of VvPIP2;2, whereas VvPIP1;1 showed a peak in expression at 1000 h prior to the peak in hydraulic conductance and peaked again at 1800 h. VvPIP2;2 did not vary in transcript level in response to water stress or rewatering in Chardonnay or Grenache roots. The level of VvPIP1;1 doubled in water stressed Chardonnay roots and declined again when the vines were rewatered 24 h previously. This response to water stress did not occur in Grenache roots. The roots used were from the apical 5 cm. Similar roots were used to measure the water permeability of the cortical cell membranes using the cell pressure probe. Changes in cell membrane permeability in response to water stress corresponded to changes in VvPIP1;1 expression. An experiment to determine if shoot topping had an effect on root hydraulic conductance revealed a significant 50% decline. This response was also observed in soybean (Glycine max L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). A range of experiments have been performed to determine the reason for the decline. Possibilities included a response to final leaf area and reduced transpirational demand; loss of a carbohydrate sink; or hormonal signals such as abscisic acid, auxin and ethylene. At this stage the nature of the positive or negative signal that causes the change in root hydraulic conductance remains elusive. However, the signal did cause a reduction in the transcript level of VvPIP1;1, indicating the involvement of aquaporins in the response. The root hydraulic conductance of grapevines is variable and dependent on factors such as time of day, water-stress, transpiration rate and unknown signals from the shoot. A proportion of this variability is due to changes in aquaporin number or activity. There are also genotypic differences which may be beneficial for future breeding efforts to improve water use efficiency of grapevines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydraulic conductance; aquaporins; roots; grapevine; water stress</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture.</field><field name="subject">Grapes.</field><field name="subject">Aquaporins</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast-food consumption: application and extension of the theory of planned behaviour to incorporate affective responses and implicit associations.</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Kirsten</field><field name="description">The consumption of energy-dense fast foods has been implicated as a causal factor in the development of obesity. The development of strategies to modify food choice behaviour requires an understanding of both the behaviour and the influencing factors (in particular, beliefs, attitudes, and social influences). The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1988) is one of the most widely used and accepted models of the intention-behaviour relationship within the health literature (Bagozzi, Wong, Abe, &amp; Bergami, 2000; Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998; Sheppard, Hartwick, &amp; Warshaw, 1988; Sutton, 1998). This thesis spans three studies, applying and extending the TPB to examine factors influencing fast-food consumption in an Australian population. The first study is a qualitative analysis examining components of the belief stage of the TPB, including behavioural outcome, normative, and control beliefs in relation to frequent fast-food consumption. Aside from details of these beliefs, which were used to develop a quantitative measure for application in the second study, the key outcomes of this study were a definition of fast food which was applied throughout each of the studies, clarification of how fast food fits within Australian lifestyles, and generation of additional information regarding other possible influences on fast-food consumption beyond those addressed by the TPB. The additional variables included for examination were affective responses to fast food, individual differences in sensitivity to reward, and the extent to which both consideration of the future consequences of frequent fast-food consumption and fear of being negatively evaluated are influential on consumption rates. The second, quantitative study applied both the TPB-based instrument developed from findings of the first study as well as the four additional measures with the aim of improving the explanatory ability of the TPB in terms of fast-food consumption. Structural equation modelling was used and although the model performed well overall, explaining up to 50% of the variance in both intention and behaviour, there were some variables that did not perform strongly. In particular, the measure of affective responses captured with a semantic differential scale was not significantly predictive, and the third study was designed and conducted to test the performance of a more sophisticated measure in the hope that implicit, in addition to explicit, responses would provide greater explanatory value. The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998; Greenwald, Nosek, &amp; Banaji, 2003) is said to provide some insight into more implicit attitudes by measuring the degree to which an individual associates conceptual categories through response latencies (or timed responses) whilst opportunities for introspection are minimised. Some have also suggested that the IAT may contribute well when it is combined with other measures, particularly in the prediction of behaviour, choice, or judgement (Brunel, Tietje, &amp; Greenwald, 2004). Therefore, the third study combined measures based on the TPB with the IAT to investigate the nature of both implicit and explicit beliefs underlying attitudes towards fast foods. Overall, the associations captured by the IAT did not help to explain a great deal of variance in fast-food consumption, although there were differences in associations according to stimulus type with arousal-related stimuli generating stronger results than valence-related stimuli. Differences in associations with fast food were also found across groups divided according to Body Mass Index, with overweight people demonstrating more positive associations than either normal weight or obese people. A summary discusses the potential application of the findings in the development and implementation of future intervention and obesity prevention strategies as well as directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of planned behaviour; fast-food; Implicit Associations Test; beliefs; attitudes; affect; food choice</field><field name="subject">Health behavior.</field><field name="subject">Social psychology.</field><field name="subject">Convenience foods.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of mineral and bone metabolism in the systematic response to neurotrauma of adult males with spinal cord injury.</field><field name="creator">Clark, Jillian Mary</field><field name="description">Biochemical assays and radioabsorptiometry evaluated the relationship of mineral and bone metabolism to the systemic response to neurotrauma or orthopaedic trauma of adult males. Forty-one adult males (29.4&#177;9.3 years) participated of which 37 had a primary diagnosis of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and four were vertebral fracture controls. Biochemical abnormalities found included hyperphosphataemia, in association with low or low normal serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitmain D (1,25(OH)&#8322;D) and of parathyroid hormone (PTH), whilst patients remained normocalcaemic. These disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone were strongly associated with the interval since injury and the severity of injury, but none of these relationships was correlated with the level of the injury, the sensory status of a patient or the presence of spine fracture. The disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone found in this study are a mirror image of the data of patients with the heritable disorders autosomal dominant hyperphosphataemic rickets (ADHR), which results from an inactivating mutation of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and autosomal recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (ARHR), which is caused by a mutation of the gene encoding dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1). It is potentially important that the hormone/proteolytic enzyme/extra-cellular matrix protein cascade associated with these disorders is counter-regulated by 1,25(OH)&#8322;D, acting either directly or indirectly. The present results suggest that the serum levels of 1,25(OH)&#8322;D of the neurotrauma patients chosen for study may have been inappropriately high with respect to the &#8220;physiological and metabolic set&#8221; of serum levels of phosphate and ionised calcium in the period corresponding to the uncoupling of the resorption and formation of bone, at least in males, prompting further investigation. The findings are consistent with a new &#8220;physiological set,&#8221; possibly involving an abnormality in the synthesis or processing of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors or other circulating phosphatonins, which may act as an additional level of regulation of the renal&#8211;bone axis, rather than renal failure. Strongly supporting this was the dynamic pattern of the biochemistry and radiological data of these neurotrauma patients and also, preliminary evidence of disturbances in circulating levels of other systemic modulators of mineral and bone metabolism. The relationships that were observed potentially may be explained by the diversity of the physiological activities of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors and the modes of actions of secreted FGF23 in bone. The findings provide an understanding of why bone loss occurs and may form the target for safe and cost effective interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spinal cord injury; osteoporosis; bone mineral density; vitamin D metabolism; phosphate metabolism</field><field name="subject">Nervous system Wounds and injuries Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genome damage and folate nutrigenomics in uteroplacental insufficiency.</field><field name="creator">Furness, Denise Lyndal Fleur</field><field name="description">Pregnancy complications associated with placental development affect approximately one third of all human pregnancies. Genome health is essential for placental and fetal development, as DNA damage can lead to pregnancy loss and developmental defects. During this developmental phase rapid DNA replication provides an increased opportunity for genome and epigenome damage to occur[1]. Maternal nutrition is one of the principal environmental factors supporting the high rate of cell proliferation and differentiation. Folate functions in one-carbon metabolism and regulates DNA synthesis, DNA repair and gene expression[1]. Deficiencies or defects in gene-nutrient interactions associated with one-carbon metabolism can lead to inhibition of cell division, cell cycle delay and an excessive apoptotic or necrotic cell death rate [2], which may affect placentation. This study is the first to investigate the association between genomic damage biomarkers in late pregnancy complications associated with uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The results indicate that genome damage in the form of micronucleated cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes at 20 weeks gestation is significantly increased in women at risk of developing an adverse pregnancy outcome. The observed OR for the high micronuclei frequency may be the highest observed for any biomarker selected in relation to risk of pregnancy complications to date (15.6 &#8211; 33.0). In addition, reduced apoptosis was observed in association with increased micronuclei, suggesting that the cells may have escaped specific cell-cycle checkpoints allowing a cell with DNA damage to proceed through mitosis. This study demonstrated that an increase in plasma homocysteine concentration at 20 weeks gestation is associated prospectively with the subsequent development of UPI, indicating a causal relationship. The MTR 2756 GG genotype was significantly associated with increased plasma homocysteine concentration and UPI. Furthermore, the MTHFD1 1958 single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with increased risk for IUGR.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">uteroplacental insufficiency; pre-eclampsia; IUGR; one-carbon metabolism; DNA damage; folate</field><field name="subject">Placenta Diseases.</field><field name="subject">Nutrition Genetic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of cotton boll wall-specific promoters.</field><field name="creator">Lightfoot, Damien James</field><field name="description">The cotton boll contains the seeds of the plant to which long, white fibres are attached. The cotton industry takes advantage of these fibres to spin yarns for textile production. A major challenge facing the cotton industry is that of crop loss to insect attack. The primary insect pests of cotton preferentially attack the boll, causing damage to the commercially important fibres. The recent introduction of Bt-transgenic varieties, containing genes with anti-pest properties from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, has had positive impacts on pest control and pesticide usage. These transgenes are under control of constitutive promoters, resulting in endotoxin expression in all parts of the plant. This constant high level transgene expression may have several detrimental effects, such as placing strong selective pressure on pest populations to develop resistance, non-target effects of the transgene on other organisms, a yield penalty to the plant, and the presence of transgenic protein in secondary commercial products. For these reasons, this project aims to identify promoters that could be used for tissue-specific expression of anti-pest molecules in only the boll wall of the plant. A differential screening approach was used to identify several boll wall-specific mRNAs and the temporal and spatial abundance of these transcripts was determined using Northern analysis. The promoters corresponding to these transcripts were identified using Genome Walker&#174; PCR and isolated from genomic DNA by PCR. Transient transformation of various cotton tissues with these promoters driving reporter expression resulted in predominant boll wall expression. The cotton promoters identified here provide an alternative tool to constitutive promoters for use in future transgenic varieties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cotton, Promoters (Genetics)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epigenetic regulation and inheritance of autonomous seed development in apomictic Hieracium.</field><field name="creator">Rodrigues, Julio Carlyle Macedo</field><field name="description">Apomixis is an intriguing and agronomically valuable asexual reproductive pathway resulting in seeds that give rise to plants that are identical in genotype to the female parent. Apomixis is absent in agriculturally important seed crops and our work has focused on the analysis of apomixis in the daisy-like genus Hieracium which contains sexual and apomictic species. Prior studies have shown that apomixis in Hieracium is controlled by two dominant loci. The LOA controls the avoidance of meiosis during female gametophyte (embryo sac) formation and the LOP locus is required for fertilization independent embryo formation during seed initiation. The genes conferring apomixis are unknown. In this study we focused on the events of autonomous seed initiation. Cytological examination of apomictic mutants that have lost LOA or LOP and analysis of their progeny enabled us to characterize developmental aspects associated with the function of these loci. Upon removal of LOA meiosis occurs normally and LOP segregates with a 1:1 ratio in the progeny, characterizing maternal gametophytic control. We also show that autonomous embryo formation segregates with autonomous endosperm formation, suggesting that these two loci are closely linked. However, upon meiotic division, embryo lethal components arise and embryo development in apomeiosis mutants was generally defective and seed set was low. Similarly, upon removal of LOP, apomixis initiation occurs normally and unreduced embryo sacs can only form seeds if pollinated. Autonomous seed initiation is actively repressed in the sexual model plant Arabidopsis by the action of a chromatin remodelling complex encoded by the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-class genes. These genes are homologues of the Drosophila PcG complex that also repress gene expression throughout Drosophila development. Mutations in the FIS-class genes lead to elements of apomixis, such as autonomous endosperm, and in one particular mutant, autonomous egg cell development. Given the similarity in apomictic and FISclass gene mutant phenotype we isolated three homologues from sexual and apomictic Hieracium plants: FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1) AND RETINOBLASTOMA (RBR). FIS-class genes from sexual and apomicit Hieracium and examined their expression, interaction and function during seed initiation. The isolated Hieracium FIS-class genes were highly conserved in sexual and apomictic plants in terms of gene sequence and temporal and spatial expression pattern. Analysis of protein interactions by yeast-two hybrid showed that the HFIE gene from sexual and apomictic plants does not interact with other complex members in the same manner found in Arabidopsis. Protein modelling uncovered structural differences between the Arabidopsis and Hieracium FIE proteins. RNAi- mediated down-regulation of HFIE in sexual Hieracium did not lead to autonomous seed initiation indicating HFIE was not part of a repressive complex. Down-regulation of HFIE in sexual and apomictic plants revealed the gene was essential for embryo growth and viability. Therefore, FIS-complex genes interact differently in Arabidopsis and Hieracium and have different developmental roles. In summary, the results presented here suggest that the FIS-genes are not mutated in apomictic Hieracium plants, but they interact differently relative to the Arabidopsis counterparts and play a fundamental role in embryogenesis. Thus, engineering autonomous seed into crops will not depend on mutating these genes but rather in uncovering the molecular signal that triggers apomictic development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apomixis; Hieracium; epigenetic; autonomous seed</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pivotal role of insulin-like growth factors in pregnancy success.</field><field name="creator">Sferruzzi-Perri, Amanda Nancy</field><field name="description">Appropriate placental development in early gestation is essential for subsequent placental function and hence optimal fetal growth and pregnancy outcome. Placental insufficiency has been implicated in common disorders of pregnancy, which result in fetal and maternal mortality or morbidity, and also increase the risk of poor health in adult offspring. Prior to the onset of maternal blood flow to the placenta at ~10 weeks of gestation, placentation occurs in a relatively hypoxic environment, which is essential for healthy pregnancy. IGF-II is abundantly expressed by the invasive trophoblast and may interact with oxygen to regulate placentation. Additionally, maternally-derived IGFs may act on the placenta and the mother to regulate fetal growth. This thesis investigated the role and interaction of oxygen and IGF-II on human placental outgrowth during early pregnancy in vitro. Furthermore, the impact of maternal IGF treatment during early to mid pregnancy, on placental development and substrate transfer, nutrient partitioning between the mother and fetus, and fetal growth, were also determined in mid and late gestation in guinea pigs. We have demonstrated, using human early first trimester placental villous explants, that IGF-II mediates the effect of hypoxia on placental outgrowth. Culture of placental explants in hypoxia, or with exogenous IGF-II, enhanced trophoblast outgrowth and inhibited TGF-&#946;1 activation, a negative regulator of trophoblast function. In addition, culture of explants in hypoxia induced Igf2 gene expression in outgrowing trophoblast, without altering Upar, Igf1r, Igf2r or Tgf&#946;1 transcription. We propose that this novel interaction of oxygen, IGF-II and TGF-&#946;1 during pregnancy is an important determinant of placental development. Furthermore, we showed that exogenous IGF-II stimulates villous explant trophoblast outgrowth in placenta from &gt;10 weeks gestation, suggesting that IGF-II may be a potential therapeutic agent to enhance placental growth. In guinea pigs, maternal treatment with IGF-I or IGF-II, in early to mid pregnancy, has sustained anabolic effects on fetal growth, enhanced fetal survival and increased placental delivery, and fetal and maternal utilization of, glucose and amino acids near term. These effects were also evident by mid gestation following earlier IGF-I treatment. Despite these similar pregnancy outcomes, there were IGF specific effects on the placenta and mother, suggesting that IGFs may mediate some of their effects via different pathways. IGF-I administration severely reduced maternal adiposity in late pregnancy, elicited its effects by substantially improving development of the placental exchange region, which correlated with placental function. We have suggested that the discrete effects of IGF-I and IGF-II stem from distinct interactions of the IGFs with various receptors. Maternal administration of an analogue of IGF-II that selectively interacts with IGF2R (Leu &#178;&#8311;-IGF-II), revealed that many of the effects of IGF-II treatment, were mediated by IGF2R, while IGF-I presumably acts through IGF1R. Together, this work has highlighted the major and somewhat complementary roles of maternal IGFs during the first half of pregnancy, in regulating placental development, fetal growth and pregnancy success. Importantly, it indicates the potential use of maternal IGFs in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to pregnancy complications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Somatomedin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of novel vaccine strategies for duck Hepatitis B virus infection.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Darren Scott</field><field name="description">Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a life-threatening pathogen with major economic significance. Acute infection in adults is common, albeit usually self-limiting. Importantly, infection in infants typically results in chronic infection and increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, the infectious carrier state is perpetuated in chronically infected individuals. Successful immuno-therapeutic vaccination would reduce the incidence of chronic infection and of HCC as well as reduce transmission of the disease. Recovery from acute and chronic HBV infection typically occurs in the presence of robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses (CMI), whereas these responses are low or absent in chronically HBV-infected individuals. Therefore, it was hypothesised that effective stimulation of both humoral and CMI responses, in conjunction with currently available antiviral therapies, may contribute significantly to development of vaccines for treatment of chronic HBV infection. The duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model of HBV infection was used to test novel vaccine strategies that could complement existing antiviral therapeutic approaches to treat chronically HBV-infected humans. To this end, three separate vaccine studies were conducted to investigate potential therapeutic regimes. Methods to assess the efficacies of the vaccine strategies included immunoperoxidase detection of viral antigen and immune cell markers within the liver and development of sensitive assays to monitor levels of DHBV DNA, duck hepatitis B virus surface antigen (DHBsAg), antibodies to duck hepatitis B core (anti-DHBc) and surface antigens (anti-DHBs) in serum were developed and validated which allowed monitoring of the kinetics of the humoral immune response following vaccination and the course and outcome of experimental DHBV infection. The first vaccine study tested the protective efficacy of DNA vaccines encoding either the small form of DHBsAg (DHBs) protein or the larger antigen (DHBpre-S/S), These were administered to ducks at day 4 and 14 of age. On the same day as the second vaccination, ducks were challenged intravenously with DHBV. Immunoperoxidase staining of biopsy tissue collected at day 4 p.i. showed significant decreases in the number of DHBV infected hepatocytes in ducks receiving the DNA vaccines compared to the mock-vaccinated control ducks. Significant protection against development of chronic DHBV infection was observed in ducks vaccinated with DNA vaccines expressing either pre-S/S or S protein. Although anti-DHBs antibodies were not detected prior to DHBV challenge, the decrease in the percentages of DHBV-infected hepatocytes at day 4 p.i is suggestive that neutralisation of the inoculum by low-level anti-DHBs antibodies in cohort with CMI responses induced by vaccination were the most probable mechanisms of action. The second vaccine study examined the protective efficacy of a novel whole-cell vaccine that expressed the DHBV core antigen (DHBcAg). Ducks were vaccinated on day 4 and 14 of age and DHBV challenge was administered 4 days later. Detectable anti-DHBc antibodies were generated as soon as 4 days after the initial vaccination suggesting that this regimen elicited increased immunogenicity than vaccination with DNA vaccines alone. In contrast to the first vaccine study with DNA vaccines expressing DHBsAg, no significant differences in the percentage of DHBV-infected hepatocytes were observed in biopsy tissue collected at day 4 p.i.This finding is confirmation that anti-DHBc antibodies were not neutralising to the initial DHBV inoculum. However, significant protection against development of chronic DHBV infection was observed in the whole-cell vaccinated ducks suggesting that the mechanism of protection was consistent immune-mediated killing of DHBV-infected hepatocytes following CMI responses to determinants of DHBcAg. The final vaccine study involved a combination strategy of antiviral drug Entecavir (ETV) and prime-boost vaccination with DNA vaccines and recombinant fowlpoxvirus (rFPV) expressing DHBV antigens. Immediately following DHBV infection, ducks were dosed by oral gavage with the antiviral drug Entecavir (ETV) and at the same time received the priming DNA vaccines encoding DHBV antigens. Seven days later the boosting vaccination consisting of recombinant fowlpox viruses (rFPV) also expressing DHBV antigens was administered. Extraordinary protection was observed, with 100% of ducks given combination therapy rapidly resolved their DHBV infection while 100% of non-treated ducks developed chronic infection. It was concluded that protection resulted from a combination of at least three factors. First, reduction and control of DHBV levels with the aid of ETV; secondly, stimulation of surface antigen-specific humoral immune responses resulting in neutralisation of newly produced virions; and finally, the combined up-regulation of CMI responses against DHBV core and surface antigens, resulting in elimination of infected hepatocytes. The four manuscripts that comprise this thesis provide insights into the viral kinetics and immune responses that follow DHBV infection and/or vaccination of ducks. The results provide new directions for future vaccine studies aimed at developing effective treatments for chronic HBV infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B; duck; vaccines</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis, Viral Immunological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Vaccines.</field><field name="identifier">http://proxy.library.adelaide.edu.au/login?url= http://library.adelaide.edu.au/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=1318773</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor-II and its role in blastocyst development, implantation and placentation.</field><field name="creator">Pringle, Kirsty Gay</field><field name="description">Impaired implantation and placental development have been implicated in several disorders of pregnancy such as unexplained miscarriage, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation. Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF)-II has previously been shown to promote blastocyst development and placental growth and function. We were interested in how IGF-II interacts with other factors throughout blastocyst development, implantation and placentation in the mouse to improve pregnancy outcome. In vitro embryo culture increases the risk of pregnancy complications associated with poor placentation. Recent research has focussed on optimising the culture conditions to more resemble that of the in vivo environment. IGF-II, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator (uPA) and Plasminogen individually have all been shown to be important for embryo development. However, it is likely that a combination of factors is required to counteract the negative effects of in vitro culture. Here we show that IGF-II, uPA and Plasminogen, in combination, significantly improve mouse blastocyst hatching rates and implantation rates on day 8 and doubles the number of mothers that are pregnant after embryo transfer. Following implantation, IGF-II is suggested to play a role in promoting placental development and function. We demonstrate that IGF-II is co-localised with both IGF receptors throughout early pregnancy in trophoblasts and in the developing blood vessels and adjacent stromal cells in the mesometrial decidua. This suggests that IGF-II may play a role in both decidual angiogenesis and placentation. We suggest that perhaps murine trophoblasts secrete molecules such as IGF-II to promote angiogenesis in the decidua early in pregnancy to compensate for their shallow invasion and allow for adequate trophoblast remodelling later in pregnancy. The first trimester human placenta experiences a low oxygen environment. The Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) mediate the response to low oxygen, inducing genes such as IGF-II. Currently, the role of oxygen in mouse placentation, the mechanisms by which HIFs promote placentation or their interaction with IGF-II in the placenta is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the early mouse implantation site is exposed to low oxygen levels similar to those seen in humans and expresses HIF-1&#61537; protein. We were interested then in the interaction between IGF-II, oxygen and HIFs in trophoblasts in vitro. Prolonged exposure to low oxygen reduced trophoblast outgrowth, and increased Tpbp mRNA levels, suggesting commitment to the spongiotrophoblast lineage. Interestingly, we found that antisense (as) Hif-1&#61537; may mediate the response to prolonged hypoxia in murine trophoblasts. Importantly, Hif-1&#61537; and Hif-2&#61537; were differentially regulated by oxygen and IGF-II in cultured trophoblast cells suggesting a novel interaction between IGF-II and oxygen. In conclusion, it appears that IGF-II is a central growth factor which interacts with other molecules to regulate a wide variety of process in early pregnancy to promote blastocyst development, implantation and placentation. The results outlined in this thesis demonstrate a novel interaction between IGF-II, uPA and Plasminogen in promoting blastocyst development and implantation which may be used to improve pregnancy outcome following ART. In addition, we have also identified a novel interaction between IGF-II, oxygen and the HIF system which may regulate trophoblast function. This has important implications not only for placental research, but also for cancer research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factor-II; hypoxia inducible factor; placenta; blastocyst; implantation; oxygen</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of water stress-induced xylem embolism in two grapevine cultivars, Chardonnay and Grenache, and the role of aquaporins.</field><field name="creator">Shelden, Megan Cherie</field><field name="description">Aquaporins (AQP) are membrane bound proteins that facilitate the movement of water and other small neutral solutes across cellular membranes. Plant aquaporins belong to a large family of highly conserved proteins called the Membrane Intrinsic Protein (MIP) superfamily. In many plant species the expression of aquaporin genes and their regulation has been linked to water stress. Grapevines respond to water stress with a variety of physiological mechanisms, including the susceptibility to xylem embolism. The formation of embolised vessels can lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity of the xylem. Recently, it has been hypothesised that aquaporins may contribute to the water movement required for embolism recovery of xylem vessels thus restoring the hydraulic pathway. Molecular and physiological techniques have been combined to study the putative role of plasma membrane and tonoplast membrane aquaporins in response to water stress induced xylem embolism in two cultivars of grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay and Grenache). Water-stress induced cavitation was measured in the stems and petioles of pot grown grapevines of a drought tolerant (Grenache) and a drought sensitive variety (Chardonnay) by the detection of ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAEs) over both a drying and diurnal cycle. Vulnerability curves were generated by correlating the UAEs with the leaf water potential (&#968;L). Varietal differences in cavitation vulnerability and hydraulic properties were observed. Grenache was more susceptible to water-stress induced xylem embolism than Chardonnay, and displayed a higher hydraulic capacity (measured by maximum hydraulic conductivity). This is most likely due to anatomical differences of the xylem vessels. Chardonnay displayed vulnerability segmentation, with cavitation occurring first in the petiole and later in the stem, before developing into &#8220;runaway&#8221; cavitation under severe water stress. Vulnerability segmentation was not observed in Grenache, with both petioles and stems equally vulnerable to the formation of xylem embolism. Under severe water stress, Grenache did not develop runaway cavitation indicating that they must have some mechanism to prevent the onset of runaway cavitation. To determine the role of aquaporins, candidate genes were identified, by screening a Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon cDNA library, for aquaporin cDNAs encoding members of the Plasma membrane Intrinsic Protein (PIP) and Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein (TIP) subfamilies. The screen resulted in the identification of 11 full-length and two partial aquaporin cDNAs. Sequence analyses of these cDNAs reveal five are homologous to PIP2 aquaporins, six to PIP1 and two to the TIP aquaporins. Functional expression of the fulllength AQP cDNAs in Xenopus oocytes showed PIP2 members have significantly higher water permeability compared to PIP1 aquaporins. VvPIP2;1 showed very high water permeability which was reduced by acidic cytosolic pH, as has been reported for other members of the PIP2 family. Transcript analysis of some of these aquaporin genes provides preliminary evidence that aquaporins may contribute to differences in the hydraulic response of these two grapevine varieties to conditions of water stress.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; aquaporin; water stress; cavitation; xylem embolism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-incompatibility of olive.</field><field name="creator">Seifi, Esmaeil</field><field name="description">The olive (Olea europaea L.) is one of the most ancient fruit trees and has been cultivated for its oil in the Mediterranean area for thousands of years. Today, the consumption of olive oil and table olives is increasing both in traditional producing countries and the entire world. Most olive cultivars are self-incompatible and do not produce a commercial yield after self pollination. In this thesis, inflorescence architecture and sexual compatibility relationships of some olive cultivars, and gene expression in olive pistils during flowering were studied. To study the inflorescence architecture of olive, 45 inflorescences in each of the cultivars Manzanillo, Mission, and Frantoio were checked every morning from flower opening to petal fall. The flower position on the inflorescence had a highly significant effect on the opening day in all cultivars. Terminal flowers and the flowers located on the primary branches opened earlier than flowers located on the secondary branches. Flower position also had a highly significant effect on gender in Manzanillo and Mission. In Manzanillo, the secondary branches had fewer perfect flowers than the primary branches. In Mission, the secondary branches had no perfect flowers at all. In Manzanillo, perfect flowers had significantly longer petal persistence than staminate flowers. To study flower competition within the inflorescence, the distal halves, on which the flowers tend to be perfect, of 120 inflorescences in three trees of Manzanillo were removed about one month before full bloom. This resulted in a highly significant increase in the percentage of perfect flowers on the proximal halves. The effects of shoot orientation and inflorescence location on inflorescence characteristics in the cultivars Frantoio, Kalamata, and Koroneiki were also studied. For each cultivar, inflorescence characteristics in three sections of shoots (top, middle, and base) and four sides of the three selected trees (north, south, east, and west) were recorded. The statistical analysis showed that basal inflorescences were shorter and with fewer flowers but with the same percentage of perfect flowers. Shoot orientation did not have any influence on these characteristics in any of the cultivars. Sexual compatibility was assessed using two methods. In the first method, controlled crossings were performed in the cultivars Frantoio, Koroneiki, and Kalamata. The pistils were harvested one week after hand pollination and stained with 0.1% aniline blue. The styles and ovules were separated, mounted in 80% glycerol, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. In Frantoio and Koroneiki, the number of ovules penetrated by a pollen tube was used to estimate the level of sexual compatibility. In Kalamata, the numbers of ovules penetrated by pollen tubes were not significantly different between treatments; therefore, the number of pollen tubes in the lower style was used. All the cultivars studied were self- incompatible. Frantoio (as a host) was incompatible with Koroneiki and Barnea but partially compatible with Mission. Koroneiki (as a host) was incompatible with Barnea but partially compatible with Frantoio and Mission. Kalamata (as a host) was compatible with Barnea, incompatible with Mission and Koroneiki in 2004, but partially compatible with them in 2005. In the second method, eight microsatellite markers were used for genotyping three Kalamata mother trees, 40 embryos per mother tree, and all the potential pollen donors. Genotyping data were analysed using FaMoz software, and the number of embryos assigned to each putative pollen donor was determined. Paternity analysis showed that Kalamata (as a host) was self-incompatible, compatible with Barnea, Benito, and Katsourela, but incompatible with Arbequina, Azapa, and Picual. To study the gene expression in olive pistils during flowering, a genomic approach was initiated using cDNA subtractive array analysis. Total RNA was isolated from olive pistils at two developmental stages, where self-incompatibility (SI) genes are expected to be differentially expressed: 1) small green flower buds (expression of SI genes not expected) and 2) large white flower buds containing receptive pistils just prior to opening (expression of SI genes expected). From each stage, cDNA libraries were prepared and put through forward and reverse subtractive hybridisations to enrich for differentially expressed cDNAs in stage 2. Macroarrays were prepared by printing 2304 differentially expressed cDNAs onto nylon membranes and hybridised with forwardand reverse-subtracted probes. The analysis identified 90 up-regulated cDNA clones highly expressed in receptive pistils. Further subtracted and unsubtracted hybridisations confirmed up-regulation of the majority of these cDNAs. Gene expression profiles across different tissues showed that most of the genes were pistil-specific. The expression pattern of the genes showed high similarity in Kalamata, Frantoio, Barnea, and Pendolino. All the screened genes were sequenced and their similarities were searched in the NCBI database. The most redundant and interesting up-regulated clones were those similar to a receptor protein kinase-like protein. Some versions of this protein play a role in the sporophytic SI system of Brassica and the gametophytic SI system of Papaver and rye.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">olive; self-incompatibility; pollination; inflorescence architecture; paternity analysis; gene expression; pollen tube observation</field><field name="subject">Olive</field><field name="subject">Plant breeding Genetic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and description of Clostridium sp. and metabolic activities in fermentative hydrogen production.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xiaoyi</field><field name="description">Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly and highly efficient energy source. Fermentative hydrogen production is an exciting R&amp;D area that offers a means to produce hydrogen from a variety of renewable resources or even wastewaters. However, the development of fermentative hydrogen production processes has been hampered due to their low yield and relatively high costs. The aim of this thesis was to improve fundamental knowledge of hydrogen-producing bacteria, provide genetic information associated with the hydrogen evolution, and to optimise operating conditions to enhance hydrogen yield. Isolation and identification of hydrogen producing bacteria from activated sludge were conducted using 16S rRNA gene-directed PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone library and heterotrophic plate isolation. The results showed that Clostridium sp. were dominant and active hydrogen producers. For the first time, three hydrogen producers, which harboured the [FeFe] hydrogenase gene, were characterised by 16S rDNA sequencing, and further physiologically identified as Clostridium sp. (W1), Clostridium butyricum (W4) and Clostridium butyricum (W5). The structure of the putative [FeFe] hydrogenase gene cluster of C. butyricum W5 was also described. The changes in [FeFe] hydrogenase mRNA expression of C. butyricum W5 during fermentation were monitored. Statistical analysis showed that both the [FeFe] hydrogenase mRNA expression level and cell growth have positive relationships with hydrogen production. The newly isolated C. butyricum W5 demonstrated highly promising hydrogen fermentation performance and was therefore used as the working strain. Optimization of operating conditions in terms of carbon and nitrogen sources, pH, temperature and inoculum size was carried out in a laboratory scale batch system. Use of molasses and NH&#8324;NO&#8323; resulted in a high hydrogen production yield. Under the optimized fermentation conditions, 100g/L molasses, 1.2g/L NH&#8324;NO&#8323;, and 9&#215;10&#8308; cell/ml initial cell number at 39&#176;C and pH 6.5, a maximum hydrogen yield of 1.85 mol H&#8322;/ mol hexose was achieved. This corresponded to a hydrogen production rate of 17.38 mmol/h/L. Acetic, lactic and butyric acids were found to be the main by-products of the fermentation. The interrelations between the hydrogen yield and other yields of metabolites were statistically analysed corresponding to the variation in operating conditions. The dry cell weight was found to have a power relationship with hydrogen production. The results from this study have provided a better understanding of metabolic processes and gene expression involved in fermentative hydrogen production, and an improved bioengineering process for hydrogen production.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen; fermentation; clostridia;</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction between dietary proteins and resistant starch on large bowel health.</field><field name="creator">Toden, Shusuke.</field><field name="description">A review of the literature revealed that diet plays an important role in serious human noninfectious large bowel diseases including cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases. Dietary protein (especially as red and processed meats) has been implicated as a positive risk factor for colorectal cancer while starch which is not digested in the small intestine (resistant starch, RS) appears to be protective. The series of experiments described in this thesis were aimed to determine the effects of dietary proteins and RS on indices of colon health in an animal model, the laboratory rat. Genetic damage is a prerequisite for carcinogenesis and this was assessed by a specific assay (the comet assay) which gives a measure of DNA strand breaks. Loss of mucus barrier function is thought to contribute to inflammatory bowel disease by permitting bacterial translocation and this was measured optically using a microscope micrometer. Other biomarkers were measured as described below. There were four major experiments. 1. Effects of dietary red meat and casein on colonic DNA damage and interaction with resistant starch Previous studies had shown that higher dietary protein (as casein) induced genetic damage in rat colonocytes and that RS (fed as a high amylose maize starch) was protective. This study was aimed at establishing whether a high protein diet fed as cooked red meat had similar effects and whether RS was protective. Rats were fed diets containing either 15 % or 25% casein or 25% barbecued lean red beef, each with or without 48% high amylose maize starch (as a source of RS) for 4 weeks. As expected, high dietary casein caused a 2-fold increase in colonic single-strand DNA breaks compared with a low casein diet and reduced the thickness of the colonic mucus layer by 41%. High levels of cooked meat caused 26% more DNA damage than the high casein diet but reduced mucus thickness to a similar degree as casein. Addition of RS to the diet abolished the increase in DNA damage and the loss of colonic mucus thickness induced by either high protein diet. It is thought that RS promotes large bowel health through the SCFA produced by the large bowel bacteria. One acid in particular (butyrate) has been associated particularly with promotion of normal large bowel function and protection against disease. In keeping with this hypothesis, caecal and faecal short chain fatty acid pools (including those of butyrate) were increased by inclusion of RS in the diet. DNA damage is an early step in the initiation of cancer and these findings agree with the population data which suggest that total dietary protein and red meat promote risk of colorectal cancer. However, inclusion of resistant starch in the diet could significantly reduce that risk. 2. Differential effects of dietary whey, soy and casein on colonic DNA damage and interaction with resistant starch The preceding experiments showed that high levels of animal-derived proteins increased colonocyte genetic damage and loss of the mucus barrier in rats. This second experiment was designed to determine whether diets high in different types of dairy protein (casein or whey) or a plant protein isolate (soy) had similar adverse effects on colonic DNA and mucus barrier function and whether inclusion of RS in the diet was protective. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 15 % or 25 % casein, whey or soy protein, each with or without 48 % high amylose maize starch for 4 weeks. In confirmation of the earlier studies, higher levels of dietary casein increased colonocyte DNA damage significantly. However, whey did not increase genetic damage. Colonic DNA damage was highest for soy when fed at both 15% and 25% protein in the absence of RS. Inclusion of RS in the diet attenuated colonocyte DNA damage due to higher dietary protein in all three groups. The colonic mucus barrier was thinner in rats fed higher dietary protein but the effect was reversed by feeding RS. Caecal total SCFA and butyrate pools were low in rats fed the digestible starch and were higher in rats fed RS. However, there was no relationship between caecal or faecal SCFA and genetic damage or mucus thickness. Caecal and colonic tissue weight and colon length were higher in rats fed RS, consistent with greater SCFA supply. These data confirm that higher dietary protein of animal (casein) or plant (soy) origin increases genetic damage and loss of the mucus barrier indicating that this is an effect of protein and not its source. These findings accord with the epidemiological data which link dietary protein to greater risk of colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. However, the data show also that dietary proteins differ in their specific actions on genetic damage and mucus thickness. Further, the data from the feeding of whey suggest that not all proteins are equivalent in their capacity to provoke adverse changes in colonic integrity. While the data show that RS raised large bowel and faecal SCFA, they indicate their levels were not related directly to these biomarkers. 3. Dose response effects of resistant starch on protein induced colonic DNA damage The accumulated data linking greater protein intakes to adverse changes in the colon were obtained at dietary levels which were not unreasonable in terms of animal or human consumption. However, the dietary level of RS which were fed were relatively high (48% by weight) so this study was conducted to determine its effectiveness at lower levels of dietary inclusion. It was also important to ascertain whether there was a dose-response relationship between RS intake and the observed effects. One of the mechanisms proposed for the induction of colorectal cancer by high dietary protein intakes is oxidative damage to DNA. In this experiment, this was done by assaying with endonuclease III. Adult male rats were fed a diet containing 25% casein with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% high amylose maize starch for 4 weeks. As in the preceding studies comet tail moment was greatest and the mucus barrier thinnest in rats fed 0% RS. DNA damage was reduced and the mucus barrier thickened in a logarithmic dose-dependent manner by RS. There was no significant difference between dietary groups associated with oxidative DNA damage as measured by endonuclease III. Caecal and faecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) pools rose with the increased level of dietary RS. DNA damage of colonocytes correlated negatively with caecal SCFA but the strongest correlation was with caecal butyrate, which is consistent with the proposed role of this SCFA in promoting a normal cell phenotype. The data show that RS prevents protein induced colonic DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner. Inclusion of 10% high amylose maize starch was found to be sufficient to oppose colonocyte DNA damage, and to increase caecal and faecal SCFA pools. Intakes of this order are not unreasonable in terms of human consumption of RS. 4. Dose response effects of red and white meat on colonic DNA damage and interaction with resistant starch The accumulated evidence from large prospective human studies links diet to colorectal cancer risk strongly. The evidence from the animal studies described in this thesis that dietary protein induces colonocyte genetic damage supports a role for high protein intakes in increasing risk. Recently, several large epidemiological studies and a meta-analysis of prospective studies have found that consumption of dietary red or processed meats, but not white (poultry) meat, is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. This is consistent with the data from the preceding studies that specific proteins affected colonic integrity differentially. A large prospective European study (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) has reported that dietary fibre was protective. The findings reported in this thesis that RS opposes the effects of high dietary protein accord with that conclusion. This study aimed to compare the effects of cooked red (beef) or white (chicken) meat on DNA damage and mucus barrier thickness in rats. The study was designed to determine whether the relationship between the intakes of these meats was dose-dependent. Double-strand DNA breaks are thought to relate more closely to carcinogenesis than single-strand breaks so both were measured. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 15%, 25% or 35% cooked beef or cooked chicken each with or without 20% high amylose maize starch for four weeks. Both red and white meat increased colonic DNA damage dose-dependently. However, both single and double strand breaks were significantly greater when the rats were fed the red meat diets compared to those fed the white meat. Colonocyte DNA damage was reduced by the consumption of RS while large bowel SCFA were increased. The findings of this study are consistent with the epidemiological data which show that red meat consumption is associated with greater risk of colorectal cancer but that white meat is not. Summary The data reported in this thesis support the findings of prospective population studies that high dietary protein, red meat in particular, appears to be harmful to the health of the large bowel. However, the data demonstrate also that different protein types have differential effects on the integrity of the colonocyte DNA. Furthermore, the addition of RS to the diet protects against protein-induced colonic DNA damage and maintenance of the colonic mucus barrier, apparently through increased SCFA production by colonic fermentation. The results of these experiments indicate a strong potential for RS to be effective in maintenance of large bowel integrity in the face of high dietary protein.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dietary protein; resistant starch; bowel health; DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Diseases</field><field name="subject">Intestinal absorption.</field><field name="subject">Diet in disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing overabundant and mobile wildlife: social and institutional dimensions of kangaroo harvest in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Thomsen, Dana Arlene</field><field name="description">In South Australia, overabundant kangaroo populations are managed through commercial harvest. Kangaroo harvest rates over the past decade have averaged only 40% of the harvest quota despite strong demand for the product. With kangaroo populations increasing, the problem of low kangaroo harvest rate in South Australia requires research attention. Previous research regarding kangaroo harvest has focused on questions of biology and ecology and little attention has been directed towards advancing understanding of the human dimensions of kangaroo management. This research sought to fill this gap in knowledge. Qualitative research methods were most appropriate due to the focus on social and institutional dimensions of kangaroo management. Data were collected during interviews with people involved in commercial kangaroo harvest: landholders, harvesters and meat processors. The main topics covered were regnlations and policy, economic issues, the rights and interests of various industry stakeholders and South Australian harvest rates. The views of Aboriginal people were also sought including the significance of kangaroos to Aboriginal people, access to kangaroos for subsistence harvest, kangaroo management and the kangaroo industry. The main findings of this research are presented as a series of peer-reviewed articles: &#8226; Article I introduces the research topic and presents preliminary findings of this study. &#8226; Article 2 establishes that an increase in South Australia's low harvest rate is needed if kangaroo harvest is to make greater contributions to regional communities, and recommends institutional reform to meet this goal. &#8226; Article 3 examines the management regime for kangaroos in South Australia and shows how the informal rules in use are often incongruent with the formal rules established by management administrators. &#8226; Article 4 describes the undervalued position of landholders in the kangaroo industry and the obstacles to landholders deriving income from kangaroo harvest. &#8226; Article 5 discusses the cultural basis of Aboriginal perspectives on kangaroo harvest and includes suggestions for appropriate ways for Aboriginal people to contribute to kangaroo management. The main findings of this research were applied in a comparative study of kangaroo management with that of moose management in Finland. This study found that similar social and institutional factors impact on the management of moose and kangaroos. The broad lessons for wildlife management drawn from the comparative study are: &#8226; mobile wildlife resources require flexible management systems &#8226; stakeholder involvement is critical to management &#8226; hunters/harvesters are conservative of their resource base &#8226; declining harvester numbers need to be addressed through support, incentives and training. These lessons can be applied in part, or in whole, to other overabundant and mobile wildlife species. Thus this thesis makes contribution to kangaroo management by making specific recommendations for the industry, but also contributes to wildlife management in a broader sense through the application of findings to other species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kangaroo harvest; overabundant; mobile; wildlife; management; social; institutional</field><field name="subject">Kangaroos Control South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Kangaroos Management South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Social life and customs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel sensor design for detection of dangerous contaminated marine biotoxins : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Information and Telecommunication Engineering, School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Abdul Rahman, Mohd Syaifudin Bin</field><field name="description">Planar electromagnetic sensing system has been used as one of the NDT methods to evaluate the material properties i.e., to evaluate near-surface properties such as conductivity, permeability and dielectric properties. The applications of planar electromagnetic sensors will depend on both the characteristic of the sensor type chosen and also the characteristic of material under test. Conventional planar interdigital sensors and novel planar interdigital sensors have been designed, fabricated and tested for detection of dangerous marine biotoxins in seafood. Our main objective is to sense the presence of dangerous contaminated acid in mussels and other seafoods. Initial studies were conducted with three peptide derivatives namely Sarcosine, Proline and Hydroxylproline. These three chemicals are structurally closely related to our target molecule (domoic acid). The initial results have shown that all sensors respond very well to the chemicals and it is possible to discriminate the different chemicals from the output of the sensor. Novel interdigital sensors have shown better sensitivity measurement compared to conventional interdigital sensors. The novel interdigital sensors were then being tested with three seafood products. Results from the analysis have shown that novel interdigital sensor with configuration #1 (Sensor_1) has better sensitivity compared to other sensors. Sensor_1 has been chosen for experiment using proline and mussels. The changes in sensor sensitivity were analysed with mussels before and after adding the proline. The presence of proline on the mussel surface and also injected proline to the mussel samples were clearly detected by Sensor_1. Further experiment was conducted with small amount of domoic acid (0.5 &#181;g to 5.0 &#181;g) injected to a mussel and it was found that Sensor_1 was able to detect small amount of domoic acid (1.0 &#181;g) injected into the mussel sample. Sensor_1 was able to detect approximately 12.6 &#181;g/g of domoic acid in mussel meat. Three threshold levels of particular sample thickness have been established for detection of domoic acid. The first prototype of a low cost sensing system known as SIT (Seafood Inspection Tool) has been developed. The outcomes from the experiments provide chances of opportunity for further research in developing a low cost miniature type of sensors for reliable sensing system for commercial use.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planar electromagnetic sensors</field><field name="subject">interdigital sensors</field><field name="subject">seafood toxins</field><field name="subject">peptide derivatives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299903 Biosensor technolgies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The filamin A actin binding domain structure and function: implications for a gain-of-function mechanism for the otopalatodigital syndrome: a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand [Ph.

During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to &#8216;weld&#8217; together with little or no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of &#8216;effective stresses&#8217; that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of drainage, penetrometer resistance was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0.3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect &#8220;Brazilian&#8221; crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; this was not the case for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0.49, 1.47 and 2.47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i.d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced &#8211; that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of &lt; 0.5, 0.5 &#8211; 2, 2 &#8211; 4, and &lt; 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores &#8211; being greater in the &lt; 0.5 mm and &lt; 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0.5 &#8211; 2 mm and 2 &#8211; 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil organic matter and irrigation technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy &#8211; that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs with little or no increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of sodicity of each soil was manipulated by varying the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2mm) above and below a nominal threshold value of 6. Dry aggregates were then packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to wetting near saturation, then draining to a suction of 100 kPa for one week as described above. Measurements were then taken of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength, both of which were affected by ESP in different ways. In the coarse-textured soil, sodicity enhanced aggregate slaking and dispersion, which increased bulk density. While penetrometer resistance also increased, its effect on aggregate coalescence could not be separated from a simple effect of increased bulk density. Similarly, the effect of sodicity on aggregate coalescence in the fine-textured soil was confounded by the higher water contents produced by greater swelling, which produced lower-than-expected penetrometer resistance. Measurements of tensile strength were conducted on air-dry samples, and so the confounding effects of bulk density and water content were eliminated and it was found that tensile strength increased with sodicity in both coarse- and fine-textured soils. The presence of dispersed clay was therefore implicated in the development of aggregate coalescence in this work. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of how the early stages of aggregate coalescence might affect plant growth was attempted using tomatoes (Gross lisse) as a test plant. Seeds were planted in aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 4 mm) of a coarse- or fine-textured soil packed in steel rings. These were wetted at a rate of 1 mm/h to either near-saturation (for maximum coalescence) or to a suction of 10 kPa (for minimum coalescence) and held under these conditions for 24 h. All samples were then transferred to a ceramic pressure plate for drainage to 100 kPa suction for one week. Samples were then placed in a growth-cabinet held at 20C with controlled exposure to 14 h light/day. Germination of the seeds, plant height, and number and length of roots were observed. Germination of the seeds held at near-saturation in both coarse- and fine-textured soils was delayed by 24 h compared with seeds held at 10 kPa suction. Neither the number nor the length of tomato roots differed significantly between the different treatments and soils. In the coarse-textured soil, however, the total root length over a period of 14 days was somewhat greater in the uncoalesced samples than in the coalesced samples, but this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that aside from delaying germination, aggregate coalescence may not have a large effect on early growth of tomato plants. However, this is not to say that detrimental effects may not be manifest at later stages of plant growth, and this certainly needs to be evaluated, particularly because aggregate coalescence increase with repeated cycles of wetting and draining. In conclusion, the primary findings of the work undertaken in this thesis were: &#8226; Rapid wetting of soil aggregates to near-saturation enhanced the onset of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by (in some cases) penetrometer resistance at a soil water suction of 100 kPa, and (in most cases) tensile strength of soil cores in the air-dry state. The rate of wetting appeared to be more important in bringing on aggregate coalescence than how wet the soil eventually became during wetting. This means reducing the rate at which irrigation water is applied to soils may reduce the onset of aggregate coalescence more effectively than controlling the total amount of water applied &#8211; though both are important. The literature reports that aggregate coalescence occurs in the field over periods of up to several months, involving multiple wetting and draining cycles, but the work here demonstrated that this can occur over much shorter time periods depending on conditions imposed. &#8226; Aggregate coalescence occurred in coarse-textured soils regardless of whether the bulk density increased during wetting and draining. In finer-textured soils, the response to wetting conditions varied and was complicated by changes in bulk density and water content due to swelling. &#8226; Small overburden pressures enhanced the onset of aggregate coalescence, but these effects were diminished in the presence of high soil organic matter contents. &#8226; Finer aggregate size distributions (which are often produced in the field by excessive tillage during seedbed preparation) invariably led to greater aggregate coalescence than coarser aggregate size distributions. The effects of aggregate size were mitigated to some extent by higher contents of soil organic matter. &#8226; Sodicity enhanced aggregate coalescence as measured by tensile strength, but when penetrometer resistance was measured in the moist state, the effects were masked to some extent by higher water contents generated by swelling and dispersion. This work suggests that tensile strength (in the air dry state) may be a more effective measure of aggregate coalescence than penetrometer resistance. &#8226; Early plant response to aggregate coalescence was not large, but the response may become magnified during later stages of growth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggregate; bulk density; coalescence; matric suction; organic matter; penetrometer resistance; sodicity; tensile strength; water content</field><field name="subject">Soil structure.</field><field name="subject">Soil penetration test.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of mineral and bone metabolism in the systematic response to neurotrauma of adult males with spinal cord injury.</field><field name="creator">Clark, Jillian Mary</field><field name="description">Biochemical assays and radioabsorptiometry evaluated the relationship of mineral and bone metabolism to the systemic response to neurotrauma or orthopaedic trauma of adult males. Forty-one adult males (29.4&#177;9.3 years) participated of which 37 had a primary diagnosis of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and four were vertebral fracture controls. Biochemical abnormalities found included hyperphosphataemia, in association with low or low normal serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitmain D (1,25(OH)&#8322;D) and of parathyroid hormone (PTH), whilst patients remained normocalcaemic. These disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone were strongly associated with the interval since injury and the severity of injury, but none of these relationships was correlated with the level of the injury, the sensory status of a patient or the presence of spine fracture. The disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone found in this study are a mirror image of the data of patients with the heritable disorders autosomal dominant hyperphosphataemic rickets (ADHR), which results from an inactivating mutation of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and autosomal recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (ARHR), which is caused by a mutation of the gene encoding dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1). It is potentially important that the hormone/proteolytic enzyme/extra-cellular matrix protein cascade associated with these disorders is counter-regulated by 1,25(OH)&#8322;D, acting either directly or indirectly. The present results suggest that the serum levels of 1,25(OH)&#8322;D of the neurotrauma patients chosen for study may have been inappropriately high with respect to the &#8220;physiological and metabolic set&#8221; of serum levels of phosphate and ionised calcium in the period corresponding to the uncoupling of the resorption and formation of bone, at least in males, prompting further investigation. The findings are consistent with a new &#8220;physiological set,&#8221; possibly involving an abnormality in the synthesis or processing of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors or other circulating phosphatonins, which may act as an additional level of regulation of the renal&#8211;bone axis, rather than renal failure. Strongly supporting this was the dynamic pattern of the biochemistry and radiological data of these neurotrauma patients and also, preliminary evidence of disturbances in circulating levels of other systemic modulators of mineral and bone metabolism. The relationships that were observed potentially may be explained by the diversity of the physiological activities of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors and the modes of actions of secreted FGF23 in bone. The findings provide an understanding of why bone loss occurs and may form the target for safe and cost effective interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spinal cord injury; osteoporosis; bone mineral density; vitamin D metabolism; phosphate metabolism</field><field name="subject">Nervous system Wounds and injuries Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of cotton boll wall-specific promoters.</field><field name="creator">Lightfoot, Damien James</field><field name="description">The cotton boll contains the seeds of the plant to which long, white fibres are attached. The cotton industry takes advantage of these fibres to spin yarns for textile production. A major challenge facing the cotton industry is that of crop loss to insect attack. The primary insect pests of cotton preferentially attack the boll, causing damage to the commercially important fibres. The recent introduction of Bt-transgenic varieties, containing genes with anti-pest properties from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, has had positive impacts on pest control and pesticide usage. These transgenes are under control of constitutive promoters, resulting in endotoxin expression in all parts of the plant. This constant high level transgene expression may have several detrimental effects, such as placing strong selective pressure on pest populations to develop resistance, non-target effects of the transgene on other organisms, a yield penalty to the plant, and the presence of transgenic protein in secondary commercial products. For these reasons, this project aims to identify promoters that could be used for tissue-specific expression of anti-pest molecules in only the boll wall of the plant. A differential screening approach was used to identify several boll wall-specific mRNAs and the temporal and spatial abundance of these transcripts was determined using Northern analysis. The promoters corresponding to these transcripts were identified using Genome Walker&#174; PCR and isolated from genomic DNA by PCR. Transient transformation of various cotton tissues with these promoters driving reporter expression resulted in predominant boll wall expression. The cotton promoters identified here provide an alternative tool to constitutive promoters for use in future transgenic varieties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cotton, Promoters (Genetics)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and description of Clostridium sp. and metabolic activities in fermentative hydrogen production.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xiaoyi</field><field name="description">Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly and highly efficient energy source. Fermentative hydrogen production is an exciting R&amp;D area that offers a means to produce hydrogen from a variety of renewable resources or even wastewaters. However, the development of fermentative hydrogen production processes has been hampered due to their low yield and relatively high costs. The aim of this thesis was to improve fundamental knowledge of hydrogen-producing bacteria, provide genetic information associated with the hydrogen evolution, and to optimise operating conditions to enhance hydrogen yield. Isolation and identification of hydrogen producing bacteria from activated sludge were conducted using 16S rRNA gene-directed PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone library and heterotrophic plate isolation. The results showed that Clostridium sp. were dominant and active hydrogen producers. For the first time, three hydrogen producers, which harboured the [FeFe] hydrogenase gene, were characterised by 16S rDNA sequencing, and further physiologically identified as Clostridium sp. (W1), Clostridium butyricum (W4) and Clostridium butyricum (W5). The structure of the putative [FeFe] hydrogenase gene cluster of C. butyricum W5 was also described. The changes in [FeFe] hydrogenase mRNA expression of C. butyricum W5 during fermentation were monitored. Statistical analysis showed that both the [FeFe] hydrogenase mRNA expression level and cell growth have positive relationships with hydrogen production. The newly isolated C. butyricum W5 demonstrated highly promising hydrogen fermentation performance and was therefore used as the working strain. Optimization of operating conditions in terms of carbon and nitrogen sources, pH, temperature and inoculum size was carried out in a laboratory scale batch system. Use of molasses and NH&#8324;NO&#8323; resulted in a high hydrogen production yield. Under the optimized fermentation conditions, 100g/L molasses, 1.2g/L NH&#8324;NO&#8323;, and 9&#215;10&#8308; cell/ml initial cell number at 39&#176;C and pH 6.5, a maximum hydrogen yield of 1.85 mol H&#8322;/ mol hexose was achieved. This corresponded to a hydrogen production rate of 17.38 mmol/h/L. Acetic, lactic and butyric acids were found to be the main by-products of the fermentation. The interrelations between the hydrogen yield and other yields of metabolites were statistically analysed corresponding to the variation in operating conditions. The dry cell weight was found to have a power relationship with hydrogen production. The results from this study have provided a better understanding of metabolic processes and gene expression involved in fermentative hydrogen production, and an improved bioengineering process for hydrogen production.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen; fermentation; clostridia;</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life of a flatfish, the yellowbelly flounder, Rhombosolea leporina G&#252;nther, 1873, in Auckland's sheltered waters</field><field name="creator">Mutoro, David Baraza.</field><field name="description">Rhombosolea leporina G&#252;nther, 1873 is a right-eyed flatfish endemic to New Zealand coastal waters. This study examines this flounder species as an indicator of the importance to fish of the fringe habitats, and its early life stages in those habitats as an indicator of human disturbance. The study was carried out in disturbed areas of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours, and Tamaki Estuary, which have an urban catchment from the Auckland metropolitan city area, and less disturbed areas in the Kaipara Harbour and Waiwera Estuary with rural catchments. Juvenile fish on mud/sand flats were caught by scoopnet and in channels by a dragnet. The adult fish were taken by a setnet. Aging was estimated by use of the otolith. Analysis of the otolith and length relationship shows that R. leporina has a short life span of about four years. This species spends most of its life in shallow water and starts tidal migration during the 1+age. At low tide R. leporina &lt;5cm total length remain on the mud / sand flats, but at localities where there is no standing water this size group occurs along the edge of the retreating tide. Fishes&gt;20cm migrate with the ebb tide to the deeper parts of the channels which in turn lead to the main, deepest channels of the harbour. Length and weight data were used in the analysis of growth of fish from different localities. The Condition Factor index (CF) calculated from length and weight data of juvenile R. leporina reveals that the Manukau Harbour fish are in poorer condition than those of the Waitemata and Kaipara Harbours. Growth estimates by Von Bertalanffy (1938) curves show fast growth in the 1+ and 2+ age groups. The Von Bertalanffy parameters and Walford plots reveal that the female R. leporina may grow larger than the male fish. Sexual maturity is attained at age 2+, females at a length &gt;25cm and males at 22cm.Spawning of this species takes place offshore. Ovary development can be divided into five stages; immature / resting, ripening, ripe, running, and spent. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), founded on ovary development, shows a peak spawning season from winter to spring. GSI is estimated from ovary and fish weight. The juvenile stages of 0+ and 1+ age groups feed on assorted invertebrates. Adults from &gt;20cm length size, the 2+ age group, start to specialise in their diet, mainly feeding on three species of crabs, Halicarcinus cooki, Helice crassa and Macrophthalmus hirtipes. The early life stages of the 0+ and 1+ age groups are protected by the minimum legal size of fish that can be taken commercially not being reached until 2+. This enables the fish to reach adulthood and spawn at least once before being taken. The species grows fast and has high fecundity. The fish collected from the Manukau Harbour are more affected by pollution related diseases than those from the Waitemata and Kaipara Harbours. The sediment and water samples were analysed for heavy metals, organo-chemicals, faecal coliforms and Enterococci coli. Those fish analyzed for heavy metals and organo chemicals had their liver loaded with these toxins more than any other organ or tissue. The Manukau, Waitemata Harbours and Tamaki Estuary are more impacted than the Kaipara Harbour. The other flatfish species caught were Rhombosolea plebeia (Richardson, l842) and Peltorhamphus latus (James, 1972). The Auckland inshore areas are dominated by the juvenile and adult yellow eye mullet Aldrichetta forsteri which occurs throughout the year. The other fish species caught were only present seasonally, particularly from spring to summer. Nineteen other fish species were recorded at the study sites.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern &#8211;how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction and transmission of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Maori folklore</field><field name="subject">Maori stories</field><field name="subject">cognitive models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel sensor design for detection of dangerous contaminated marine biotoxins : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Information and Telecommunication Engineering, School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Abdul Rahman, Mohd Syaifudin Bin</field><field name="description">Planar electromagnetic sensing system has been used as one of the NDT methods to evaluate the material properties i.e., to evaluate near-surface properties such as conductivity, permeability and dielectric properties. The applications of planar electromagnetic sensors will depend on both the characteristic of the sensor type chosen and also the characteristic of material under test. Conventional planar interdigital sensors and novel planar interdigital sensors have been designed, fabricated and tested for detection of dangerous marine biotoxins in seafood. Our main objective is to sense the presence of dangerous contaminated acid in mussels and other seafoods. Initial studies were conducted with three peptide derivatives namely Sarcosine, Proline and Hydroxylproline. These three chemicals are structurally closely related to our target molecule (domoic acid). The initial results have shown that all sensors respond very well to the chemicals and it is possible to discriminate the different chemicals from the output of the sensor. Novel interdigital sensors have shown better sensitivity measurement compared to conventional interdigital sensors. The novel interdigital sensors were then being tested with three seafood products. Results from the analysis have shown that novel interdigital sensor with configuration #1 (Sensor_1) has better sensitivity compared to other sensors. Sensor_1 has been chosen for experiment using proline and mussels. The changes in sensor sensitivity were analysed with mussels before and after adding the proline. The presence of proline on the mussel surface and also injected proline to the mussel samples were clearly detected by Sensor_1. Further experiment was conducted with small amount of domoic acid (0.5 &#181;g to 5.0 &#181;g) injected to a mussel and it was found that Sensor_1 was able to detect small amount of domoic acid (1.0 &#181;g) injected into the mussel sample. Sensor_1 was able to detect approximately 12.6 &#181;g/g of domoic acid in mussel meat. Three threshold levels of particular sample thickness have been established for detection of domoic acid. The first prototype of a low cost sensing system known as SIT (Seafood Inspection Tool) has been developed. The outcomes from the experiments provide chances of opportunity for further research in developing a low cost miniature type of sensors for reliable sensing system for commercial use.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planar electromagnetic sensors</field><field name="subject">interdigital sensors</field><field name="subject">seafood toxins</field><field name="subject">peptide derivatives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299903 Biosensor technolgies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluency enhancement : applications to machine translation : thesis for Master of Engineering in Information &amp; Telecommunications Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Manion, Steve Lawrence</field><field name="description">The quality of Machine Translation (MT) can often be poor due to it appearing incoherent and lacking in fluency.

With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eating as a cultural performance in early 21st century New Zealand : an exploration of the relationships between food and place : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Markwick, Moira</field><field name="description">During New Zealand&#8217;s comparatively short history as a nation, its cuisine has undergone great development. The culinary traditions brought by the early settlers, from both Eastern Polynesia and then Britain, offered a relatively limited variety, however, since the late 20th century New Zealand&#8217;s foodways have undergone a revolution; today a smorgasbord of international cuisines awaits our selection. This gastronomic range is the result of a number of factors which include the influx of diverse immigrants, increased air travel by New Zealanders, the return of military personnel from overseas and globalisation. To conduct this investigation of the relationships between people, identity, food and place I approach the topic from three perspectives. Firstly, I examine how exotic foods are used to link immigrants to New Zealand with loved ones in their homelands, and also how the same foods act as a bridge between those immigrants and other New Zealanders. Secondly, I look at how exotic foods serve to connect New Zealanders with, generally, far-away places, as through its evocative powers food has the ability to transport ordinary people to places where they may rather be. Lastly, I explore how some New Zealanders are making exotic foods &#8216;ours&#8217; by combining them with the abundance of fresh local produce. Appropriating the exotic and combining it with the indigenous to make it ours is the story of New Zealand; our society has developed through the arrival of many people and cultures, and food is a lens through which to observe this process today. This work differs from many ethnographic accounts in that it does not focus on a coherent group of people, but rather is based around the theme of food and eating in the New Zealand context. The thesis is the culmination of approximately twelve months of data gathering for which a multi-method approach was used. This process included: a review of both academic and popular literature; visits to food-related places such as cultural festivals, wine and food festivals, Agricultural and Pastoral Shows, Home Shows, community markets, farmers&#8217; markets, various Auckland supermarkets, ethnic food stores, specialty food shops; mainstream and ethnic caf&#233;s and restaurants, shopping centre food courts and various other miscellaneous places; attending different ethnic cooking courses and a series of semi-structured interviews. The interview process used different interviewee configurations: individuals, married couples and pairs, in an attempt to generate various perspectives and so enhance the data. The thesis concludes that, firstly, exotic foods represent a means by which immigrants are able to connect with both loved ones remaining in the old home, and also to form new relationships with other New Zealanders in their new home. Secondly, exotic foods, through either their consumption or through people&#8217;s memories of consumption, provide a bridge between New Zealanders and other places. Lastly, New Zealanders are increasingly taking exotic foods, combining them with the nation&#8217;s abundant local and unique indigenous foodstuffs and making it ours</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eating sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">food sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">cultural performance</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary adaptations : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Elsa Sian</field><field name="description">It is the contention of this thesis that the field of adaptation studies is struggling to emerge from a restrictive, outdated and static paradigmatic framework. It proposes that the field would benefit from widening its current frame of reference to include more input and perspectives from the evolutionary biological sciences. This thesis considers the implications for the study of culture of the Darwinian theory of evolution &#8211; how it might become a more integral part of how we understand culture generally, and of how we read specific texts. It attempts to re-contextualise adaptation studies within an ongoing, conceptual paradigm shift in Western culture, initiated by Darwin&#8217;s publication of his theory of evolution by natural selection. It contends that the Darwinian Revolution is far from complete within the humanities and that the time is ripe for greater consilience and exchange between the bio-sciences and humanities disciplines. This thesis explores the current state of adaptation studies as a discipline, referring in particular to recent work by adaptation theorists such as Robert Stam, Linda Hutcheon, Thomas Leitch and Julie Sanders and their efforts to reinvigorate and redirect adaptation studies. It considers how deeply ingrained, evaluative modes of thought could be holding back these efforts, and if an updated, mutable Darwinian paradigm could aid them. This thesis also speculates on the viability of an evolutionary unit of culture, the meme, and its possible relevance to adaptation studies and the wider study of culture. Finally, it applies a Darwinian perspective, on various levels, to an extensive, detailed textual analysis of the non-fiction book The Orchid Thief and the film Adaptation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary adaptation studies</field><field name="subject">Darwinian theory of evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420302 Cultural theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating the contribution of different sources to the burden of human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mullner, Petra</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the molecular epidemiology of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella in New Zealand and the development of source attribution tools for these pathogens. Although campylobacteriosis is the leading enteric zoonosis worldwide, the pathogen's complex epidemiology and di culties with existing typing schemes, have posed challenges for the control of this disease. The  rst study of this thesis gives an overview of existing approaches to microbial risk assessment and source attribution, with particular respect to campylobacteriosis, and describes their advantages and shortcomings. Further, the chapter discusses phenoand genotyping techniques for Campylobacter spp. and the value of including microbial typing data in risk assessments. In the second study, data from a sentinel surveillance site in the Manawatu region was used to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human campylobacteriosis cases. This analysis revealed the presence of a dominant C. jejuni clone, namely sequence type (ST) 474, which accounted for 30.7 % of human cases in the study and identi ed risk factors for infection with ruminant and poultry associated STs. The third study investigated the link between C. jejuni in human cases and samples taken from poultry. By applying epidemiological and population genetic techniques this part of the thesis provided further evidence that poultry is a major contributor to human infection. In the fourth study an existing Bayesian source attribution model was modi ed and consecutively applied to New Zealand's major foodborne zoonoses: campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis. The majority (80 %) of human campylobacteriosis cases attributable to C. jejuni were estimated to have been acquired from poultry sources, whereas wildlife source were estimated to contribute only a minor proportion of cases. In the  fth study the Salmonella dataset was descriptively analysed and a large proportion of human cases was found to be caused by `exotic' Salmonella types. In the  nal study of this thesis four di erent genetic and epidemiological source attribution methodologies were applied to the same dataset in a comparative modelling framework. iv The studies in this thesis show that epidemiological studies combined with molecular tools and modeling can provide valuable risk-based tools to inform the surveillance and control of zoonotic pathogens. Methods from these studies may be readily applied to the control of other (food borne) zoonoses and provide new opportunities for epidemiological investigations and source attribution modelling of major pathogens.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">Salmonella</field><field name="subject">molecular epidemiology</field><field name="subject">human campylobaceriosis</field><field name="subject">human salmonellosis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of in vitro assays for detection of anthelmintic resistance in cattle nematodes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (Animal Science) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mshanga, Deogratius Andrew</field><field name="description">The principle aim of the current research was to modify the larval development assay (LDA) for use with Cooperia from cattle. A series of experiments were conducted in order to modify the LDA protocol to determine the most appropriate culture media and incubation temperature. These initial experiments concluded that, of the protocols examined, a culture medium of 1/8th the concentration of E. coli (EC) + 1/4th the concentration of yeast extract (YE) as generally used to culture sheep nematodes, at a culture temperature of 18&#186;C, resulted in the optimum number of Cooperia larvae developed to the third larval stage (L3). However, the number of eggs that developed to L3 was still generally low. A comparison was then made using isolates from a farm with a history of resistance in Cooperia to ivermectin (IV) and benzimidazoles (BZ) and two farms with a history of no resistance in this parasite. These experiments were undertaken using 1/8EC + 1/4YE media protocol and 1/2EC + 1/2YE concentration of the standard culture media for sheep nematodes. These three isolates were cultured at temperature of 18&#186;C and 25 &#186;C in the commercially available DrenchRite&#174; 96-well microtitre assay plates which contained BZ, levamisole (LV) and IV in doubling dilutions within an agar matrix. The LD50 values were determined from a dose response curve. The resulting LD50 values were very variable, especially for the IV analogues. There was no obvious difference between the resistant and susceptible farms for the LD50 values of BZ or IV. A secondary aim of this research was to investigate the potential usefulness of the larval feeding inhibition assay (LFIA). This was adopted as published and it was determined it could be used to distinguish between susceptible and resistant Teladorsagia circumcincta with a resistance ratio of at least six. This research concluded that further research is required to fully optimise the LDA for Cooperia in cattle but adequate dose response curves were determined to indicate it struggles to distinguish BZ and IV resistance. The LFIA deserves to be further investigated as it offers some scope to detect ivermectin resistance in cattle nematodes as the dose response curves demonstrated a good repeatability for T. circumcincta from sheep. Comparing LDA and LFIA, both assays seemed to be useful but the latter was considered to have greater potential.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cattle nematodes</field><field name="subject">larval development assay</field><field name="subject">Cooperia larvae</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of consuming farmed salmon compared to salmon oil capsules on long chain omega 3 fatty acid and selenium status in humans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Human Nutrition, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pauga, Melanie</field><field name="description">Salmon is a good source of long chain (LC) omega 3 fatty acids and selenium; these are well recognised for their health benefits. Recommendations for LC omega 3 fatty acid intakes presume equivalence between fish and fish oil. The aim of this research was to compare the effects of consuming salmon with salmon oil capsules on LC omega 3 fatty acid and selenium status. Forty four healthy subjects were randomly assigned to consume either two servings of 120 g farmed New Zealand King (FNZK) salmon/week or 2, 4 or 6 capsules of salmon oil/day for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measures, food consumption habits information and blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained at the study commencement and ending. Each subject&#8217;s intake of LC omega 3 fatty acids and selenium was determined by analysing the fatty acid and selenium content of duplicate portions of cooked salmon and capsules. The amount of salmon consumed was then calculated by subtracting unconsumed amounts of salmon and then calculating the intake of LC omega 3 fatty acids as grams of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed per day. Percentage of compliance to capsule intake, based on counts of unconsumed capsules, was calculated to determine the amount of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed per day from capsules. Change in red blood cells (RBC) LC omega 3 fatty acid levels from equivalent amounts of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed from capsules and salmon were compared using linear regression analysis predictive models fitted to the capsule data. Omega 3 index was calculated. LC omega 3 fatty acid intakes from salmon and 2, 4 and 6 capsules were 0.82, 0.24, 0.47 and 0.68 g/day, respectively. Equal amounts of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed from salmon and capsules resulted in similar increases in RBC LC omega 3 fatty acids and omega 3 index (RBC eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): 0.80 [0.58 &#8211; 1.02] vs. 1.00 [0.71 &#8211; 1.27] %; RBC docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): 0.93 [0.58 &#8211; 1.29] vs. 0.99 [0.68 &#8211; 1.31] %; omega 3 index: 1.92 [1.46 &#8211; 2.38] vs. 2.25 [1.65 &#8211; 2.83] %).

In the first part, the expression and accumulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase (ACO), the enzyme which catalyses the final step of ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants, is examined during exposure of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to a water deficit. The second part of this thesis is focused on the identification and characterisation of a water-deficit-associated ACC synthase (ACS), the enzyme which catalyses the production of ACC. In the first part, two white clover varieties with differing sensitivity to water deficit, a drought-tolerant Tienshan ecotype and a drought-sensitive Grasslands Challenge cv. Kopu II cultivar were exposed to two water deficit treatments: one cycle of water deficit (designated non-prestressed; NPS) and a water deficit, a rehydration period and then a second water deficit treatment (designated pre-stressed; PS) in the New Zealand Climate Environment Laboratory (NZCEL). Treatments were terminated when the petiole elongation rate (PER) in the first fully-expanded leaf reached zero. Water relations, growth responses, the expression of the white clover ACO genes, TR-ACO1 TR-ACO2 and TR-ACO3 and the accumulation of two of the corresponding proteins, TR-ACO1 and TR-ACO2, were then examined. The soil water content (SWC) and leaf water potential (LWP) measured in both varieties and in both water deficit treatments declined progressively. The rate of decline in SWC and LWP was slower in the Tienshan ecotype with no difference between the NPS and PS treatments. However, the LWP in the Tienshan ecotype at the point at which the PER ceased was less negative (ca. -1.4 MPa) compared to Kopu (ca. -1.7 MPa). In addition, the decline in the PER differed between NPS- and PS-treated Kopu. In the NPS-treated Kopu, the PER was maintained at a high rate when plants were exposed to SWC above 18%, but declined sharply as the SWC declined further. However, in the PS-treated Kopu, the PER declined more progressively in a similar pattern to that determined for NPS- and PS-treated Tienshan. Expression of TR-ACO1 and accumulation of TR-ACO1 was observed in the apical structure of the stolon. As the water deficit progressed, no significant alteration in TR-ACO1 expression and TR-ACO1 protein accumulation was observed in the apical structures of both the NPS- and PS-treated Tienshan ecotype suggesting some degree of protection of the meristem tissues in this more drought-tolerant variety. However, a discernable decline in expression of TR-ACO1 and accumulation of TR-ACO1 protein was observed in the NPS-treated Kopu suggesting some degree of tissue injury in this more drought-susceptible variety. However, after the pre-stress (PS) treatment, no real changes in TR-ACO1 expression and TR-ACO1 protein accumulation were observed, in common with the observations for the NPS- and PS-treated Tienshan ecotype suggesting that meristem protection may now be occurring. The results suggest further that the pre-stress treatment of the more drought-susceptible Kopu may result in a degree of acclimation to the water deficit. For the first-fully expanded leaves, expression of two transcripts, TR-ACO2 and TR-ACO3 and accumulation of TR-ACO2 protein was monitored as the SWC decreased. The expression of TR-ACO2 and accumulation of TR-ACO2 decreased as the water deficit progressed in both the NPS- and PS-treated Tienshan ecotype and correlated with the decrease in PER. By contrast, in the NPS-treated Kopu, TR-ACO2 expression and TR-ACO2 protein accumulation increased, but again, after a period of pre-stress, TR-ACO2 expression and TR-ACO2 accumulation decreased, in common with the Tienshan ecotype. Again, the pre-stress treatment of the drought-susceptible Kopu may result in a degree of acclimation to the water deficit such that the responses become similar to those observed in the more drought-tolerant Tienshan ecotype. However, in both NPS- and PS-treated Tienshan and Kopu there was no significant alteration in the expression of TR-ACO3 in the first fully-expanded leaf. The expression of TR-ACO2 and TR-ACO3 and accumulation of TR-ACO2 protein were also observed in the second fully-expanded leaves (an older tissue). Again similar patterns in the expression of TR-ACO2 and TR-ACO3 and accumulation of TR-ACO2 protein were observed in both NPS- and PS-treated Tienshan and Kopu. In these leaves, expression of TR-ACO2 and accumulation of TR-ACO2 protein decreased as the water deficit progressed, but expression of TR-ACO3 increased as the water deficit decreased to less than 10%. These results suggest that responses of younger tissues (apical structure; first-fully expanded leaf) maybe the critical determinant for the tolerant (or otherwise) of white clover plants to water deficit. In the second part of this thesis, four ACS genes were identified from the Tienshan ecotype exposed to water deficit and designated TR-ACS-T. Three of these were similar to previously identified TR-ACS genes from Grasslands Challenge genotype 10F while the fourth was a novel gene designated TR-ACS4-T. TR-ACS4-T is 64%, 64% and 63% homologous to TR-ACS1-T, TR-ACS2-T and TR-ACS3-T, respectively in terms of nucleotide sequence. In the GeneBank database, TR-ACS4-T shares highly homology to ACC synthase sequences from a wide range of tissues including seedlings and fruit tissues, in addition to a high homology to ACS genes induced in auxin-, wounding- and ethylene-treated tissues. The pattern of TR-ACS4-T expression observed during leaf development suggests that the gene is expressed initially in the apical structures and in the newly initiated leaves, and then again in the later mature leaves and those at the onset of senescence. Expression decreases again during senescence. TR-ACS4-T expression is not altered by water deficit, but is induced by both ethylene and NAA treatment, but the auxin-induced TR-ACS4-T is mediated by ethylene treatment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethylene biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens L.</field><field name="subject">white clover</field><field name="subject">water deficit</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and characterisation of biocompatible semiconductor nanocrystals</field><field name="creator">Lees, Emma E.</field><field name="description">Semiconductor nanocrystals exhibit unique optical and physical properties that make them an attractive alternative to organic dyes for fluorescent bioapplications.

U. S.</field><field name="description">Experiments were conducted to assess whether a concept termed 'attract and reward' (A&amp;R) could enhance conservation biological control (CBC). In A&amp;R, a synthetically-produced herbivore induced plant volatile (HIPV) ('attract') is combined with a floral resource ('reward'). It is anticipated that the two will work synergistically attracting natural enemies into the crop ('attract') and maintaining them within the crop ('reward'). The study system consists of brassica, the most commonly occurring brassica herbivores, their natural enemies and higher order natural enemies. The HIPV deployed is methyl salicylate (MeSA) and the floral resource is buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum. The aim of the first two field experiments, in 2007 and 2008, was to evaluate the effects of MeSA and MeSA combined with buckwheat (A&amp;R) on the abundance of arthropods from three trophic levels. In 2007, a field experiment was conducted using MeSA alone. The mean abundance of the leafmining fly Scaptomyza flava (trophic level 2), the diamondback moth (trophic level 2)(DBM) parasitoid Diadegma semiclausum (trophic level 2) and the hoverfly Melangyna novaezealandiae (trophic level 3) was increased in MeSA-treatments by up to 300% and for the brown lacewing parasitoid Anacharis zealandica a maximum mean increase of 600% was recorded. Significantly more females of the D. semiclausum and M. novaezealandiae were attracted to MeSA than males. When A&amp;R was deployed in 2008, were arthropods from the third and fourth trophic levels affected. For none of the species was there a synergistic effect between 'attract' and 'reward' on their abundance. The brown lacewing Micromus tasmaniae (trophic level 3), two parasitoids of DBM and one of cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae (trophic level 2) increased significantly in treatments with buckwheat. The hoverfly Melanostoma fasciatum (trophic level 3) was significantly more abundant in treatments with MeSA, but significantly less abundant in treatments with buckwheat. The effect of MeSA on the fourth trophic level parasitoid Anacharis zealandica (trophic level 4) was inconsistent between years. Here it significantly decreased its abundance, while treatments with buckwheat increased it.  Significantly fewer male than female D. semiclausum were attracted to MeSA only treatments. These experiments show that MeSA and buckwheat can have unwanted effects on arthropod abundance which may disrupt CBC. To assess the effect of A&amp;R on CBC a further field experiment evaluating herbivore densities, predation, parasitism and hyper-parasitism rates was conducted. The only effect was significantly higher aphid parasitism in treatments with MeSA. Based on the results from the field experiments it remained unclear whether it was MeSA or a blend of volatiles produced by MeSA-induced host plants that were attractive to the arthropods. An olfactory experiment was conducted to evaluate if the aphid parasitoid Aphidius colemani can be attracted to two different concentrations of MeSA diluted in Synertrol oil. Significantly more parasitoids were attracted to 2.0% MeSA than to air while the parasitoid did not respond to the 0.5% concentration. These results indicate that A&amp;R has potential as a CBC technique, as long as any unwanted side effects can be managed. Although there were no synergistic effects between 'attract' and 'reward' on the abundance of individual natural enemies, combining MeSA and buckwheat could still be beneficial because the two techniques increase the abundance of different natural enemies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attract and reward</field><field name="subject">herbivore-induced plant volatile</field><field name="subject">methyl salicylate</field><field name="subject">buckwheat</field><field name="subject">brassica</field><field name="subject">trophic level</field><field name="subject">habitat manipulation</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable restoration of mine sites</field><field name="creator">Krisnayanti, Dewi</field><field name="description">A sustainable approach to restoration of the post-mining landscape involves creating conditions where a viable growth medium can be established with the minimal amount of fertiliser inputs over a period of time.  Ideally, this growth medium should comprise a combination of minerals, organic matter, and biological components with have the capacity to retain and release nutrients over time. When combined with a re-vegetation scheme appropriate to the biogeographic area, a self-sustaining ecosystem can be established. Regulatory requirements for mine restoration typically require the use of topsoil, which is often in limited supply. However, overburden is commonly present in vast quantities and has the potential to be used as a restoration substrate with appropriate amendments. There are significant gaps in our understanding of factors relating to the use and amendment of overburden as a growing medium.  The main objective of this study was to investigate and quantify the effects of inorganic and organic amendments and weathering on nutrient availability and plant growth in topsoil and overburden material obtained from the OceanaGold Globe Progress mine at Reefton, New Zealand. A series of glasshouse experiments were carried out on topsoil, fresh overburden and mullock (old waste rock) amended with biosolids, green manure, sawdust, lime and mineral fertiliser nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)).  R esults demonstrated that 300 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; was sufficient to overcome N deficiency in topsoil, while 100 kg P ha&#8315;&#185; was required to overcome P deficiency. Addition of biosolids to topsoil and overburden increased plant biomass production, without increasing heavy metal concentrations. Amendment of overburden significantly affected weathering rates by accelerating the formation of secondary minerals. In particular, lupin green manure accelerated the formation of organic iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) organic complexes, resulting from the decomposition of the green manure and release of Fe from primary minerals. Results revealed that wineberry and red beech required 200 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; for optimum growth. Overall, the findings of this research identified key parameters for effective utilisation of overburden as a restoration substrate. A sustainable restoration method for managing the topsoil and/or any overburden or waste rock material remaining at mine sites can be achieved by careful selection of organic amendments and allowing an initial weathering period.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal availability</field><field name="subject">nutrient availability</field><field name="subject">weathering</field><field name="subject">red beech (Nothofagus fusca)</field><field name="subject">wineberry (Aristotelia serrata)</field><field name="subject">lupin (Lupinus angustifolius)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A modelling of microstructure evolution and crack opening in FCC materials under tension</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Nam Nhat</field><field name="description">The field of fracture mechanics can generally be divided into two groups: (i) the study of material behaviour prior to crack and (ii) the developing of crack opening criteria. Even though various studies have been done in both subjects there are still gaps that need to be bridged. This thesis aims at combining both groups of the modelling of dynamic fracture in crystalline materials at a reasonable cost of computational time. A model of crystal plasticity finite element method has been formulated to account for the effects of lattice structure in the crystalline materials. The model has been applied to simulate tensile deformation around a notch tip in both single crystals and polycrystalline aggregates. By comparing with observations from various experiments, the model has been proved to be able to accurately capture the material&#8217;s behaviours around a notch tip undergoing tensile load. Particularly, this model is among the very few, if not the first, that accurately predicts various experimental observations of two notch tip orientations (010)[101] and (010)[100] that are widely found in the literature. This study has also developed a crack opening criterion that is dependent upon the evolution of the lattice structure. The core of this new criterion is an atomic interaction model that estimates energies of the interface of an fcc bicrystal. Results of grain boundary energy of &lt;100&gt; and &lt;110&gt; symmetrical tilt boundaries of an aluminum bicrystal obtained from the atomic interaction model agree very well with those from molecular dynamics simulations. The newly developed criterion has been applied to the modelling of crack opening and crack growth in a region around the notch tip in single crystals. Elements in the finite element mesh satisfying the criterion are removed from the mesh by using the element removal technique in Abaqus/Standard. Missing elements effectively act as voids in the material. Thus crack opening (in terms of void nucleation) and the subsequent crack growth (in terms of coalescence of new and existing voids) are captured naturally. The newly developed methodology to model crack opening has been applied to predict mode I crack growth around a notch tip in Cube and Brass oriented fcc single crystals. The obtained results show similar behaviours of crack growth with those from molecular dynamics simulations of single crystals having the same lattice orientations. The thodology to model crack opening that has been proposed in this thesis is original. It enables the explicit modelling of crack growth without presuming a crack path. Also, a predefined crack opening criterion, which could be erroneous, that has been used in many finite element simulations of fracture is avoided. To the best of the author&#8217;s knowledge, the criterion of crack opening that depends on the structure of the interface of two misoriented lattices is presented in this study for the first time. The current thesis focuses into modelling tensile deformation and the subsequent fracture in fcc crystals. The methodology that has been proposed however can be readily applied to crystalline materials of various lattice structures with minor modifications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security enhanced agent systems</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Qi</field><field name="description">Software agents are useful for distributed systems and electronic commerce. However, to fully deploy software agents in practice, a number of challenging issues, especially security and privacy, need to be addressed. In general, software agents can be classified into mobile agent and multi-agent, which have different security requirements.Mobile agents are mobile in the sense that they can move in the defined computer network. Due to this nature, security and privacy become critical. When a mobile agent travels in a hostile environment or migrates to an untrusted platform, its security and privacy can be easily compromised. In particular, the remote hosts in which agents visit and get services are not considered to be trusted. Existing solutions suggest that remote hosts together with the agent&#8217;s home jointly sign the service agreement. Therefore, proxy-based signing model was utilized. We observe that this actually poses a serious problem: a host which should be excluded from the desirable hosts could also generate a signed service agreement. In order to solve this problem, we propose a secure mobile agent transaction scheme which achieves host authentication with designated hosts. In our scheme, only selected hosts can be included in the agent network and hence generate a valid signed service agreement.  We also propose a variant of our scheme that provides a shorter signature size.Multi-agent systems are different from mobile agents systems in that they are not mobile. Although multi-agent systems do not have the security risks stemming from mobility, they have other security problems. Unfortunately, security and privacy issues have not been adequately addressed. Most proposed schemes only concern with security protection rather than privacy protection. Privacy issues have not drawn adequate attention and actually been ignored or mistreated in most proposed multi-agent protocols. We argue that privacy issues are indeed not trivial and cannot be resolved with traditional security mechanisms. If agents do not trust each other, their privacy must be protected. In order to solve the issue, we propose a novel secure multi-agent protocol which captures several most important security properties including data confidentiality, agent privacy and authenticity.In our scheme, privacy protection is applied to both negotiating parties (agents). The security protection in our scheme satisfies the most stringent security level, i.e., indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc oxide TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) and polycrystalline silicon thin-films for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Song, Dengyuan, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films are very promising for application in photovoltaics. It is extremely challenging to develop cheap TCOs and poly-Si films to make photovoltaic devices. The aim of this thesis is to study sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO TCO and poly-Si films by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) for application in low-cost photovoltaics. The investigated aspects have been (i) to develop and characterize sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films that can be used as a TCO material on crystalline silicon solar cells, (ii) to explore the potential of the developed ZnO:Al films for application in ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, (iii) to make and characterize poly-Si thin-films on different kinds of glass substrates by SPC using electron-beam evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) [referred to as EVA poly-Si material (SPC of evaporated a-Si)], and (iv) to fabricate EVA poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass and improve the energy conversion efficiency of these cells by post-crystallization treatments. The ZnO:Al work in this thesis is focused on the correlation between film characteristics and deposition parameters, such as rf sputter power (Prf), working gas pressure (Pw), and substrate temperature (Tsub), to get a clear picture of film properties in the optimized conditions for application in photovoltaic devices. Especially the laterally non-uniform film properties resulting from the laterally inhomogeneous erosion of the target material are investigated in detail. The influence of Prf, Pw and Tsub on the structural, electrical, optical and surface morphology properties of ZnO:Al films is discussed. It is found that the lateral variations of the parameters of ZnO:Al films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering can be reduced to acceptable levels by optimising the deposition parameters.  ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabricated ZnO:Al films for application in heterojunction solar cells. In this application, expensive indium-tin oxide (ITO) is usually used. Under the standard AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2, 25 ??C), the best fabricated cell shows an open-circuit voltage of 411 mV, a short-circuit current density of 30.0 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 66.7 %, and a conversion efficiency of 8.2 %. This is believed to be the highest stable efficiency ever reported for this type of cell. By means of dark forward current density-voltage-temperature (J-V-T) measurements, it is shown that the dominant current transport mechanism in the ZnO:Al/c-Si solar cells, in the intermediate forward bias voltage region, is trap-assisted multistep tunneling. EVA poly-Si thin-films are prepared on four types of glass substrates (planar and textured glass, both either bare or SiN-coated) based on evaporated Si, which is a cheaper Si deposition method than the existing technologies. The textured glass is realized by the UNSW-developed AIT process (AIT = aluminium-induced texture). The investigation is concentrated on finding optimized process parameters and evaluating film crystallization quality. It is found that EVA poly-Si films have a grain size in the range 0.8-1.5 ??m, and a preferential (111) orientation. UV reflectance and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a high crystalline material quality, both at the air-side surface and in the bulk. EVA cells are fabricated in both substrate and superstrate configuration. Special attention is paid to improving the Voc of the solar cells. For this purpose, after the SPC process, the samples receive the two post-crystallization treatments: (i) a rapid thermal anneal (RTA), and (ii) a plasma hydrogenation. It is found that two post-crystallization treatments more than double the 1-Sun Voc of the substrate-type cells. It is demonstrated that RTA improves the structural material quality of the cells. Furthermore, a hydrogenation step is shown to significantly improve the electronic material quality of the cells. Based on the RTA???d and hydrogenated EVA poly-Si material, the first mesa-type EVA cells are fabricated in substrate configuration, by using sputtered Al-doped ZnO as the transparent front contact. The investigation is focused on addressing the correlation between the type of the substrate and cell performance. Optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the devices are characterized. It is found that the performance  of EVA cells depends on the glass substrate topography. For cells on textured glass, the AIT texture is shown to have a beneficial effect on the optical absorption of EVA films. It is demonstrated that a SiN barrier layer on the AIT-textured glass improves significantly both the crystalline quality of the poly-Si films and the energy conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells. For cells on planar glass, a SiN film between the planar glass and the poly-Si film has no obvious effect on the cell properties. The investigations in this thesis clearly show that EVA poly-Si films are very promising for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">thin films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deconstructing the racialisation experience of Asian Australians: process, impact and response</field><field name="creator">Hollero, Maria Elisa, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study uses racialisation as a lens to understand the racist experiences of ordinary Asian Australians. It examines the racialisation processes underlying these experiences and explores the strategies employed to respond to and mitigate the impact of being racialised. It addresses the need to develop the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of racialisation and anti-racism in light of the dearth of research work on these especially in Australia.  Different elements from various theories were drawn to frame the empirical investigation since no single theory was adequate as anchor for this qualitative study. In-depth interviews and focus groups with 64 Asian Australians generated rich narratives that provided interesting insights on the personal, political, and spiritual dimensions of human experience that connect the lives of racialised subjects.  Deconstructing stories of racialised subjects laid bare the essence of racist experiences by revealing insights into when and how race becomes a salient signifier of difference. Racialisation provides a productive way of understanding racist experiences since it allows for the unpacking of the multi-layered linked processes of racial categorisation, racial differentiation and problematisation, marginalisation and exclusion, inferiorisation and devaluation. These processes are ordinarily part of the experiences of minority people. They constitute what can be called 'everyday racialisation'.  The study uses stress-coping theory to examine the long-term and cumulative impact of being part of a racialised group. It shows how exposure to racism stressors has multifarious effects on the health and well-being of racialised subjects. The everyday racialisation of minority groups affects their socio-psychological functioning and limits the life chances and economic opportunities available to them.  In addition, the study demonstrates how Asian Australians cope with the stress of their everyday racialisation by drawing from their personal repertoire of discursive, cognitive and behavioural strategies. These, in combination with outside support mechanisms, make up what can be termed ?everyday anti-racism? strategies. Racialisation provides valuable insights into when, how and why racialised subjects deploy these different strategies to negotiate, contest and bridge the constraints and boundaries imposed on them.  The study offers an integrated model for understanding racialisation experience and lays the foundation for developing further the concepts of  'everyday racialisation' and 'everyday antiracism'.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Ethnic identity -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Asians -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Australia -- Social conditions -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Race relations -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons</field><field name="creator">Fedorow, Heidi, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark polymer pigment present in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Interest in this pigment has rekindled in recent years because of a hypothesised link between NM and the especial vulnerability of NM-containing neurons to cell death in Parkinson???s disease (PD). Many aspects of the biology of NM are yet to be characterised. It is not known if NM like the similar melanin of the skin is synthesised via an enzymatic pathway or solely through autoxidation as has traditionally been thought. Examination of the ultrastructure of NM granules showed that in contrast to peripheral melanosomes, an electron-lucent lipid component was present that represented 30% of pigment volume. The identity of the lipid component of NM has remained unclear since it was first suggested that NM contained lipid in the 1960???s. NM lipid was biochemically isolated from the substantia nigra of 32 human brains. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry and 1H- and 13C NMR techniques, it was shown for the first time that the NM lipid is the polyisoprenoid dolichol. The age-related development and regulation of NM has not previously been described. Optical density and area measurements of unstained NM in ventral substantia nigra neurons spanning the ages of 24 weeks to 95 years old demonstrated three developmental phases. NM was not present at birth and initiation of pigmentation began at approximately 3 years of age, followed by a period of increasing pigment granule number and colouration until age 20. In PD brain, the ultrastructure of NM demonstrated that the amount of lipid did not change. However, filipin staining showed a reduction of cholesterol in PD NM containing neurons. In addition, immunogold staining of ??-synuclein demonstrated that this protein redistributed to the NM lipid in PD brain. The finding of phases in the development of NM, and the identification of lipid species in NM suggest that NM biology is regulated. This thesis has also demonstrated changes in the lipid and associated proteins in PD, suggesting NM???s chemical composition alters which may have functional consequences that contribute to PD.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rattus tanezumi in the upland rice terraces of Banaue, Philippines: demography, habitat use, crop damage and yield assessment.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Rachel Weslie, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rodents cause significant damage to agricultural crops throughout the world, including rice, the staple food for the increasing population of Southeast Asia. Little is known about the ecology of pest rodent species, resulting in much effort being concentrated on ineffective, time consuming control practices. This research was designed to understand the demography and habitat use of the major pest rodent (Rattus tanezumi) of the Banaue rice terraces in order to identify the most efficient time and location to undertake pest control. Rodent crop damage and associated yield loss was also assessed in order to provide information for a cost : benefit analysis of rodent control practices. And the beliefs, perceptions and practices of Banaue rice farmers were investigated to assist in identifying future compatible rodent control programs. Replicated cage trapping was undertaken for a twelve month period over the entire rice cropping season in two study sites in the Municipality of Banaue Philippines. The breeding season of R. tanezumi corresponded with periods of food availability from the transplanted to ripening stages of the rice crop. A non-breeding season occurred from the fallow to seedling stages. The distinct breeding season occurred within the rice fields and adjacent village and scrub habitats. Radio-tracked and spool-and-line tracked R. tanezumi moved from adjacent habitats into the rice field during the breeding season, and individuals persisted in all habitat types, including the rice field, during the fallow, nonbreeding season. Overall rice yield was significantly greater (43%) in areas where rodents were excluded by fencing compared to areas where rodents were not excluded. More rodent damage to rice tillers occurred at the booting than at the ripening stage of the rice crop. These results suggest that to prevent rodent damage, control should be undertaken at the end of the R. tanezumi non-breeding season (prior to transplanting), before rodent numbers multiply and crop damage occurs. Further, the cost-benefit analysis of non-chemical rodent control programs in Banaue, suggests that benefits accrue once yield loss is likely to exceed 5%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philippines.</field><field name="subject">Rattue tanezumi.</field><field name="subject">Rodent damage.</field><field name="subject">Rodents -- Control.</field><field name="subject">Agricultural pests.</field><field name="subject">Demography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Document management and retrieval for specialised domains: an evolutionary user-based approach</field><field name="creator">Kim, Mihye, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Browsing marked-up documents by traversing hyperlinks has become probably the most important means by which documents are accessed, both via the World Wide Web (WWW) and organisational Intranets. However, there is a pressing demand for document management and retrieval systems to deal appropriately with the massive number of documents available. There are two classes of solution: general search engines, whether for the WWW or an Intranet, which make little use of specific domain knowledge or hand-crafted specialised systems which are costly to build and maintain. The aim of this thesis was to develop a document management and retrieval system suitable for small communities as well as individuals in specialised domains on the Web. The aim was to allow users to easily create and maintain their own organisation of documents while ensuring continual improvement in the retrieval performance of the system as it evolves. The system developed is based on the free annotation of documents by users and is browsed using the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). A number of annotation support tools were developed to aid the annotation process so that a suitable system evolved. Experiments were conducted in using the system to assist in finding staff and student home pages at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales. Results indicated that the annotation tools provided a good level of assistance so that documents were easily organised and a lattice-based browsing structure that evolves in an ad hoc fashion provided good efficiency in retrieval performance. An interesting result suggested that although an established external taxonomy can be useful in proposing annotation terms, users appear to be very selective in their use of terms proposed. Results also supported the hypothesis that the concept lattice of FCA helped take users beyond a narrow search to find other useful documents. In general, lattice-based browsing was considered as a more helpful method than Boolean queries or hierarchical browsing for searching a specialised domain. We conclude that the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis, supported by annotation techniques is a useful way of supporting the flexible open management of documents required by individuals, small communities and in specialised domains. It seems likely that this approach can be readily integrated with other developments such as further improvements in search engines and the use of semantically marked-up documents, and provide a unique advantage in supporting autonomous management of documents by individuals and groups - in a way that is closely aligned with the autonomy of the WWW.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Database management</field><field name="subject">Lattice theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the demagnetisation process and possible alternative magnetic treatments for naval vessels</field><field name="creator">Baynes, Timothy Malcolm, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naval submarines and surface ships are regularly subjected to a treatment called &amp;quotdeperming&amp;quot that seeks to design the vessel???s permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate various aspects of the deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A &amp;quotlaboratory MTF&amp;quot was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU200T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ??5%) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU200T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ??0.1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0.94 ??0.09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA2S-E and CU200T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU200T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5.97??10-3 and 0.0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D): redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel &amp;quotanhysteretic deperm&amp;quot method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin???s equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. &amp;quotSympathetic deperming&amp;quot occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (&amp;gt 0.1m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0.5mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Degaussing</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic devices</field><field name="subject">Magnetism of ships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of incentives, uncertainty and transaction costs on the efficiency of public sector outsourcing contracts</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Paul H., Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the late 1970s, the world has experienced a wave of microeconomic reform that has resulted in the privatisation of many previously State-owned assets, as well as other reforms directed at improving the efficiency of government business enterprises.

Despite the prevalence of outsourcing, there has been relatively little empirical work analysing the effects of outsourcing at the contract level. This dissertation addresses three important empirical issues related to outsourcing. First, analysis of the magnitude and sources of cost savings associated with outsourcing was undertaken using a present value costing framework. Unlike other studies, this study includes transaction costs and considers how costs change over the life of the contract. The results indicate that savings of 37 per cent were achieved in the first year of contract operation ?savings that were achieved through a combination of reductions in pay and conditions, labour-saving technological change and reductions in inefficiency. Secondly, the dissertation considered why the level of savings achieved fell to 24 per cent following contract variations at the end of year 1. Some evidence indicated that this may have been due to opportunistic behaviour or hold-up: that the contract service provider may have taken advantage of contractual incompleteness and increased its price during the course of contract renegotiations. Although hold-up is an important theme in the literature on contracts, little empirical work has been undertaken in verifying its existence. Thirdly, the impact of contract design on the efficiency of outsourcing arrangements was analysed. It is well known that contract theory predicts a trade-off between incentives and risk. Using the standard principal-agent framework, a simple model is developed to analyse the effects of demand uncertainty on the risk-incentive trade-off. This model is then tested using data from maintenance services contracts at two corporatised water retailers in Melbourne: an environment that is characterised by high levels of both cost and demand uncertainty. Using a general linear regression model, the results obtained indicate that the moral hazard effect dominated the risk premium effect.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Public onctracts--Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Contracting out--Government policy--Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Transaction costs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematic analysis of the upper limb during anatomical and functional movements in healthy children</field><field name="creator">Dwan, Leanne Nicole, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Impairments of upper limb function can negatively impact an individual???s ability to carry out everyday tasks. Children with cerebral palsy can have limitations of upper limb movement due to physiological and structural changes in their body. Current treatment regimes for children with upper limb involvement of cerebral palsy are assessed using a variety of qualitative assessment tools. These measures rely on subjective input from the assessor, and can be insensitive to significant functional improvements.  Research methods in upper limb motion analysis are developing towards use as clinical tools. To date, there is a paucity of knowledge on the quantitative measures of range of motion (ROM) and function of upper limbs in healthy children. There is also lack of agreement on repeatable functional tasks of the upper limb for 3D measurement. The identification of a repeatable task in healthy children would facilitate the use of upper limb 3D motion analysis to guide clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.  This thesis aims to describe upper limb joint range of movement in each degree of freedom and present normative three dimensional kinematic data of upper limb movement in healthy children during a repeatable upper limb functional task. This will provide a basis for comparison to children with movement disorders for future research and clinical practice.  The UNSW kinematic upper limb model was found to successfully measure three dimensional upper limb anatomical and functional movements in healthy children. Normative kinematic data are reported for anatomical movements and two functional tasks.  The results of the studies undertaken showed that differences in dominant and non-dominant limbs were present during anatomical and functional movements. Joint angles measured were found to be repeatable in healthy children. The results suggest that methods used were reliable for investigating upper limb kinematics. Functional movement time-series data were found to be repeatable for the group with the exception of wrist flexion/extension during the hand to mouth movement for both the dominant and non-dominant limbs.  These findings improve current knowledge on upper limb kinematics in healthy children. This knowledge can assist the investigation of movement disorders in children to facilitate clinical decision making.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functional</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Upper Limb</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contrast</field><field name="creator">Pursell, Finn, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages the contrast phenomenon in its various manifestations across the different sense modalities in order to assess the plausibility of contrast as a general perceptual principle. There is some question as to whether contrast may spill over into modalities it is not commonly associated with. In particular, a number of researchers have argued that contrast occurs in audition and has similarities to the brightness contrast illusion in visual perception. For example, studies of noise pitch have noted similar psychophysical properties to brightness contrast and invoked the same underlying neural mechanism. Furthermore, there is some suggestion that contrast may come in a non-simultaneous form characterised by perceptual exaggerations arising from the contrasting spectral content of successive auditory stimuli. The speech perception literature on context effects are engaged as it is in this domain that there is some evidence for non-simultaneous contrast. A study was conducted in which 34 subjects were presented synthesized tokens of "da" and "ga" diotically and dichotically following the precursors "al" and "ar". Significantly more "da" identifications were observed (F=62.85, p=.000) following "ar" precursors when stimuli were presented diotically, whereas no significant effects were observed in identifications of the target for different precursors (F=.553, p=.457) when targets were presented to the ear contralateral to that of the precursor. Results fail to support an explanation of the context effect in the form of a causal mechanism with a central locus. Rather, the locus of the context effect can only be hypothesized to occur at the periphery of the nervous system. This suggests that auditory contrast may be a plausible explanation for the context effect, and which if correct, may be a universal phenomenon common to all people regardless of environment and acquired knowledge. Given these results, contrast is explored more broadly. As generic use of the term is often encountered in musical contexts, aspects of music perception relating to contrast are examined. Some theoretical ideas are put forward in this capacity, focusing on an interactive neural network approach to understanding hypothetical structural contrasts, including tonal contrasts. The thesis closes with a consideration of contrast-like effects that may be of some relevance towards understanding contrast more generally.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of the mechanisms of immune system regulation of inflammation by the human protein, Chaperonin 10</field><field name="creator">Scott, Melissa Margaret Eve, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chaperonin 10 (Cpn10) is a mitochondrial protein with protein folding function. There is substantial evidence that extracellular Cpn10 regulates the immune response. Prior research has shown that Cpn10 binds to T cells, inhibits LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cell- and healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-activation, and downregulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced membrane distribution of the MHC II molecule on dendritic cells (DC). Recent Phase IIa rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials demonstrate improved disease amelioration with Cpn10. Despite compelling evidence of the anti-inflammatory properties of Cpn10, the precise mechanisms of action are unknown. The principal aim was to characterise the modulation of inflammation by Cpn10 and in the process create a bioassay that would allow for the reliable assessment of batch-to-batch variability of Cpn10 preparations. For this purpose, a Cpn10 bioassay was performed in the RAW264.7 cell line and expanded to DC and T cell lines. Furthermore, the analysis of gene expression in healthy donor PBMC was performed, as a mixed cell population experiment, to reflect possible involvement of cell-to-cell communication pathways. Initial data showed that Cpn10 reduced LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor ?? (TNF??) expression in RAW264.7 cells. However, the Cpn10 preparation was shown to contain trace lipid contaminants, which induced cellular tolerance, resulting in the observed reduction in TNF??. Experiments with a second batch of Cpn10 showed no reduction of LPS-induced TNF?? in the RAW264.7 cells, seen with the primary batch of Cpn10 and previously reported characterisation of Cpn10. The Cpn10 bioassay conducted in DC and T cell lines was shown to have the potential to decrease toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) expression, suggesting that Cpn10 may attenuate immune responses by downregulating receptor recognition of bacterial components. The Cpn10 bioassay conducted in LPS-stimulated PBMCs revealed that Cpn10 downregulates gene expression of Th1 related genes including the polarising cytokines IL-7, IL-12B and IL-23A and Th2 related genes including the transcriptions factors GATA3, GFI1 and CEBPB. The downregulation of these genes may play an immuno-modulatory role, having improved efficacy of Cpn10 in T cell mediated autoimmune diseases, with possible therapeutic implications in Th2 mediated diseases such as asthma. The research carried out in this thesis provides insight into the success of Cpn10 in the RA, MS and psoriasis clinical trials. These results have also supported previously published data and provide additional insight into the mechanism of action of Cpn10. In addition, a Cpn10 bioassay has been established using healthy donor PBMCs stimulated with LPS and results show a reduced expression of Th1 and Th2 associated genes. The findings that in mixed cell populations, Cpn10 downregulates not only genes involved in Th1 polarisation mainly at the signal 3 level, but is also capable of downregulating Th2 polarising genes at the signal 1 level of TCR mediated transcription factors, are of particular interest. Ultimately, research from this project has confirmed the anti-inflammatory action of Cpn10 and given useful insight into how Cpn10 acts to modulate the inflammatory response.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anti-inflammatory</field><field name="subject">Cpn10</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">LPS</field><field name="subject">T helper 1 and 2</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Search in personal spaces</field><field name="creator">Penev, Alexander , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Technology surrounds us with many daily Search tasks. However, there is a fundamental difference---one of user familiarity and control---that differentiates between search tasks in impersonal and personal search spaces. The World Wide Web itself is largely unknown, unfamiliar and impersonal to a user. In contrast, users regularly search in more `personal' spaces, such as their own files, their web history, bookmarks, downloads, and so on. These spaces are personal because the user has more knowledge, familiarity and control over their content. A byproduct of these qualities is that search in personal spaces is typically navigational: to navigate through or to recover familiar information. This differs from web search, where very often a user is trying to discover new or unknown information. This important difference in search intent means that there are often few `correct' results for a query in personal spaces, which is something we must keep in mind when implementing search algorithms.  This thesis leverages structure and metadata to build novel algorithms for improving search in several important personal search spaces: finding a file in a file hierarchy, website navigation on a mobile phone browser, tag-based search in an online bookmarking system, and sponsoring content on mobiles. The proposed methods are highly practical and applicable to current real-life search problems that affect millions of users.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular alterations during immortalisation of human endothelial cells</field><field name="creator">Wen, Victoria Wei-Yu, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Replicative exhaustion of endothelial cells (ECs) contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related vascular disorders, including atherosclerosis and impaired wound healing. Conversely, abnormal proliferation of ECs underlies the development of EC-derived malignancies, such as haemangioblastoma and angiosarcoma. The central objective of this thesis was to delineate mechanisms that regulate the replicative lifespan of human ECs and molecular alterations that occur during immortalisation of ECs. The gradual shortening of telomeres (chromosome-end structures) is one mechanism that restricts the replicative lifespan of human ECs. Telomere shortening initiates an irreversible growth arrest or senescence through activation of a TP53-mediated DNA damage response. Expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4a, is also increased and reinforces senescence via the retinoblastoma pathway. Overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) reconstitutes telomerase activity and extends the lifespan of human ECs, but is not sufficient for immortalisation. The current study demonstrated that p16INK4a repression by promoter methylation was a frequent event during immortalisation of hTERT-transduced bone marrow ECs (BMECs), occurring in 5 of 12 clones. Repression of p16INK4a concurred with the development of recurring chromosomal aberrations, which appeared to be a consequence of telomere dysfunction and chromosome fusions. Loss of p16INK4a and the development of a complex karyotype were associated with a more transformed phenotype in hTERT-immortalised BMECs. The investigations described in this thesis were the first to associate loss of p16INK4a expression with the accumulation of chromosome aberrations. Repression of p16INK4a in only a subset of immortal BMECs provided impetus for investigating whether there was a functionally analogous defect in the hTERT-immortalised BMECs that retained p16INK4a expression. In normal human cells, oncogenic Ras upregulates p16INK4a and induces senescence independently of telomere shortening. This thesis demonstrates that the immortal BMECs that retained p16INK4a expression had a defective response to oncogenic Ras, which may have contributed to the immortalisation of these cells. Whole genome and proteome analyses identified additional alterations in gene copy number and protein expression specific to p16INK4a-positive or -negative immortal BMECs. Overall, these investigations provide new insight to the potential consequences of p16INK4a repression during carcinogenesis and describe novel molecular alterations that occur during immortalisation of human ECs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hTERT</field><field name="subject">Endothelial</field><field name="subject">p16INK4a</field><field name="subject">Immortalisation</field><field name="subject">Telomere</field><field name="subject">Telomerase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Don DeLillo's promiscuous fictions:the adulterous triangle of sex, space, and language</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Diana Marie, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis takes up J. G. Ballard's contention, that 'the act of intercourse is now always a model for something else,' to show that Don DeLillo uses a particular sexual, cultural economy of adultery, understood in its many loaded cultural and literary contexts, as a model for semantic reproduction. I contend that DeLillo's fiction evinces a promiscuous model of language that structurally reflects the myth of the adulterous triangle. The thesis makes a significant intervention into DeLillo scholarship by challenging Paul Maltby's suggestion that DeLillo's linguistic model is Romantic and pure. My analysis of the narrative operations of adultery in his work reveals the alternative promiscuous model. I discuss ten DeLillo novels and one play - Americana, Players, The Names, White Noise, Libra, Mao II,Underworld, the play Valparaiso, The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, and the pseudonymousAmazons - that feature adultery narratives. I demonstrate that these narratives resist conservative models of language, space, and sex by using promiscuity as a method of narrative control. I argue that DeLillo's adultery narratives respond subversively to attempts to categorise his work, and that he extends the mythologised rhetoric of the adulterous triangle by adopting sexual transgression as a three-sided semantic structure that connects language, sex, and space. I refer to theories of narrative, postmodernity, space, desire, and parody to show that DeLillo's adultery narratives structurally influence his experiments with linguistic meaning. My analysis reveals that contradiction performs at several spatial, sexual, and dialogical levels to undermine readings that suggest DeLillo's language models pure meaning. I identify the sexualised fissure within DeLillo's semantic style that is exposed by the operation of contradiction. I believe this gap distinguishes DeLillo from postmodern fiction's emphasis on the placeless, because it is a meaningful space that emphasises the reproductive adulteration of signification. I expose several sites of dialectic rupture, including the hotel/motel room, oppositional and metaphorical description, the journey, the image, and the secret. I contend that sex in these transgressive narratives is a model for something else: promiscuous meaning. This thesis demonstrates that DeLillo's fiction charts the typography of the mythical third side of the adulterous triangle in order to respond to language's own promiscuity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DeLillo, Don - Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Adultery in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of instruction memory for embedded systems</field><field name="creator">Janapsatya, Andhi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents methodologies for improving system performance and energy consumption by optimizing the memory hierarchy performance. The processor-memory performance gap is a well-known problem that is predicted to get worse, as the performance gap between processor and memory is widening. The author describes a method to estimate the best L1 cache configuration for a given application. In addition, three methods are presented to improve the performance and reduce energy in embedded systems by optimizing the instruction memory. Performance estimation is an important procedure to assess the performance of the system and to assess the effectiveness of any applied optimizations. A cache memory performance estimation methodology is presented in this thesis. The methodology is designed to quickly and accurately estimate the performance of multiple cache memory configurations. Experimental results showed that the methodology is on average 45 times faster compared to a widely used tool (Dinero IV). The first optimization method is a software-only method, called code placement, was implemented to improve the performance of instruction cache memory. The method involves careful placement of code within memory to ensure high cache hit rate when code is brought into the cache memory. Code placement methodology aims to improve cache hit rates to improve cache memory performance. Experimental results show that by applying the code placement method, a reduction in cache miss rate by up to 71%, and energy consumption reduction of up to 63% are observed when compared to application without code placement. The second method involves a novel architecture for utilizing scratchpad memory. The scratchpad memory is designed as a replacement of the instruction cache memory. Hardware modification was designed to allow data to be written into the scratchpad memory during program execution, allowing dynamic control of the scratchpad memory content. Scratchpad memory has a faster memory access time and a lower energy consumption per access compared to cache memory; the usage of scratchpad memory aims to improve performance and lower energy consumption of systems compared to system with cache memory. Experimental results show an average energy reduction of 26.59% and an average performance improvement of 25.63% when compared to a system with cache memory. The third is an application profiling method using statistical information to identify application???s hot-spots. Application profiling is important for identifying section in the application where performance degradation might occur and/or where maximum performance gain can be obtained through optimization. The method was applied and tested on the scratchpad based system described in this thesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the analysis method in reducing energy and improving performance when compared to previous method for utilizing the scratchpad memory based system (average performance improvement of 23.6% and average energy reduction of 27.1% are observed).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Cache memory</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the mechanism of action of the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin: drug-DNA interactions in reconstituted chromatin and human gene expression profiling</field><field name="creator">Galea, Anne Marie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The DNA-damaging compound, cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum (II)), is a highly successful anti-tumour agent widely used in the treatment of a range of human cancers. Despite the clinical efficacy of cisplatin, its curative potential is largely restricted by the occurrence of drug resistance and several dose-limiting toxic side effects. Attempts to ameliorate these deficiencies have met with limited success. However, it is ultimately hoped that such efforts will benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which cisplatin elicits tumourspecific cytotoxicity. The overall aim of this project was to further elucidate the mechanism of action of cisplatin. For this purpose, different experimental approaches were employed to examine the interaction of cisplatin with DNA, and the drug???s effect on human gene expression. Firstly, chromatin structures native to DNA in human cells were simulated in vitro via reconstitution techniques. Their effect on cisplatin-mediated DNA damage could then be evaluated. Various cisplatin analogues and other DNA-damaging compounds were also investigated in this model system. Secondly, the transcriptional response of human cells to cisplatin treatment was analysed using microarrays and gene expression profiling techniques. Transcript profiles compiled for cisplatin and its clinically ineffective isomer, transplatin, were compared to establish a possible relationship between compound-specific responses and therapeutic efficiency. To assess the relative influence of individual chromatin elements on cisplatin- DNA interactions, the first part of this study employed the octamer transfer method of nucleosome reconstitution to create a defined experimental construct. Standard footprinting techniques allowed the precise location of two positioned nucleosomes to be established with respect to the DNA sequence. The construct was then subjected to drug treatment and the resulting DNA damage was quantitatively analysed using a Taq DNA polymerase stop assay. At sites of damage, densitometric comparisons between purified and reconstituted DNA were used to evaluate the influence of nucleosomal core proteins on specific drug-DNA interactions. For cisplatin and most of the other DNAdamaging agents studied, this method revealed regions of the construct that were relatively protected from drug-induced damage. These regions corresponded to the sites  of the positioned nucleosome cores and indicated that the preferred site of DNA binding for these compounds was in the linker region of the construct. Statistical analyses confirmed the significant level of damage protection conferred by the nucleosome cores and exposed subtle differences between the agents examined. Most prominent among the trends observed, was the negative correlation between compound size and the relative propensity for damaging nucleosomal core DNA. Larger compounds generally displayed a greater tendency to target the linker region of the nucleosomal DNA. In contrast, the access of smaller molecules was not impeded as significantly. In the second stage of the project, the effect of cisplatin on human gene expression levels was described using 19000-gene microarrays and transcription profiling methods. In cultured human cells, cisplatin treatment was shown to significantly up- and down-regulate consistent subsets of genes. Many of these genes responded similarly to treatment with transplatin, the therapeutically inactive isomer of cisplatin. However, a smaller proportion of these transcripts underwent differential expression changes in response to the two isomers. Some of these genes may constitute part of the DNA damage response induced by cisplatin that is critical for its anti-tumour activity. Ultimately, the identification of gene expression responses unique to clinically active compounds, like cisplatin, could thus greatly benefit the design and development of improved chemotherapeutics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cisplatin</field><field name="subject">Human genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapists' experience of working with suicidal clients</field><field name="creator">Rossouw, Gabriel Johannes</field><field name="description">This study explores therapists' experience of working with suicidal clients. Using a Hermeneutic-phenomenological method informed by Heidegger [1889 &#8211; 1976] this study provides an understanding of the meaning of therapists' experiences from their perspective as mental health professionals in New Zealand. Study participants include thirteen therapists working as mental health professionals in District Health Boards from the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology and psychiatric nursing. Participants' narratives of their experiences of working with suicidal clients were captured via audio taped interviewing. These stories uncover the everyday realities facing therapists and provide an ontological understanding of their experiences working with suicidal clients in District Health Boards. The findings of this study identified three themes. All the participants experienced shock and surprise upon hearing their clients had committed suicide without presenting with signs and symptoms associated with suicidality in their assessment. All the participants experienced the responsibility of assessing suicidal clients and intervening to be a burden. Further, they suffered from guilt and fear of punishment in the aftermath of a client's suicide. They also found themselves in a professional and personal crisis as a result of their experiences and struggled to come to terms with events. This study has shown how these experiences could be understood by uncovering the perspectives therapists bring to working with suicidal clients. I have shown how mainstream prevention and intervention strategies follow on from the misrepresentation and misinterpretation of our traditional way of knowing what it means to be human. I show when therapists discover that phenomena are not necessarily what they appear to be they feel unsettled and confused about their responsibilities and what it means to live and die as a human being. The experience of being a therapist to a person who commits suicide has been revealed in this thesis to leave a profound legacy of guilt, doubt and fear. This thesis proposes that it may be time for the profession to care for its own that therapists in turn may not shy back from caring for and about the vulnerable other.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heideggerian Hermeneutic Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Therapists'</field><field name="subject">Work with suicide</field><field name="subject">Effect of client suicide on therapists</field><field name="subject">Suicide and supervision</field><field name="subject">Institutionalised care and suicide</field><field name="subject">Therapists'</field><field name="subject">Sense of responsibilty and suicide</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching programming strategies explicitly to novice
programmers</field><field name="creator">de Raadt, Michael</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The traditional approach to training novice programmers has been to provide explicit programming knowledge instruction but to rely on implicit instruction of programming strategies. Studies, reported in literature, have discovered universally poor results on standardised tests for novices studying under this traditional approach.This dissertation describes the explicit integration of programming strategies into instruction and assessment of novice programmers, and the impact of this change ontheir learning outcomes.An initial experiment was used to measure the performance of students studying under a traditional curriculum with implicitly taught programming strategies. Thisexperiment uncovered common flaws in the strategy skills of novices and revealed weaknesses in the curriculum. Incorporation of explicit strategy instruction wasproposed.To validate a model of strategies as being authentic and appropriate for novice instruction, an experiment with experts was conducted. Experts were asked to solvethree problems that a novice would typically be expected to solve at the end of an introductory programming course. Experts&#8223; solutions were analysed using Goal/PlanAnalysis and it was discovered that experts consistently applied plans, the subalgorithmic strategies suggested by Soloway (1986). It was proposed that plans could be adapted for explicit inclusion in an introductory programming curriculum.Initially a curriculum incorporating explicit strategy instruction was tested in an artificial setting with a small number of volunteers, divided into control andexperimental groups. The control group was taught using a simplified traditional curriculum and the experimental group were exposed to a curriculum which explicitly included programming strategies. Testing revealed that experimental group participants applied plans more than control group participants, who had been expected to learn these strategies implicitly. In interviews, experimental participants used strategy-related terminology and were more confident in the solutions they had created. These results justified a trial of the curriculum in an actual introductory programming course.When explicit instruction of programming strategies was incorporated into an actual introductory programming curriculum, novices achieved superior results whencompared to results from the initial experiment. Novices used strategies significantly more when these strategies were incorporated explicitly into instructional materialsand assessment items.This series of experiments focussed on explicitly teaching specific programming strategies rather than teaching problem-solving more generally. These experimentalresults demonstrate that explicit incorporation of programming strategies may improve outcomes for novices and potentially improve the potential of expertprogrammers in future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">programmers;</field><field name="subject">novice;</field><field name="subject">inexperienced;</field><field name="subject">training;</field><field name="subject">teaching;</field><field name="subject">instruction;</field><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004827/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation of an integrated approach to sustainable water management in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Vo, Phu Le</field><field name="description">In 1986, Vietnam opened up the country&#8217;s economy by launching the Doi Moi (renovation) policy, which made the process of economic liberalisation possible. Accordingly, Ho Chi Minh City, the country&#8217;s biggest city, has undergone rapid growth of population, urbanisation and industrialisation. While achieving remarkable economic growth, the city faces considerable urban environmental challenges. The rapid growth of urbanisation and industry has placed increasing pressure on available freshwater resources, through excessive water use and increasing volumes of untreated wastewater. Firstly, the urban water sector has had to meet growing demand for water use for domestic purposes during the dry season. Secondly, groundwater levels have experienced a substantial drawdown in outlying urban districts as a result of over-abstraction. Thirdly, rapidly expanding industrial activities are causing severe demand on water resources. The city&#8217;s major supply sources have developed an alarming level of pollutants discharged by industry.  The aim of this thesis is to formulate an integrated approach to the sustainable management of water resources in Ho Chi Minh City. In order to achieve this, the research was designed to examine institutional frameworks and arrangements and to explore the perception of water value by water users and stakeholders. The underlying reasons for ineffective management are anchored in fragmented management practices which result from inadequate institutional frameworks and arrangements, inadequate regulations and inappropriate water governance. Weak enforcement of law and insufficient cooperation between government agencies and departments in Ho Chi Minh City and their counterparts in neighbouring provinces also limit management efficacy.  The research results show that stakeholders have different perceptions of water resources. Overall, water value has been considered as a social and economic good by both the urban respondents and government officials. However, most urban residents view water as a social good rather than an economic one. Public involvement in the water sector is limited. Most urban dwellers have little understanding and knowledge about the city&#8217;s water issues or the available channels to access information on water resources.  Many government officials are inadequately trained, poorly qualified, inexperienced and have irrelevant or outdated background knowledge about their field of management. Government respondents did not provide consistent data and information on the water profile because there is no shared common information on water issues in place. Findings from the fieldwork show that decentralisation, privatisation and using rainwater as a potential alternative water source are preferred.  Finally, the study proposes a schematic revision of existing management structures and mechanisms between local government agencies. This thesis proposes a model for a water conservation strategy for which the management and use of water resources is aligned with adequate institutional arrangements and effective regulations. Water governance and management of water resources need to work with economic and urbanisation growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formulation; Integrated approach; Water management; Ho Chi Minh City; Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor receptors in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Brierley, Gemma Victoria</field><field name="description">The IGF system is a crucial regulator of normal growth and development, however dysregulation of the system on multiple levels is associated with the incidence of a wide variety of malignancies including the breast, thyroid, lung, and colon, making the IGF system an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. Due to its role in mediating cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis, traditional focus has been set on examining the role of the type 1 IGF receptor [IGF1R] in cancer. However there is mounting evidence to suggest the insulin receptor [IR] may also be involved in the potentiation and pathogenesis of cancers. The observation that IGF-II is overexpressed, compared to normal tissues, by cancers suggests signaling via target receptors by this ligand has important implications on cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, both the IGF1R and IR have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in a variety of malignancies. In regards to IR isoform, the IGF-II binding IR-A is preferentially expressed by a number of cancer cell types. Together with the observation that an autocrine proliferative loop exists between IGF-II and the IR-A in malignant thyrocytes and cultured breast cancer cells, suggests signaling via the IR-A may play a role in cancer cell growth and survival. However, very few studies on the IR-A have been conducted in cells co-expressing the IGF1R. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with discrimination between signaling arising from IGF1R homodimers, IR-A homodimers, and IGF1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. It is not known how the IR-A interacts, and functions in conjunction with the other receptors of the IGF system to signal biologically relevant outcomes, especially in terms of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to block and down-regulate the IGF1R. Current anti-cancer therapies targeting the IGF system have concentrated on blocking IGF signaling via the IGF1R, due mostly to the functional properties of the receptor, but also in part due to the metabolic consequences associated with blockade and inhibition of the IR. This individual targeting of the IGF1R potentially leaves a pathway by which IGF-II secreted by the tumour can circumvent current IGF1R based therapies. Consequently, this thesis investigated whether the IR-A could compensate for the targeted loss of the IGF1R and how the IR-A interacts with the IGF1R in cells co-expressing these two receptors. In addition, the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation was assessed. The main experimental techniques used throughout this body of work included; assessment of protein expression and activation by Western blot, siRNA mediated gene silencing, and measures of cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The key areas of investigation included: 1. Investigation of the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation 2. Identification of an appropriate cell line model in which to investigate the interactions between the IR-A and IGF1R 3. Optimisation of siRNA mediated knock-down of the IR-A and IGF1R in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells 4. Determination of the biological role of the IR-A in SW480 cells co-expressing the IGF1R The key findings from this work included: 1. The IR-A could not compensate for IGF1R depletion in SW480 cells 2. Dual silencing of the IR-A and IGF1R indicated signaling via the IGF1R was dominant to signaling via the IR-A in SW480 cells 3. Signaling via IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors may not be as potent as signaling via IGF1R homodimers 4. IGF-I at physiological concentrations can stimulate biological responses via both isoforms of the IR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factors; cancer; colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell receptors.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of strengthened unreinforced masonry (URM) walls by new retrofitting technologies for blast loading.</field><field name="creator">Su, Yu</field><field name="description">Terrorism has become a serious threat in the world, with bomb attacks carried out both inside and outside buildings. There are already many unreinforced masonry buildings in existence, and some of them are historical buildings. However, they do not perform well under blast loading. Aiming on protecting masonry buildings, retrofitting techniques were developed. Some experimental work on studying the effect of retrofitted URM walls has been done in recent years; however, these tests usually cost a significant amount of time and funds. Because of this, numerical simulation has become a good alternative, and can be used to study the behaviour of masonry structures, and predict the outcomes of experimental tests. This project was carried out to find efficient retrofitting technique under blast loading by developing numerical material models. It was based on experimental research of strengthening URM walls by using retrofitting technologies under out-of-plane loading at the University of Adelaide. The numerical models can be applied to study large-scaled structures under static loading, and the research work is then extended to the field of blast loading. Aiming on deriving efficient material models, homogenization technology was introduced to this research. Fifty cases of numerical analysis on masonry basic cell were conducted to derive equivalent orthotropic material properties. To study the increasing capability in strength and ductility of retrofitted URM walls, pull-tests were simulated using interface element model to investigate the bond-slip relationship of FRP plates bonded to masonry blocks. The interface element model was then used to simulate performance of retrofitted URM walls under static loads. The accuracy of the numerical results was verified by comparing with the experimental results from previous tests at the University of Adelaide by Griffith et al. (2007) on unreinforced masonry walls and by Yang (2007) on FRP retrofitted masonry walls. To study the de-bonding behaviours of retrofits bonded to masonry, and find appropriate solution to protect certain masonry walls against blast loading, various retrofitting technologies were examined. The simulation covers explosive impacts of a wide range of impulses. Based on this work, pressure-impulse diagrams for different types of retrofitted URM walls were developed as a design guideline for estimating the blast effect on retrofitted masonry walls. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the development of numerical simulation on modelling retrofitted URM walls, improving the technique for explosion-resistant of masonry buildings, and providing a type of guideline for blast-resistant design.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retrofitting; FRP; Masonry; Blast; Aluminium foam; Spray-on polyurea; Numerical</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Building materials -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Blast effect -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of transition metal acetylides for broadband optical limiters.</field><field name="creator">Van Galen, Yvonne Jansen</field><field name="description">Title page, abstract and table of contents only.

In particular, it examines how representative theories on both sides are based on claims about our human nature as reasoning, self- determining, individual agents; and claims about how this nature may be fulsomely expressed or inhibited under different kinds of socio-political conditions. I show that broadly naturalistic claims of this sort support normative claims about aspects of our nature we ought to value, and about the kind of political system we ought to prefer. Social-liberals and libertarians disagree about how human capacities for reasoning, self-determining agency will tend to fare within a liberal State-free market political system. This leads them to different conclusions about the role of the State. The overall approach is to test the relevant claims about our nature and social psychology against current theory and evidence in cognitive neuroscience and epidemiology, and then to interpret the normative implications for each political position. At the heart of the project is a neuroscience-based model of capacities for everyday social reasoning and decision making (&#8216;SRD&#8217; capacities), which I claim offers a plausible, evidence-based account of universal human capacities which both social-liberals and libertarians claim to value. Once in place, the model is employed for critical analysis of data in epidemiological research into aspects of mental health within Western populations. I conclude that certain socioeconomic circumstances commonly encountered within Western societies causally contribute to detrimental impacts on SRD capacities, in the form of psychiatric disorders or diversion behaviours. This material is then used to reinterpret the normative claims of libertarians and social- liberals. I argue that the kind of political system recommended by libertarians will tend to generate conditions which have significant detrimental effects on SRD capacities, which they claim to value; and do so to a greater extent than a social-liberal system. This puts libertarians out of step with their own basic values and initial arguments justifying a liberal State. The libertarian system will also tend to create significant social risks and costs, to the point of being self-undermining. A social-liberal system will tend to mitigate these risks and costs. Thus I argue that, if SRD capacities are regarded as valuable, we have reason to prefer a social-liberal system over a libertarian system. However, in the light of the proposed model, I claim that the &#8216;standard&#8217; form of contemporary social-liberal politics and programs also has weaknesses. Familiar forms of egalitarian social program partially address some social conditions implicated in undermining SRD capacities, but there are other aspects of the problem which are outrunning the usual methods. The associated risks and liabilities are still cause for prudential concern. A more creative and psychologically astute politics is required. In conclusion I make a number of proposals in that direction, and claim that the project as a whole offers elements of a new social-liberal theory.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political philosophy; Liberalism; Libertarianism; Reason; Decision making; Neuroscience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bandwidth allocation for quality of service provision in IEEE 802.16 systems.</field><field name="creator">Tang, Tze Wei</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates various aspects of bandwidth allocation and scheduling in the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of IEEE 802.16 systems. We highlight the important aspects of designing a scheduler and describe the scheduler design problem from a general perspective. That is, we provide a scheduler design framework driven by a set of objectives defined for the systems. In addition, we include Subscriber Station differentiation into our scheduler design. This approach is comprehensive, as it covers the requirements of both the network provider and the end users. In developing the framework, we discuss the importance of achieving customer satisfaction. This leads to an interesting objective that maximises the number of satisfied customers, rather than network centric objectives, such as fairness. We contend that providing fairness to customers does not necessarily achieve the best outcome for customer satisfaction and artificially limits the choices available to service providers. In order to maximise the number of satisfied customers, we analyse in detail the Dual-Queue (DQ) scheduling discipline proposed by Hayes et al. [2]. The DQ algorithms of Hayes&#8217; work are focused on wireline networks, and are not directly deployable in an 802.16 environment, as we discuss in this thesis. We propose a modified DQ implementation for 802.16 systems to handle real-time services. In 802.16 systems, there are two scheduling processes that we need to consider: Downlink (DL) scheduling for data transmission from the Base Station to the Subscriber Stations and Uplink (UL) scheduling for data transmission from the Subscriber Stations to the Base Stations. We investigate the DL and UL implementations separately because the UL scheduling process is more complicated due to the fundamentally distributed nature of the problem. We demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to operate effectively in an 802.16 system. We then compare the performance of our proposed DL and UL Dual- Queue schedulers to a Weighted Fair Queue scheduler in noisy environments, where re-transmissions are required. In addition, we also compare our proposed schedulers to an enhanced Weighted Fair Queue scheduler with an Explicit Packet Dropping mechanism. Furthermore, we show that our Dual-Queue system can handle mixed traffic profiles, such as video and voice. Having proposed a DQ implementation that maximises the number of satisfied customers, we investigate alternative objectives that the DQ scheduler may try to achieve. We find that our proposed DQ implementation may fail to achieve these alternative objectives, and hence, we remedy this shortfall by proposing the Priority- Based Dual-Queue scheduler, which is made up of multiple DQs differentiated by the priority classes of connections. That is, each priority class is handled in a separate DQ. The Priority-Based Dual-Queue scheduler ensures connections that belong to the highest priority class are served ahead of connections that belong to lower priority classes at all times, even when there are changes in the priority class of connections in the system. Lastly, we investigate the benefits of carrying out the DQ scheduling for both the DL and UL of an 802.16 network jointly. We first investigate a scenario where the network consists of only one-directional connections. We propose a joint scheme that is able to maximise the number of satisfied one-directional connections in the network. We then extend our investigation to another scenario where the network consists of bi-directional sessions, such as Voice over IP and video conferencing. In this case, we propose two joint schemes, which are able to maximise the number of satisfied bi-directional sessions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of service; IEEE 802.16; dual-queue; WiMAX</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of antimicrobial compounds synthesised by Microcystis sp.</field><field name="creator">Victory, Kyleigh Jane</field><field name="description">Cyanobacterial secondary metabolites, often identified as toxins such as microcystin, have also demonstrated biological functions including inhibition of bacterial and viral growth. In this study, 10 cyanobacterial strains were isolated from field sites around Adelaide and laboratory cultures and assessed for bioactivity against bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. A comprehensive literature search identified a number of screening assays employed by research groups to identify cyanobacterial strains with biological activity. Within the review, methods to optimise extraction of the compounds were also noted. Combinations of extraction methods, solvents and assay procedures were investigated to optimise the success of this phase of the study. Bioactivity was confirmed by development of agar disc diffusion and microtitre plate assays to analyse cyanobacterial biomass extracts. Result of the assays indicated a methanolic extract of one species, Microcystis flos-aquae (Wittr Elenkin), inhibited growth of bacterial cells and viral infectivity and was selected for further analysis. The bioactive compound was isolated by HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis. Separation of the bioactive extract into component peaks indicated only one that was likely to represent the metabolite of interest, at a retention time of approximately 18 min. A second profile was constructed of a methanolic extract of the same species in a later growth stage that did not inhibit growth of either the bacterial or viral test organisms. Comparison of the profiles exposed the absence of the peak at 18 min retention time in the second profile. Accumulation of the fraction was conducted using a semi-preparative HPLC column for analysis by mass spectrometry. A sample of the isolated peptide was submitted to Proteomics International, a subsidiary of Murdoch University, WA, for identification and structural characterisation. Proteomics International analysed the data by electronspray ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (LC/MS/TOF) followed by LC. De novo sequence analysis of the data was carried out using Analyst QS software; however, PI was unable to provide a readily interpretable, continuous amino acid sequence, despite their admission that some gaps in the fragmentation ladder corresponded to known amino acids. Interpretation of the data generated by Proteomics International by a research chemist within the University of Adelaide proposed the following amino acid sequence and subsequent structure for the compound: [Figures omitted] Proposed (a) amino acid sequence and (b) structure for the bioactive compound isolated from non-toxic M. flos-aquae. Comparison of the proposed sequence with those contained in peptide databases was unable to classify the compound (B Neilan, personal communication, April 2008), suggesting the bioactive metabolite is perhaps previously undetected and therefore may be considered a novel compound, or has undergone a modification and is thus a variant of a known compound. Taxonomic classification of the strain used during this study was completed by PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA, using primers from alternative cyanobacterial sources. The sequence was classified in the following taxonomic hierarchy (with 100% assignment detail, for a confidence threshold of 95%): Domain: Bacteria Phylum Cyanobacteria Class Cyanobacteria Family Family 1.1 Genus Microcystis This classification confirms that the species investigated during this research is of the genus Microcystis. Synthesis of cyanobacterial metabolites is generally accepted to be a result of nonribosomal synthetic pathways. The presence of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthetase genes in Microcystis flos-aquae was confirmed by PCR amplification using degenerate primers from other cyanobacterial sources. Analysis of sequence data identified the presence of an NRPS gene demonstrating significant similarity (98%) to the NRPS cyanopeptolin gene of Microcystis sp. However, the PKS (polyketide) gene identified verified only a 63% similarity to a known sequence, that of the PKS (mcyG) gene of M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (Koch). Results of the molecular investigation imply this compound may belong within the cyanopeptolin family. Researchers have speculated that the majority of cyanobacteria possess genes for production of toxins, though in many instances the gene cluster may be incomplete or one or more genes may be absent or mutated. The presence of microcystin genes was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers from previously characterised cyanobacterial genes. Analysis of the sequence data identified the presence of several mcy genes generally found in toxic strains of cyanobacteria noted for synthesis of the toxin microcystin. The DNA sequences show significant similarity to the mcyA, mcyC, mcyD and mcyE genes described for Microcystis sp. and Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806. However, analysis of the sequence data for the mcyB gene revealed that this gene was not present. Further PCR amplification of the region between mcyA and mcyC using the reverse complements of the original primers indicated that a sequence was present that may have been a truncated variant of mcyB or another gene entirely. Time constraints prohibited submission of this region for sequence analysis. The primary objective of this research project was to screen a field strain of cyanobacteria for synthesis of biologically active secondary metabolites, and to isolate those compounds using a combination of analytical chemistry and molecular biotechnology.

Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological investigations of surveillance strategies of zoonotic Salmonella : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Benschop, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the application of recently developed epidemiological and statistical tools to inform the optimisation of a national surveillance strategy of considerable importance to human health. The results of a series of epidemiological investigations of surveillance strategies for zoonotic Salmonella are presented. Salmonella are one of the most common and serious zoonotic foodborne pathogenic bacteria globally. These studies were motivated by the increasing focus on the cost-effectiveness of surveillance while maintaining consumer confidence in food supply. Although data from the Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme has been used in these investigations, the techniques may be readily applied to other surveillance data of similar quality. The first study describes the spatial epidemiological features of Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme data from 1995 to 2004, using a novel method of spatially adaptive smoothing. The conditional probability of a farm being a case was consistently high in the the south-west of Sonderjylland on the Jutland peninsula, identifying this area for further investigation and targeted surveillance. The identification of clustering of case farms led into the next study, which closely examines one year of data, 2003, for patterns of spatial dependency. K-function analyses provided evidence for aggregation of Salmonella case farms over that of all farms at distances of up to six kilometres. Visual semivariogram analyses of random farm-level effects from a Bayesian logistic regression model (adjusted for herd size) of Salmonella seropositivity, revealed spatial dependency between pairs of farms up to a distance of four kilometres apart. The strength of the spatial dependency was positively associated with slaughter pig farm density. We describe how this might inform the surveillance programme by potentially targeting herds within a four kilometre radius of those with high levels of Salmonella infection. In the third study, farm location details, routinely recorded surveillance information, and industry survey data from 1995 were combined to build a logistic seroprevalence model. This identified wet-feeding and specific pathogen free herd health status as protective factors for Salmonella seropositivity, while purchasing feed was a risk factor. Once adjusting for these covariates, we identified pockets of unexplained risk for Salmonella seropositivity and found spatial dependency at distances of up to six km (95% CI: 2&#8211;35 km) between farms. A generalised linear spatial model was fitted to the Jutland data allowing formal estimation of the range of spatial correlation and a measure of the uncertainty about it. There was a large within-farm component to the variance, suggesting that gathering more farm level information would be advantageous if this approach was to be used to target surveillance strategy. The fourth study again considers data from the whole study period, 1995 to 2004. A detailed temporal analysis of the data revealed there was no consistent seasonal pattern and correspondingly no benefit in targeting sampling to particular times of the year. Spatiotemporal analyses suggested a local epidemic of increased seroprevalence occured in west Jutland in late 2000. Lorelogram analyses showed a defined period of statistically significant temporal dependency, suggesting that there is little value in sampling more frequently than every 10 weeks on the average farm. The final study uses findings from the preceding chapters to develop a zero-inflated binomial model which predicts which farms are most at risk of Salmonella, and then preferentially samples these high-risk farms. This type of modelling allows assessment of similarities and differences between factors that affect herd infection status (introduction) and those that affect the seroprevalence in infected herds (persistence and spread). The model suggested that many of the herds where Salmonella was not detected were infected but at a low prevalence. Using cost and sensitivity, we compared the results with those under the standard sampling scheme based on herd size, and the recently introduced risk-based approach.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consolidating mistakes of the heart and mind : toward a dual process theory of regret : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Towers, Andrew James</field><field name="description">There are many idiosyncrasies in the emotion of regret that we do not fully comprehend and our traditional reliance on economic theories of human decision-making, which view regret as stemming from illogical and explicit decision-making processes, may be the cause. This thesis explores the development and testing of the Dual Process Theory of Regret (DPTR) which claims that individuals use both implicit &#8216;orientation&#8217; and explicit &#8216;justification&#8217; systems of thought to guide their daily decision-making and the differential use of these systems should be reflected in the intensity of regret felt for a poor outcome. To assess its utility in predicting variation in regret intensity the DPTR was tested in conjunction with two popular theories of regret; one focussing on the distinction between actions and inaction, and the other focussing on decision justification.  Three thousand adults were randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral roll and invited to participate in a postal survey of short and long-term life regrets. Of this initial sample 653 participants returned questionnaires with usable data, a response rate of approximately 23% which, while a relatively low response rate, was expected given the sensitive topic and provided more than enough respondents for the present analysis.  Results showed that the DPTR had greater utility in predicting trends in short and long-term regret intensity than either of the current regret theories. Results also illustrated that changes in justification strength had little effect on regret intensity and that explicit justifications only influenced regret in the long-term. In contrast results supported the conceptualisation of the implicit orientation and showed that it was a key source of influence on regret intensity in both the short and long-term.  This research concludes that the DPTR&#8217;s focus on both implicit and explicit cognitive systems provides greater insight into the nature of regret than the reliance on explicit cognitive analysis alone. Implicit feelings of right and wrong are a better indicator of eventual regret than our ability to justify our decision. These results help resolve past anomalies in regret research, clarify conflicting trends in regret highlighted in the current media, and have application for understanding criminal recidivism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regret</field><field name="subject">remorse</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluency enhancement : applications to machine translation : thesis for Master of Engineering in Information &amp; Telecommunications Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Manion, Steve Lawrence</field><field name="description">The quality of Machine Translation (MT) can often be poor due to it appearing incoherent and lacking in fluency. These problems consist of word ordering, awkward use of words and grammar, and translating text too literally. However we should not consider translations such as these failures until we have done our best to enhance their quality, or more simply, their fluency. In the same way various processes can be applied to touch up a photograph, various processes can also be applied to touch up a translation. This research outlines the improvement of MT quality through the application of Fluency Enhancement (FE), which is a process we have created that reforms and evaluates text to enhance its fluency. We have tested our FE process on our own MT system which operates on what we call the SAM fundamentals, which are as follows: Simplicity - to be simple in design in order to be portable across different languages pairs, Adaptability - to compensate for the evolution of language, and Multiplicity - to determine a final set of translations from as many candidate translations as possible. Based on our research, the SAM fundamentals are the key to developing a successful MT system, and are what have piloted the success of our FE process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine translating</field><field name="subject">machine translation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280205 Text processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of consuming farmed salmon compared to salmon oil capsules on long chain omega 3 fatty acid and selenium status in humans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Human Nutrition, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pauga, Melanie</field><field name="description">Salmon is a good source of long chain (LC) omega 3 fatty acids and selenium; these are well recognised for their health benefits. Recommendations for LC omega 3 fatty acid intakes presume equivalence between fish and fish oil. The aim of this research was to compare the effects of consuming salmon with salmon oil capsules on LC omega 3 fatty acid and selenium status. Forty four healthy subjects were randomly assigned to consume either two servings of 120 g farmed New Zealand King (FNZK) salmon/week or 2, 4 or 6 capsules of salmon oil/day for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measures, food consumption habits information and blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained at the study commencement and ending. Each subject&#8217;s intake of LC omega 3 fatty acids and selenium was determined by analysing the fatty acid and selenium content of duplicate portions of cooked salmon and capsules. The amount of salmon consumed was then calculated by subtracting unconsumed amounts of salmon and then calculating the intake of LC omega 3 fatty acids as grams of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed per day. Percentage of compliance to capsule intake, based on counts of unconsumed capsules, was calculated to determine the amount of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed per day from capsules. Change in red blood cells (RBC) LC omega 3 fatty acid levels from equivalent amounts of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed from capsules and salmon were compared using linear regression analysis predictive models fitted to the capsule data. Omega 3 index was calculated. LC omega 3 fatty acid intakes from salmon and 2, 4 and 6 capsules were 0.82, 0.24, 0.47 and 0.68 g/day, respectively. Equal amounts of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed from salmon and capsules resulted in similar increases in RBC LC omega 3 fatty acids and omega 3 index (RBC eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): 0.80 [0.58 &#8211; 1.02] vs. 1.00 [0.71 &#8211; 1.27] %; RBC docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): 0.93 [0.58 &#8211; 1.29] vs. 0.99 [0.68 &#8211; 1.31] %; omega 3 index: 1.92 [1.46 &#8211; 2.38] vs. 2.25 [1.65 &#8211; 2.83] %).

Online enrichment activities and social opportunities are only successful if they are able to attract and sustain attention of the advanced interests of gifted children. The aim of the research is to design an online application that appeals to gifted children and recognises the identified intellectual and social needs within the New Zealand context. This was achieved through research through design by establishing a design strategy that uses the findings of investigations and applies them to a prototype application. Developers of online content for gifted children may benefit from this research. As an initial investigation a survey was conducted about how gifted New Zealand primary school children are using online applications. It was assumed following the literature review that online applications would appeal to gifted children if they teach a new skill, have multiplayer functionality and address higher order thinking skills. Basic design characteristics of the most popular gaming websites amongst gifted children (from the survey) were then used to inform the design strategy and to develop the prototype online application typozilla. Key findings were retrieved through observation of gifted children using typozilla. The majority of children observed were especially enthusiastic seeing other players&#8217; avatars within multiplayer areas and competing against each other. They enjoyed learning a new skill (which was touch-typing) and engaging in creative tasks. In interviews all gifted children confirmed that they perceived the typozilla design as appealing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational games design</field><field name="subject">typewriting</field><field name="subject">gifted children education</field><field name="subject">typing</field><field name="subject">typozilla</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon dioxide insufflation during colonoscopy : a randomised controlled trial : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Philosophy (Nursing) at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Cleland, Anne</field><field name="description">Aim To determine that carbon dioxide (CO2), instead of air, insufflated during colonoscopy reduces pain experienced by patients post colonoscopy. Method A randomised, double blinded, controlled trial with 205 consecutive consented patients referred for elective colonoscopy was undertaken at MidCentral Health Gastroenterology Department between July 2008 and January 2009. Patients were randomised to colonic insufflation with either air or CO2. A comparison of reported pain was undertaken using a 0 -10 point numeric rating scale at several time periods; intra procedure, 10, 30, and 60 minutes post procedure. Results The results were analysed using the SPSS programme. CO2 insufflation was used in 108 patients and air in 97 patients. Pain scores 10 minutes after were 0.43 &#177; 1.20 for CO2 and 1.61 &#177; 2.40 for air (P &lt; .0001). 30 minutes after the procedure 90% of patients in the CO2 group reported no pain, compared to 61% of the air group. CO2 significantly reduced the amount of discomfort post colonoscopy at 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Conclusion Those receiving CO2 during colonoscopy experienced less post colonoscopy pain than those who received air insufflation.

A review of the general literature on social inclusion revealed that little research has been conducted in relation to mental health, particularly in New Zealand. Even fewer studies have investigated the meanings that people with severe and enduring mental health problems place on their experiences. A life story narrative approach was employed in order to explore the experience of social inclusion and enduring mental health problems. Data were collected by way of unstructured, individual interviews with five users of mental health services living in supported housing in a small rural New Zealand town. Thematic analysis was carried out on the narratives, identifying six major themes. The findings indicated that, for this group of service users, social inclusion means having someone to love, something to do and somewhere to live. They want relationships with family and friends, to engage in recreational or leisure activities, to be employed, to have financial security, and to have safe and comfortable housing. The major barriers to achieving these are stigma and discrimination. New Zealand&#8217;s mental health services have adopted a recovery approach to mental health. Whereas social inclusion has a broad political and social focus that places responsibility for reducing social exclusion on society, recovery focuses on individuals&#8217; personal journeys towards mental health and well-being. Despite international recognition of the value of social inclusion, New Zealand&#8217;s mental health services have not yet embraced it, although policy advisory organisations such as the Mental Health Commission state its aims as desirable for services. However, the concept of recovery sits within the framework of social inclusion and is an integral part of it. Mental health nurses need to understand what social inclusion means to people who experience it, so that they are able to empower them to make a positive contribution to their community, as citizens, friends, family members, employees and neighbours.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">social inclusion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Desirable models of behaviour" : learning to teach as a rite of passage : an historical study of initial teacher education in New Zealand : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ball, Teresa</field><field name="description">This thesis critically examines the historical construction of initial teacher education at the turn of the 20th century. It focuses particularly on the extent of state involvement in the process of learning to teach, arguing that this process fulfils the necessary conditions of a rite of passage. The investigation utilises a different theoretical and methodological approach which combines the post-structuralist analyses of Michel Foucault with the cultural-anthropological work of Arnold van Gennep. Together, they provide a framework which enables an archaeological examination of teacher training at the macro-level of the state and its institutions, whilst providing a complementary, genealogical analysis of student teachers at the micro-level of their everyday lives. The investigation found that, in order to transform colonial society into an enlightened rural democracy, the state needed to transform its teachers. It did this through ensuring neophyte teachers passed through a carefully orchestrated rite of passage within a highly centralised and regulated system of training colleges. This necessitated a shift away from the devolved, differentiated pupil-teacher training system. The study traces this move, examines the state?s rationale, and explores the implications for all three phases of the trainees? rite of passage: separation, transition and incorporation. It also explains how specific &#8222;ceremonial rituals? and &#8222;sacred knowledge? prescribed what new teachers should know and do in order to become productive, docile and economically useful members of society. The study also emphasises that student teachers became subjects-in-their-own-making within this regime of order. The study then shifts its focus to the present, &#8222;re-meeting? history by comparing the ritual practices and specialist knowledge of past rites of passage with those of the present. It challenges teacher educators and teachers to take control of teacher education and suggests ways in which they should take advantage of its location in the university by opening up new political spaces and reasserting the importance of professionalism in action.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">teacher training</field><field name="subject">teachers training of</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Divination: Exemplifying and Configuring Archetypes in Ceramics</field><field name="creator">Bye, Joy</field><field name="description">Master of Visual Arts</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archetypes in ceramics</field><field name="subject">tarot divination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSUMING A PARTICIPATION POLICY: CAMBODIAN HEALTH COMMITTEES</field><field name="creator">Gilfillan, Beth</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international aid</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">community management</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">committee</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treating the Emperors in the Qing palace : the tension between the Manchu rulers' public power and private frality.</field><field name="creator">Flowers, Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the medical case records of the Imperial Qing Palace.

Taxonomic theory, where appropriate to this thesis, is discussed. The external morphology of P. gavia and P. huttoni is compared. No single external measurement or plumage character separates more than 60% of birds examined. The best system of identification is to compare the ratio of different body parts within an individual bird. The distribution of P. gavia and P. huttoni is compared. Hutton's shearwater feeds further out to sea and it is believed to be a migrant species wintering in north west Australian waters. The fluttering shearwater is believed to be a semi-migrant species with only the juveniles spending time in south east Australia. The red cell enzymes of P. gavia, P. huttoni and P. griseus are compared. There are differences in two esterase loci between gavia and huttoni, while P. griseus is more distantly related. Nei's genetic identity values are calculated. The systematic value of electrophoretic data is discussed. The relationship of an undescribed subfossil shearwater to P. gavia and P. huttoni is discussed. An outgroup analysis to other shearwater species is carried out according to phylogenetic (cladistic) theory. The subfossil shearwater is most closely related to the fluttering shearwater, and these two form a sister group to Hutton's shearwater. These three species are a sister group of P. opisthomelas. The relationship between the many P. assimilis subspecies, the black-backed Manx shearwaters, and the gavia, huttoni and opisthomelas group was not resolved. Puffinus nativitatis is more closely related to the Manx and the little shearwaters than to the P. griseus, P. tenuirostris group.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Procellariidae</field><field name="subject">Puffinus phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">Puffinus gavia</field><field name="subject">Puffinus huttoni</field><field name="subject">undescribed subfossil shearwater</field><field name="subject">comparative biology</field><field name="subject">comparative osteology</field><field name="subject">red cell enzymes</field><field name="subject">Nei's genetic identities</field><field name="subject">Hutton's shearwater</field><field name="subject">Fluttering shearwater</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270503 Animal anatomy and histology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270706 Life histories (incl. population ecology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A petrographic study of the stratigraphy of Australian coal seams</field><field name="creator">Smyth, Michelle</field><field name="description">Petrographic analyses of over one hundred Australian coal seams of Permian and Triassic age are used to determine within seam and between seam variations and the conditions prevailing during seam formation. Tests on groups of coals show that a change in coal type is dependent on the type of coal immediately preceding (Markovian properties). From this dependence most probable sequences of coal variations can be derived.For individual seams major changes in coal type are represented by characteristic plies, from which standard profiles of each seam are derived. Type seam sequences are derived from the standard profiles for each coal measure group, when more than half of the profiles are similar. Marked similarities exist between the type seam sequences.The distribution of the types of petrographic profiles of all seams is found unlikely to be due to chance. The sequences found from the Markovian properties, the type seam quences and the distribution of profiles are few and similar.All these results indicate that the seams are deposited under ordered conditions and that the major control is an internal one, most probably a response of plant growth and decay to the changing conditions associated with the increase of peat thickness.Comparison with Carboniferous coals from England and Canada shows that similar petrographic profiles are developed in them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The controlled release of neurotrophic proteins from the conducting polymer polypyrrole to improve the nerve/cochlear implant interface</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Brianna</field><field name="description">The cochlear implant has restored hearing to hundreds of thousands of profoundly deaf individuals since the early 1980s. The implant works by providing electrical stimulation directly to the auditory nerves, bypassing the damaged sensory processes. As the electrodes of the cochlear implant are required to directly stimulate the auditory nerves, the interface between these electrodes and the nervous system is a vital part of the function of the bionic device. However, in cases of long-term hearing loss the auditory nerve degenerates and auditory nerve processes, or neurites, retract away from the cochlea and the intra-cochlear electrodes. This leads to a loss of effectiveness cochlear implant. Currently the only remedy for this probleme is to amplify the electrical signals provided to the implant, but this causes shorter battery life due to the higher currents and voltages and can potentially be damaging to the tissues in and surrounding the cochlea. This work describes attempts to develop a material which can be coated onto cochlear electrodes to preserve auditory nerves, potentially improving the interface between the cochlear implant and the auditory nerve.The material used throughout this work, polypyrrole, is a conducting polymer. Due to its unique properties, polypyrrole can be used to incorporate and release charged molecules with different electrical stimuli. The work presented within this thesis  describes the development of polypyrrole to release nerve growth factors, which are also known as neuortrophins, in order to improve auditory nerve survival and growth. With delivery of nerve growth factor in response to the electrical stimuli provided by the cochlear implant, it is hoped that better nerve survival will lead to an improved nerve/cochlear electrode interface, and better function of the implant. Extensive tests on the release of radiolabelled neurotrophins from polypyrrole substrates were performed under a variety of conditions in order to optimise both the material and the electrical stimulation used for controlled release. The focus of most work was neurotrophin-3, the member of the neurotrophin family of proteins that has the most widespread action on cell receptors.Testing of the response of auditory nerve tissue dissected from rats showed that neurotrophins released from polypyrrole promoted the survival and growth of nerves in vitro. From these experiments, it was determined that electrical stimulation was effective in controlling the release of neurotrophins to improve neurite outgrowth to a significant degree. Based on these results in vivo experiments were undertaken, in which guinea pigs were implanted with cochlear electrodes coated with polypyrrole. From these experiments, it was determined that electrical stimulation to promote neurotrophin release helped not only to prevent implantation trauma, but also to prevent deafening-related degeneration of auditory nerves observed in untreated cochleae.Additionally, some further optimisation of the materials was completed. Another neurotrpohin, brain derived neurotrophic factor, has been shown to work synergistically with neurotrophin-3, and the release of both neurotrophins from a single polypyrrole film was investigated. While the release of the proteins was not as well controlled, the effect of release on auditory nerve explants cultured in vitro was significantly greater than either neurotrophin alone. Studies exploring release of neurotrophin-3 from PPy coated on several novel substrates were performed, suggesting that biodegradable and nanostructured materials can be used to further tailor the release of therapeutic proteins from polypyrrole. An implantable power source - a biobattery - was also used to electrically control the release of neurotrophin-3, highlighting the potential for a totally implantable system for the controlled release of therapeutic molecules using the  polypyrrole materials developed.The insights gained in the course of this work may have implications for the controlled  release of other therapeutic molecules from polypyrrole. Additionally, the information contained within this thesis could also have relevance beyond the scope of the cochlear implant/neural interface, with potential for use in other bionic devices or in nerve repair applications. The work described here demonstrates the potential to enhance nerve/ electrode interfaces using polypyrrole to electrically control the release neurotrophins.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of novel nanostructured conducting polypyrrole fibres</field><field name="creator">Foroughi, Javad</field><field name="description">Polypyrrole (PPy) as a conducting polymer has potential applications in electrical and electronic devices because of its high electrical conductivity, environmental stability and redox activity. There have been many attempts to endow electrically PPy with processibility. Although some success has been achieved via synthesising soluble PPy, there have remained difficulties to fabricate this material through fibre spinning due to its low molecular weight and poor mechanical properties. Prior to this thesis, there was no report of the production of PPy fibres. This project therefore aimed to produce novel &#8220;polypyrrole fibres via the development of nanostructured conducting polypyrrole&#8221; by fibre spinning of PPy and to investigate the formed fibres for applications such as actuators, e-textiles, batteries, sensors and biomedical areas. As a result of the research conducted for this thesis, polypyrrole fibres have been produced for the first time. The initial wet-spinning process was enabled by the use of highly soluble non-functionalised PPy using di-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (DEHS) dopant, and the generation of a spinning solution of the PPy-DEHS in dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) solvent. Subsequent work sought to improve the properties of these first generation PPy-DEHS fibres by increasing the molecular weight, addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and addition of a supporting polymer (alginate). The use of the host polymer also enabled a new fibre spinning method to be developed that included an in situ polymerization process. Carbon nanotubes additions were achieved in two ways: firstly by adding small amounts of CNTs to the spinning dope; and secondly, a completely novel approach was developed whereby PPy was polymerized onto and into a CNT yarn. viii Each of the methods used to generate PPy fibres gave different performances in terms of mechanical strength / stiffness; electrical conductivity and electroactivity. Generally, it was found that adding of carbon nanotubes to the PPy improved the strength, stiffness and conductivity. The highest conductivity and Young&#8217;s modulus of any conducting polymer based fibre reported to date was obtained by incorporating PPy into a CNT yarn. The more robust fibres were assessed as mechanical actuators and a maximum strain of 2.5% was produced from the high molecular weight PPy-DEHS fibre. In summary, a range of novel fibrous PPy materials have been developed for possible use in applications such as actuators, sensors, artificial muscles, batteries and biomedical applications. The main aim of the thesis was to develop methods for continuous production of doped PPy fibres. This aim was successfully completed with a variety of different fibre compositions and properties demonstrated using a range of different fibre processing methods. ix</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the critical design parameters for reuse</field><field name="creator">Ibbotson, Scott, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Reuse of components as opposed to material recovery, recycling or disposal has been identified as one of the most efficient EOL strategies for products. The concept behind reuse is that some components and subassemblies have a design life that exceeds the life of the product itself. In order for reuse to be successfully implemented as an EOL strategy, a designer needs to incorporate into a product a philosophy of Design for Reuse (DfRe) at the early design stage. Reliable methods to assess the remaining life of used components based on a products usage life are also required. Furthermore, current industry practices and literature advocate that there is no methodology to decide which parameters need to be redesigned so as to change the life of a selected component to a desired level. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology to assess the reuse potential of product groups based on component failure mechanisms and their associated critical lifetime prediction design parameters. Utilising these clustered groups mathematical models were then developed to establish the useful life of the components for each clustered group. Finally, a means of equating useful life to design life was established and the relationship between, the failure mechanisms, critical lifetime prediction design parameters and design life were represented in graphical format. In order to achieve the proposed objective, Cluster analysis, in particular Group Technology (GT) and Hierarchical clustering were employed to group components with similar failure mechanisms. Following this, multiple linear regression was used to establish mathematical models based on condition monitoring data for each of the clustered groups and their related critical lifetime prediction design parameters. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the mathematical models, in order to produce graphical relations between the useful life and design parameters of a product.  The validity of the suggested methodology was tested on electric motors and a gearbox as both these components have demonstrated great reuse potential. The results demonstrate that the methodology can assist designers in estimating the design life and associated design parameters with great accuracy, and subsequently aiding in a stratagem for reuse.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycled products</field><field name="subject">Spare parts</field><field name="subject">Salvage (Waste, etc.) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc oxide TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) and polycrystalline silicon thin-films for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Song, Dengyuan, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films are very promising for application in photovoltaics. It is extremely challenging to develop cheap TCOs and poly-Si films to make photovoltaic devices. The aim of this thesis is to study sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO TCO and poly-Si films by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) for application in low-cost photovoltaics. The investigated aspects have been (i) to develop and characterize sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films that can be used as a TCO material on crystalline silicon solar cells, (ii) to explore the potential of the developed ZnO:Al films for application in ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, (iii) to make and characterize poly-Si thin-films on different kinds of glass substrates by SPC using electron-beam evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) [referred to as EVA poly-Si material (SPC of evaporated a-Si)], and (iv) to fabricate EVA poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass and improve the energy conversion efficiency of these cells by post-crystallization treatments. The ZnO:Al work in this thesis is focused on the correlation between film characteristics and deposition parameters, such as rf sputter power (Prf), working gas pressure (Pw), and substrate temperature (Tsub), to get a clear picture of film properties in the optimized conditions for application in photovoltaic devices. Especially the laterally non-uniform film properties resulting from the laterally inhomogeneous erosion of the target material are investigated in detail. The influence of Prf, Pw and Tsub on the structural, electrical, optical and surface morphology properties of ZnO:Al films is discussed. It is found that the lateral variations of the parameters of ZnO:Al films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering can be reduced to acceptable levels by optimising the deposition parameters.  ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabricated ZnO:Al films for application in heterojunction solar cells. In this application, expensive indium-tin oxide (ITO) is usually used. Under the standard AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2, 25 ??C), the best fabricated cell shows an open-circuit voltage of 411 mV, a short-circuit current density of 30.0 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 66.7 %, and a conversion efficiency of 8.2 %. This is believed to be the highest stable efficiency ever reported for this type of cell. By means of dark forward current density-voltage-temperature (J-V-T) measurements, it is shown that the dominant current transport mechanism in the ZnO:Al/c-Si solar cells, in the intermediate forward bias voltage region, is trap-assisted multistep tunneling. EVA poly-Si thin-films are prepared on four types of glass substrates (planar and textured glass, both either bare or SiN-coated) based on evaporated Si, which is a cheaper Si deposition method than the existing technologies. The textured glass is realized by the UNSW-developed AIT process (AIT = aluminium-induced texture). The investigation is concentrated on finding optimized process parameters and evaluating film crystallization quality. It is found that EVA poly-Si films have a grain size in the range 0.8-1.5 ??m, and a preferential (111) orientation. UV reflectance and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a high crystalline material quality, both at the air-side surface and in the bulk. EVA cells are fabricated in both substrate and superstrate configuration. Special attention is paid to improving the Voc of the solar cells. For this purpose, after the SPC process, the samples receive the two post-crystallization treatments: (i) a rapid thermal anneal (RTA), and (ii) a plasma hydrogenation. It is found that two post-crystallization treatments more than double the 1-Sun Voc of the substrate-type cells. It is demonstrated that RTA improves the structural material quality of the cells. Furthermore, a hydrogenation step is shown to significantly improve the electronic material quality of the cells. Based on the RTA???d and hydrogenated EVA poly-Si material, the first mesa-type EVA cells are fabricated in substrate configuration, by using sputtered Al-doped ZnO as the transparent front contact. The investigation is focused on addressing the correlation between the type of the substrate and cell performance. Optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the devices are characterized. It is found that the performance  of EVA cells depends on the glass substrate topography. For cells on textured glass, the AIT texture is shown to have a beneficial effect on the optical absorption of EVA films. It is demonstrated that a SiN barrier layer on the AIT-textured glass improves significantly both the crystalline quality of the poly-Si films and the energy conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells. For cells on planar glass, a SiN film between the planar glass and the poly-Si film has no obvious effect on the cell properties. The investigations in this thesis clearly show that EVA poly-Si films are very promising for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">thin films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the evolutionary sequence of massive star formation</field><field name="creator">Hill, Tracey Lee, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Massive stars form in the dense optically thick cores of molecular clouds throughout the Galaxy. They actively participate in the heating of these molecular clouds and also in enriching the interstellar medium with heavy elements. Stellar winds may contribute to change the original cloud structure by in uencing nearby low mass star formation, or even by triggering the formation of new stars. Despite the fact that massive star formation is manifest throughout the Galaxy, the mechanisms involved in their formation are poorly understood. The coincidence of methanol masers and ultracompact (UC) HII regions with young massive stars, indicates their eectiveness in tracing the earliest stages of high-mass stellar evolution. This thesis concentrates on a multiwavelength study of massive star formation regions. The cornerstone of this thesis is a (sub)millimetre study of methanol maser and UC HII sources associated with massive star formation regions. The 15m Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST) and the 15m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) were used to survey continuum emission at 1.2mm and 450 &amp; 850 m, respectively. The 1.2-mm continuum emission observations were undertaken with the SEST IMaging Bolometer Array (SIMBA) toward star-forming complexes associated with methanol maser and/or radio continuum sources. This survey detected emission toward all of the methanol maser and UC HII regions targeted, and revealed evidence of a handful of these tracers lying within the elds mapped without millimetre continuum emission. Interestingly, the SIMBA survey also revealed evidence of sources devoid of traditional star formation tracers (methanol/OH maser, UC HII regions, IRAS sources), detected solely from their millimetre continuum emission. These `mm-only' sources prompted a follow-up study with the JCMT. The 450 and 850m observations  of mm-only cores discovered in the SIMBA survey, utilised the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the JCMT, which detected submillimetre continuum emission toward 97 per cent of sources targeted. The SCUBA instrument also resolved a number of SIMBA sources into multiple components, and found evidence of submillimetre sources devoid of SIMBA emission. The (sub)millimetre data from the SIMBA and SCUBA surveys enabled study of the dust properties of the cores, and in particular the dust grain emissivity index , which is of order 2 for the sample. Spectral energy distribution (SED) diagrams were drawn for the SIMBA sources, employing MSX and IRAS data where possible. Eight parameters are reported for each of the sources in the sample: luminosity, temperature, mass, H2 number density (nH2 ), surface density (), radius, distance and luminosity-tomass ratio (L/M). These data show that the mm-only cores are of comparable mass to sources harbouring a methanol maser and/or radio continuum source, but are smaller, cooler, less luminous, with smaller luminosity-to-mass ratios, than these sources. This prompts the suggestion that the mm-only core is an example of the earliest stages of massive star formation prior to the onset of methanol maser emission. The mm-only sample was identied as comprising two populations, which are distinguished by temperature. The cool-mm sources are distinct from the warm-mm sources as well as from those sources with a methanol maser and/or a radio continuum source for all parameters tested but for the mass and in some instances the radius. The warm-mm on the other hand are similar to those sources with a methanol maser site and/or an UC HII region for all parameters tested. The cool-mm sources are less luminous, with lower luminosity-to-mass ratios, as well as higher H2 number and surface densities. This prompts hypotheses to be drawn regarding the nature of these two mm-only populations. The warm-mm sources are possible precursors to the methanol maser and are thus indicative of the earliest stages of massive star formation, whilst the cool-mm sources are possible examples of `failed' cores that will remain starless. It is, however, not yet clear which of these mm-only populations are forming massive stars and further work to test these hypotheses is required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering polishness: articulating and maintaining identity through turbulent times</field><field name="creator">Drozdzewski, Danielle, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis details the maintenance of Polish identities through acts of memory: the  (re)production, transmission and reception of Polish cultural practices.  The                 (re)productions and transmissions of Polish identity formations, and the acts of remembrance, are multifarious by nature, and I have examined them in two distinctly different settings ?? in public spheres in Poland, and in the private realms of Australian Polish diaspora.  In this thesis, these research settings have been conceptualised as the conduits through which Polish identities are maintained.  Polish identity is theorised using a constructivist approach; Polish identities are therefore positioned historically and geographically.  Their performances are fluid: they move through time and across spaces.  The active maintenance of Polish identity developed as a result of foreign occupations.  The partitioning of Poland by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires lasted 123 years.  From 1795 to 1918 the Polish nation was expunged.  Following a brief period of independence between World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII), Poland was again occupied by Nazi and Soviet regimes during WWII (1939-1945).  The Soviet occupation continued after WWII with the Soviet-supported Polish government that lasted until 1989.  Under occupation ?? particularly during WWII ?? Poland suffered events that have been indelibly imprinted within Polish cultural memory.  The macabre nature of this era included the incursion of hegemonic regimes on political and everyday social life, as well as the atrocities for which it is well known.  An important outcome of these occupations has been the division of discourses of Polishness, and their remembrances, into distinctly public and private spheres.  These periods of foreign occupation brought various attempts to suppress and eliminate Polishness: the cultures and identifications of Polish people.  Suppression particularly occurred in public spheres through the prohibition of the Polish language, and by investing the public memory landscape with ideologies that represented the new regimes.  By repressing public commemorations of Polish cultural narratives, a new history was written at the expense of the Polish experience.  There have been two primary responses to these repressions of Polishness.  These responses initially developed during the partitioned period to ensure that Polish language and cultural practices were maintained.  First, a narrative and tradition of resistance emerged in reaction to the Russian, Prussian and Austrian partitions.  It was enacted through military participation in insurrections and through the production of patriotic Romantic Era cultural artefacts, both of which strengthened linkages to the Polish Catholic faith.  Second, Polish cultural practices and language were safeguarded in the private spheres of home.  It was in private settings, in Poland and within the diaspora in Australia, that memories and experiences of occupation were passed on and through generations.  In Poland, such narratives were often maintained in resistance to those imposed by foreign occupiers and because of the inability to commemorate events of Poland??s macabre past in public.  In Australia, identity maintenance has occurred to resist the dissolution of Polishness in a diasporic and multicultural environment.  This thesis demonstrates the utility of studying cultural memories as a means of understanding how identity maintenance can occur in the face of adversities, such as the multiple foreign occupations that occurred in Poland, and in diaspora.  Moreover, it exemplifies the diverse paths of identity maintenance in different contexts.  This thesis shows that despite the distinctive character of both Polish public and private spheres, Polish identities have been informed, shaped and maintained through culturally-enacted memory (re)production.  This process is exhibited in the present ?? in Poland and through the diaspora ?? and it occurred despite the repressive aims of various foreign occupiers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polishness</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Polish -- Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of arterial stiffness by angiotensin receptors and nitric oxide in the insulin resistance syndrome</field><field name="creator">Brillante, Divina Graciela, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin resistance syndrome [INSR] is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and affects up to 25% of the Australian population. The mechanism underlying the relationship between the INSR and increased cardiovascular risk is controversial. We postulated that perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system [RAS] and endothelium-derived NO may be implicated in the development of early vascular changes in the INSR.  Repeated measurements of arterial stiffness [using digital photoplethysmography] and haemodynamic parameters in response to vasoactive medications were used to demonstrate the functional expression of angiotensin II [Ang II] receptors and NO synthase [NOS].  Ang II acts via two main receptor sub-types: the Ang II type 1 [AT1] and Ang II type 2 [AT2] receptors. The AT1 receptor is central to the development of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. The role of AT2 receptors in humans is controversial but is postulated to counter-act AT1 receptor mediated effects in diseased vascular beds. We demonstrated increased AT1 and AT2 receptor-mediated effects in small to medium-sized arteries of subjects with early INSR [Chapter 6].  In addition, functional expression of AT2 receptors in adult insulin resistant humans [Chapter 5], but not in healthy volunteers [Chapter 4] was demonstrated. AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with early INSR resulted in improvements in vascular function, with a consequent functional down-regulation of AT2 receptors [Chapter 7].  Functional NOS expression was demonstrated to be increased in subjects with early INSR compared with healthy controls [Chapter 6]. This was postulated to be a homeostatic response to counteract early vascular changes in subjects with early INSR. AT1 receptor blockade in these subjects reduced functional NOS expression [Chapter 8].  In conclusion, patients with early INSR represent a model of early disease where early intervention may be able to reverse the process incited by the initial exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Early vascular changes in these individuals are mediated at least in part, by increased AT1 receptor activity and/or expression, and may be detected by changes in arterial stiffness indices and non-invasive vascular reactivity studies. There is a compensatory increase in AT2 receptor and NOS expression/activity to counter-act these vascular changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial stiffness.</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Angiotensin receptors.</field><field name="subject">AT1 receptor.</field><field name="subject">AT2 receptor.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Document management and retrieval for specialised domains: an evolutionary user-based approach</field><field name="creator">Kim, Mihye, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Browsing marked-up documents by traversing hyperlinks has become probably the most important means by which documents are accessed, both via the World Wide Web (WWW) and organisational Intranets. However, there is a pressing demand for document management and retrieval systems to deal appropriately with the massive number of documents available. There are two classes of solution: general search engines, whether for the WWW or an Intranet, which make little use of specific domain knowledge or hand-crafted specialised systems which are costly to build and maintain. The aim of this thesis was to develop a document management and retrieval system suitable for small communities as well as individuals in specialised domains on the Web. The aim was to allow users to easily create and maintain their own organisation of documents while ensuring continual improvement in the retrieval performance of the system as it evolves. The system developed is based on the free annotation of documents by users and is browsed using the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). A number of annotation support tools were developed to aid the annotation process so that a suitable system evolved. Experiments were conducted in using the system to assist in finding staff and student home pages at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales. Results indicated that the annotation tools provided a good level of assistance so that documents were easily organised and a lattice-based browsing structure that evolves in an ad hoc fashion provided good efficiency in retrieval performance. An interesting result suggested that although an established external taxonomy can be useful in proposing annotation terms, users appear to be very selective in their use of terms proposed. Results also supported the hypothesis that the concept lattice of FCA helped take users beyond a narrow search to find other useful documents. In general, lattice-based browsing was considered as a more helpful method than Boolean queries or hierarchical browsing for searching a specialised domain. We conclude that the concept lattice of Formal Concept Analysis, supported by annotation techniques is a useful way of supporting the flexible open management of documents required by individuals, small communities and in specialised domains. It seems likely that this approach can be readily integrated with other developments such as further improvements in search engines and the use of semantically marked-up documents, and provide a unique advantage in supporting autonomous management of documents by individuals and groups - in a way that is closely aligned with the autonomy of the WWW.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Database management</field><field name="subject">Lattice theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the demagnetisation process and possible alternative magnetic treatments for naval vessels</field><field name="creator">Baynes, Timothy Malcolm, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naval submarines and surface ships are regularly subjected to a treatment called &amp;quotdeperming&amp;quot that seeks to design the vessel???s permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate various aspects of the deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A &amp;quotlaboratory MTF&amp;quot was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU200T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ??5%) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU200T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ??0.1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0.94 ??0.09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA2S-E and CU200T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU200T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5.97??10-3 and 0.0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D): redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel &amp;quotanhysteretic deperm&amp;quot method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin???s equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. &amp;quotSympathetic deperming&amp;quot occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (&amp;gt 0.1m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0.5mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Degaussing</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic devices</field><field name="subject">Magnetism of ships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of incentives, uncertainty and transaction costs on the efficiency of public sector outsourcing contracts</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Paul H., Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the late 1970s, the world has experienced a wave of microeconomic reform that has resulted in the privatisation of many previously State-owned assets, as well as other reforms directed at improving the efficiency of government business enterprises. This dissertation focuses on one important instrument of reform: outsourcing of public-sector service provision. Despite the prevalence of outsourcing, there has been relatively little empirical work analysing the effects of outsourcing at the contract level. This dissertation addresses three important empirical issues related to outsourcing. First, analysis of the magnitude and sources of cost savings associated with outsourcing was undertaken using a present value costing framework. Unlike other studies, this study includes transaction costs and considers how costs change over the life of the contract. The results indicate that savings of 37 per cent were achieved in the first year of contract operation ?savings that were achieved through a combination of reductions in pay and conditions, labour-saving technological change and reductions in inefficiency. Secondly, the dissertation considered why the level of savings achieved fell to 24 per cent following contract variations at the end of year 1. Some evidence indicated that this may have been due to opportunistic behaviour or hold-up: that the contract service provider may have taken advantage of contractual incompleteness and increased its price during the course of contract renegotiations. Although hold-up is an important theme in the literature on contracts, little empirical work has been undertaken in verifying its existence. Thirdly, the impact of contract design on the efficiency of outsourcing arrangements was analysed. It is well known that contract theory predicts a trade-off between incentives and risk. Using the standard principal-agent framework, a simple model is developed to analyse the effects of demand uncertainty on the risk-incentive trade-off. This model is then tested using data from maintenance services contracts at two corporatised water retailers in Melbourne: an environment that is characterised by high levels of both cost and demand uncertainty. Using a general linear regression model, the results obtained indicate that the moral hazard effect dominated the risk premium effect.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Public onctracts--Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Contracting out--Government policy--Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Transaction costs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Savings and recovery after extinction of a classically conditioned response in the rabbit</field><field name="creator">Weidemann, Gabrielle, School Of Psychology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis examined post-extinction recovery phenomena following classical conditioning in the rabbit. The first series of experiments examined the rate of reacquisition to the original conditioned stimulus (CS) and to a cross-modal CS following various amounts of extinction. In both the rabbit nictitating membrane (NM) preparation and rabbit heart rate (HR) conditioning, there was a graded reduction in the rate of reacquisition as a direct function of the number of extinction trials. In the rabbit NM preparation, there was also a graded reduction in the rate of acquisition to a cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light). However, concurrent recovery of responding to the original, extinguished stimulus (CSA, e.g., tone) during training with a novel, cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light), appeared uniformly robust even following extensive extinction. The second series of experiments examined the conditions necessary for concurrent recovery to occur in the rabbit NM preparation. The introduction of CSB-US pairings resulted in strong recovery of responding to CSA, while the reintroduction of the US alone failed to result in any discernable reinstatement of responding to CSA. Concurrent recovery was specific to the trained and extinguished CSA, with virtually no generalized responding to a novel cross-modal test stimulus (CSC). However, pretraining with CSB-US pairings significantly reduced the amount of recovery to CSA during subsequent CSB???US pairings. The third series of experiments revealed that concurrent recovery was specific to the extinguished stimulus (CSA) with only moderate generalization to other familiar but untrained stimuli in the same modality as CSA. Together these results indicate that concurrent recovery is not primarily the result of the unmasking of the original CSA-US association. Rather, concurrent recovery appears to be at least partially the result of learning-dependent generalization. However, in order for responding to CSB, to generalize to CSA, CSA must have been paired with the same US which is subsequently paired with CSB. Thus, the CSA-US association must be partially intact for concurrent recovery to occur. A layered network model with multiple hidden units is able to simulate rapid reacquisition, facilitated cross-modal acquisition and concurrent recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conditioned response</field><field name="subject">Classical conditioning</field><field name="subject">Rabbits</field><field name="subject">Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and programming embedded controllers with timed automata and synchronous languages</field><field name="creator">Bourke , Timothy Peter, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Embedded controllers coordinate the behaviours of specialised hardware components to satisfy broader application requirements. They are difficult to model and to program. One of the greatest challenges is to express intricate timing behaviours???which arise from the physical characteristics of components???while not precluding efficient implementations on resource-constrained platforms. Aspects of this challenge are addressed by this thesis through four distinct applications of timed automata and the synchronous languages Argos and Esterel. A novel framework for simulating controllers written in an imperative synchronous language is described. It includes a transformation of synchronous models into timed automata that accounts for timing properties which are important in constrained implementations but ignored by the usual assumption of synchrony. The transformation provides an interface between the discrete time of synchronous programs and a continuous model of time. This interface is extended to provide a way for simulating Argos programs within the widely-used Simulink software. Timed automata are well-suited for semantic descriptions, like the aforementioned transformation, and for modelling abstract algorithms and protocols. This thesis also includes a different type of case study. The timing diagram of a small-scale embedded component is modelled in more detail than usual with the aim of studying timing properties in this type of system. Multiple models are constructed, including one of an assembly language controller. Their interrelations are verified in Uppaal using a construction for timed trace inclusion testing. Existing constructions for testing timed trace inclusion do not directly address recent features of the Uppaal modelling language. Novel solutions for the problems presented by selection bindings, quantifiers, and channel arrays in Uppaal are presented in this thesis. The first known implementation of a tool for automatically generating a timed trace inclusion construction is described. The timed automata case study demonstrates one way of implementing application timing behaviours while respecting implementation constraints. A more challenging, but less detailed, example is proposed to evaluate the adequacy of Esterel for such tasks. Since none of the standard techniques are completely adequate, a novel alternative for expressing delays in physical time is proposed. Programs in standard Esterel are recovered through syntactic transformations that account for platform constraints.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Argos</field><field name="subject">Timed automata</field><field name="subject">Synchronous languages</field><field name="subject">Esterel</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Real-time</field><field name="subject">Simulink</field><field name="subject">Stateflow</field><field name="subject">Timing diagrams</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operating system directed power management</field><field name="creator">Snowdon, David, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Energy is a critical resource in all types of computing systems from servers, where energy costs dominate data centre expenses and carbon footprints, to embedded systems, where the system's battery life limits the device's functionality. In their efforts to reduce the energy use of these system's hardware manufacturers have implemented features which allow a reduced energy consumption under software control. This thesis shows that managing these settings is a more complex problem than previously considered. Where much (but not all) of the previous academic research investigates unrealistic scenarios, this thesis presents a solution to managing the power on varying hardware. Instead of making unrealistic assumptions, we extract a model from empirical data and characterise that model. Our models estimate the effect of different power management settings on the behaviour of the hardware platform, taking into account the workload, platform and environmental characteristics, but without any kind of a-priori knowledge of the specific workloads being run. These models encapsulate a system's knowledge of the platform. We also developed a \emph{generalised energy-delay} policy which allows us to quickly express the instantaneous importance of both performance and energy to the system. It allows us to select a power management strategy from a number of options. This thesis shows, by evaluation on a number of platforms, that our implementation, Koala, can accurately meet energy and performance goals. In some cases, our system saves 26\% of the system-level energy required for a task, while losing only 1\% performance. This is nearly 46\% of the dynamic energy.  Taking advantage of all energy-saving opportunities requires detailed platform, workload and environmental information. Given this knowledge, we reach the exciting conclusion that near optimal power management is possible on real operating systems, with real platforms and real workloads.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operating Systems</field><field name="subject">Power Management</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Voltage Scaling</field><field name="subject">Energy</field><field name="subject">Efficiency</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of controlling shareholder identity on firm performance and corporate policies: a study of corporate control transfers in an international context</field><field name="creator">Deng, Hua, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the identity of new controlling shareholders in partial corporate control transactions and its influence on firm performance and corporate policies in an international context. In a transfer of partial corporate control, the identity of controlling shareholder changs, thereby facilitating an event study of corporate changes resulted from controlling shareholder turnover. The dissertation comprises of three empirical research projects to address two questions: Firstly, does the identity of a new controlling shareholder in a partial control transfer matter to firm value? Secondly, how does new controlling shareholder identity explain the differences of firm performance and corporate policies in the long run? The equity block transactions in listed firms from around the world announced between 1996 and 2005 are filtered to arrive at the final sample of 215 corporate control transfers through private negotiation. This hand-collected dataset allows the dissertation to contribute to the existing literature on ownership concentration by introducing the identity of controlling shareholder into the theoretical framework and investigating its significance in an international context.  It is argued that firm value, long-term performance and corporate policies can be influenced by the identity of new controlling shareholders because different controlling shareholders have distinct incentives, skills and styles. This dissertation finds that individual investor controlled firms outperform those controlled by corporate investors in both short-term abnormal returns and long-term performance after a control transfer; and that the sample firms controlled by individual and corporate investors adopt different policies of investment and financial leverage. The evidence presented here shows that individual controlling shareholders are better motivated to monitor managers and improve operational efficiency. Partial corporate control activities have important governance effects and controlling shareholder heterogeneity is a significant contributing factor to firm performance and decision making.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Firm performance</field><field name="subject">Controlling shareholder identity</field><field name="subject">Corporate control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compiler techniques for thread-level speculation</field><field name="creator">Gao, Lin , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dual-core, quad-core and many-core processors are replacing the traditional single-core processors. To take advantage of these multicore processors, traditional sequential applications need to be parallelised. However, the compiler often fails to find enough thread-level parallelism from sequential applications, especially from general-purpose applications with the extensive use of pointers, indirectly-indexed structures, or complex control flows. The major challenge lies in identifying dependences in sequential applications so that independent threads can be extracted from the applications. Thread-level speculation (TLS) is a promising solution to address this problem. It allows the compiler to extract parallel threads from a sequential application without having to prove that they are independent.  This dissertation investigates the compiler techniques for TLS. We propose three compiler techniques on parallelising loops and recursive procedures: Loop Recreation Transformation (LRT), Thread-sensitive Modulo Scheduling (TMS), and Speculative Parallelisation of Recursive Procedures (SPRP). LRT restructures a loop into a prologue, a kernel loop and an epilogue so that the new kernel loop can achieve higher thread-level parallelism than the original loop on TLS systems. TMS generalises traditional modulo scheduling to exploit both thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism in a loop. SPRP exploits thread-level parallelism in recursive procedures, especially the recursive procedures whose invocation orders might change at runtime. SPRP uses a helper thread running on one core to predict the invocation order of recursive procedures dynamically. Thus, SPRP is capable of effectively parallelising recursive procedures that are otherwise difficult to be parallelised by existing TLS techniques. We also propose a Statically Greedy and Dynamically Adaptive (SEED) approach to parallelise multi-level loops. It is necessary to use out-of-order thread spawning when parallelising multi-level loops. Therefore, a new thread scheduling policy is proposed in SEED to couple with the out-of-order thread spawning strategy. SEED allows the compiler to greedily select the set of loops to be parallelised and relies on a runtime scheduler to maximise the performance adaptively.  All the compiler techniques and approaches proposed in this dissertation have been implemented on top of either the MachSUIF or the GCC compilation framework. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation of these techniques and their implementations using a realistic simulation platform.

Chapter 1 describes how brain reserve has come to be viewed in two distinct ways: differential expression of brain injury on the basis of individual differences in gross brain properties (neurological), or on the basis of lifespan patterns of complex mental activity (behavioural). Evidence in the Alzheimer???s disease and ageing literature has been extensive, yet with conflicting reports. In order to better evaluate this evidence, a systematic review of cohort studies is the focus of Chapter 2. Complex mental activity was found to be associated with reduced incidence of dementia and slowed rate of cognitive decline. Neurological brain reserve evidence was limited. A major task of this dissertation was to develop a more standard and complete behavioural brain reserve instrument. Chapter 3 relates the development of the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) in a group of 86 healthy elderly. The LEQ had adequate levels of internal consistency and reliability. In a validation test, higher LEQ scores were also found to predict attenuated cognitive decline over 18 months independent of covariates including premorbid IQ. Chapter 4 describes how both LEQ (as a measure of behavioural brain reserve) and intracranial volume (as a measure of neurological brain reserve) significantly predicted cognitive decline over three years in a sample of 70 aged subjects. Total LEQ was furthermore significantly correlated with hippocampal volume independent of intracranial volume, and this association mediated the relationship with cognitive decline. Behavioural brain reserve may therefore work by protecting individuals from hippocampal atrophy. The fifth chapter explores therapeutic and neurobiological aspects of behavioural brain reserve in a preliminary fashion. A randomized-control mental activity trial was run with 20 healthy elderly who received repeat magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mental activity subjects were found to have selective and sustained upregulation of phosphocreatine metabolism in the hippocampal region, a finding of potential neuroprotective significance. Experience-dependent neuroplasticity is proposed as a unifying framework in the final chapter, allowing synthesis of the present findings and reconciliation of the neurological and behavioural approaches to brain reserve.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">brain imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware implementation of V-BLAST MIMO</field><field name="creator">Sobhanmanesh, Fariborz, School of Electrical Engineering And Telecommunications, UNSW</field><field name="description">The exploitation of the theoretically enormous capacity achieved by the multiple transmit and receive antennas systems (MIMO) in a rich scattering communication channel has been the subject of vast body of research on the field of MIMO. In particular, the Vertically-layered Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) is a well known MIMO architecture which has demonstrated the enormous capacity of 20-40 bit/s/Hz in an indoor propagation environment with realistic SNR and error rates. However, due to the intensive computation involved, it would be difficult to implement this architecture for high data rate communication systems. Some works have been done to improve the receiver complexity and performance by coding techniques, by different detection architectures. In this thesis, we have focused on QR-based decoders for V-BLAST MIMO. For a suitable V-BLAST detection implementation, we need to carefully consider the problem from algorithmic, arithmetic and architectural aspects. At the algorithmic level, the numerical stability and robustness should be considered. At the arithmetic level, signal quantization is important, and, at the architectural level, parallelism and pipelining require attention. We have performed the above mentioned optimization on the 1-pass QR factorization with back substitution SIC (Symbol Interference Cancellation) decoder in chapter 3. At first optimizations are made on the proposed algorithm and architecture using MATLAB simulations. Then a new architecture for the QR-factorizer as the core processor of the V-BLAST decoder is developed in chapter 4. This architecture uses only two low complexity CORDIC (Coordinate rotation digital computer) processors.  The parameterized feature of the controller and address generator blocks of this architecture has provided a scalable architecture for the implementation of QR factorization for square matrix of any dimension. The reduced hardware complexity of the processors and its simple parameterized controller are two outstanding features of the architecture, resulting in a more suitable alternative architecture for QR factorization than traditional triangular systolic arrays. In the next phase of the research, new hardware architectures of the back substitution SIC decoder was developed for a 4 X 4 MIMO system with 16-QAM constellation scheme in chapter 5. The division operation for back substitution needs a complex hardware, and results in the numerical instability. In the proposed hardware the elimination of division and modification of multiplier has reduced the hardware complexity and led to numerical stability. In addition the pre decoding block was designed and optimized in terms of number of the pipeline registers and CORDIC rotator processors. The developed hardware is capable of processing 20 vectors data burst and results in a throughput of 149 Mb/s. The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and ASIC (Application specific Integrated Circuit) implementations of the proposed optimized architecture are presented in Chapter 5. We found that the equivalent gates and the core area in our design is less than 30% of other designs and the maximum clock frequency and the throughput is higher (175 %) than other works. Finally the improvements of the BER performance using the branching method and parallel architectures are presented in chapter 6. In this supplementary part to back substitution OSIC decoder, the final symbol vector is selected from 2 or 8 potential candidates based on the minimum Euclidean norm, which improves the BER between 3 to 7 db and gives a very close match to the original V-BLAST performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO systems</field><field name="subject">Space time codes</field><field name="subject">Antenna arrays</field><field name="subject">Signal processing - digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of instruction memory for embedded systems</field><field name="creator">Janapsatya, Andhi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents methodologies for improving system performance and energy consumption by optimizing the memory hierarchy performance. The processor-memory performance gap is a well-known problem that is predicted to get worse, as the performance gap between processor and memory is widening. The author describes a method to estimate the best L1 cache configuration for a given application. In addition, three methods are presented to improve the performance and reduce energy in embedded systems by optimizing the instruction memory. Performance estimation is an important procedure to assess the performance of the system and to assess the effectiveness of any applied optimizations. A cache memory performance estimation methodology is presented in this thesis. The methodology is designed to quickly and accurately estimate the performance of multiple cache memory configurations. Experimental results showed that the methodology is on average 45 times faster compared to a widely used tool (Dinero IV). The first optimization method is a software-only method, called code placement, was implemented to improve the performance of instruction cache memory. The method involves careful placement of code within memory to ensure high cache hit rate when code is brought into the cache memory. Code placement methodology aims to improve cache hit rates to improve cache memory performance. Experimental results show that by applying the code placement method, a reduction in cache miss rate by up to 71%, and energy consumption reduction of up to 63% are observed when compared to application without code placement. The second method involves a novel architecture for utilizing scratchpad memory. The scratchpad memory is designed as a replacement of the instruction cache memory. Hardware modification was designed to allow data to be written into the scratchpad memory during program execution, allowing dynamic control of the scratchpad memory content. Scratchpad memory has a faster memory access time and a lower energy consumption per access compared to cache memory; the usage of scratchpad memory aims to improve performance and lower energy consumption of systems compared to system with cache memory. Experimental results show an average energy reduction of 26.59% and an average performance improvement of 25.63% when compared to a system with cache memory. The third is an application profiling method using statistical information to identify application???s hot-spots. Application profiling is important for identifying section in the application where performance degradation might occur and/or where maximum performance gain can be obtained through optimization. The method was applied and tested on the scratchpad based system described in this thesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the analysis method in reducing energy and improving performance when compared to previous method for utilizing the scratchpad memory based system (average performance improvement of 23.6% and average energy reduction of 27.1% are observed).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Cache memory</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Situated learning and polycontextual boundary crossing: Practitioners' perceptions of the transfer of competence across different work contexts</field><field name="creator">Down, Catherine Mary</field><field name="description">This research focused on the question, How do practitioners understand the transfer of competence (that is, what do they know and can do) accross different workplace contexts and how does it influence their practice? The research investigates the experiences and perceptions of 108 workers, who have changed jobs or whose jobs have changed, as to how they were able to adapt what they knew and could do at the time. The research is phenomological, using a methodology designed to collect and analyse data from the participants without decontextualising it. The methodology is customised and contextualised  and uses activity theory, Engestrom's theory of expansive learning, grounded theory and discourse analysis to interrogate the research question. The collection of data occurred over a period of five years and was in two stages, with the second stage validating and building on the first stage. Minimally structured interviews and a questionnare were the main data collec tion tools used. Some descriptive statistics have been used but the research is qualitative in intent. The research draws on current theoretical positions of learning, transfer, experimental learning, workplace learning, activity theory, qualitative research and reflection on experience. The thesis has been written to foreground the voices of the participants and the insights their experience brings to the research. The research addresses a current gap in research work, carried out in Australia or overseas, which focuses on the transfer of competence across workplaces. The outcomes provide new perspectives on the ways in which practitioners understand transfer and integrate these interpretations into their generalisation without decontextualisation, and thus makes a contribution to our collective knowledge and understanding. The outcomes of the research are a metaphoric framework to guide the transfer of competence over different work contexts; a record of the application of new understandings of transfer as  a sequence of consequential transitions (Beach 1999); generalisations derived from the embedding of contexts (Van Oers 1998); and an innovative research methodology. In addition, the participants have provided their perspectives on the preperation of, and on-going support for, people entering or crossing workplace contexts, and the consequential, necessary changes to institutional learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">workplace change</field><field name="subject">transfer</field><field name="subject">contextual learning</field><field name="subject">activity theory</field><field name="subject">practitioner perspectives</field><field name="subject">competence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060911.130320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Genetic Algorithm to a Forced Landing Manoeuvre on Transfer of Training Analysis</field><field name="creator">Tong, Peter</field><field name="description">This study raises some issues for training pilots to fly forced landings and examines the impact that these issues may have on the design of simulators for such training.  It focuses on flight trajectories that a pilot of a single-engine general aviation aircraft should fly after engine failure and how pilots can be better simulator trained for this forced landing manoeuvre.  A sensitivity study on the effects of errors and an investigation on the effect of tolerances in the aerodynamic parameters as prescribed in the Manual of Criteria for the Qualification of Flight Simulators have on the performance of flight simulators used for pilot training was carried out.  It uses a simplified analytical model for the Beech Bonanza model E33A aircraft and a vertical atmospheric turbulence based on the MIL-F-8785C specifications.  It was found that the effect of the tolerances is highly sensitive on the nature of the manoeuvre flown and that in some cases, negative transfe r of training may be induced by the tolerances.      A forced landing trajectory optimisation was carried out using Genetic Algorithm.  The forced landing manoeuvre analyses with pre-selected touchdown locations and pre-selected final headings were carried out for an engine failure at 650 ft AGL for bank angles varying from banking left at 45&#176; to banking right at 45&#176;, and with an aircraft's speed varying from 75.6 mph to 208 mph, corresponding to 5% above airplane's stall speed and airplane's maximum speed respectively.  The results show that certain pre-selected touchdown locations are more susceptible to horizontal wind.  The results for the forced landing manoeuvre with a pre-selected location show minimal distance error while the quality of the results for the forced landing manoeuvre with a pre-selected location and a final heading show that the results depend on the end constraints.  For certain pre-selected touchdown locations and final headings, the airplane may either touchdown very close to the pre-selected touchdown location but with greater final h eading error from the pre-selected final heading or touchdown with minimal final heading error from the pre-selected final heading but further away from the pre-selected touchdown location.      Analyses for an obstacle avoidance forced landing manoeuvre were also carried out where an obstacle was intentionally placed in the flight path as found by the GA program developed for without obstacle.  The methodology developed successfully found flight paths that will avoid the obstacle and touchdown near the pre-selected location.  In some cases, there exist more than one ensemble grouping of flight paths.  The distance error depends on both the pre-selected touchdown location and where the obstacle was placed.  The distance error tends to increase with the addition of a specific final heading requirement for an obstacle avoidance forced landing manoeuvre.  As with the case without specific final heading requirement, there is a trade off between touching down nearer to the pre-selected location and touching down with a smaller final heading error.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flight simulator</field><field name="subject">Forced Landing</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithm</field><field name="subject">Obstacle Avoidance</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity Analysis</field><field name="subject">Sequential Quadratic Programming</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080528.114140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fairness in downsizing : judgement and complexity</field><field name="creator">Baker, David</field><field name="description">People make all sorts of judgements of their life experiences.

It was conceived as a gift to the people of Australia and now stands on Acton Peninsula in Canberra, the nation's Capital. It is a visually complex manifestation of the design architects' (ARM) dialogue with the ambiguities of Australian history and national identity. The architectural realisation of these complexities was facilitated through advances in computer technologies and a complementary non-traditional procurement method, both at the leading edge of Australian architectural practice of the time. Completed three years earlier was probably the most debated work of architecture of the 1990s, the Guggenheim Museum (GMB) (1991-98) in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank O. Gehry and Associates (FOG&amp;A). This satellite museum of the Guggenheim Foundation of New York was heralded as the quintessential example of a kind of architecture only possible because of advances in computer technologies. Both visually complex museums were conceived as flagship projects and consequently share many political, functional, and cultural expectations. Both were procured outside the usual adversarial designer/builder paradigm of western architecture and featured the innovative use of three-dimensional (CAD) software for design, documentation and analysis. The NMA project used a government instigated procurement method which was embraced by a group of design and construction companies who formed a joint venture known as the Acton Peninsula Alliance. This non-traditional or relationship-based procurement method required ARM to reassess their approach to generate and disseminate design data and their traditional relationship with other design and construction professionals. As part of this process, ARM were required to devolve some of their design authority to a project delivery team via a Design Integrity Panel and an Independent Quality Panel; both innovations integral to the Acton Peninsula Alliance. The NMA project reframed many of the enduring professional relationships of Australian architecture and in so doing extended the skill set and expectations of the architects and others to include a more substantial engagement with 3D CAD and a procurement system which was less subject to many of the common impediments inherent in the more traditional processes. Through a series of interviews with the architects and other stakeholders, a qualitative methodology was used to investigate the NMA as a case study which uses the GMB as an internationally recognised comparison. This thesis examines how these two projects have been successfully completed within time and budgetary constraints in an environment where flagship projects have had a history of highly publicised difficulties. It reveals that the successful realisation of the NMA was due to the relationships built or reframed as a result of this cooperative approach in conjunction with high levels of engagement with computer technologies. This is in contrast to the seamless flow of data and high levels of prefabrication integral to the success of the GMB.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture, public architecture, computer-aided design, construction industry, industrial procurement, National Museum of Australia</field><field name="subject">National Museum of Australia Planning.</field><field name="subject">Architecture Australia Designs and plans.</field><field name="subject">Computer-aided design Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Museums Australian Capital Territory Canberra Planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation of an integrated approach to sustainable water management in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Vo, Phu Le</field><field name="description">In 1986, Vietnam opened up the country&#8217;s economy by launching the Doi Moi (renovation) policy, which made the process of economic liberalisation possible. Accordingly, Ho Chi Minh City, the country&#8217;s biggest city, has undergone rapid growth of population, urbanisation and industrialisation. While achieving remarkable economic growth, the city faces considerable urban environmental challenges. The rapid growth of urbanisation and industry has placed increasing pressure on available freshwater resources, through excessive water use and increasing volumes of untreated wastewater. Firstly, the urban water sector has had to meet growing demand for water use for domestic purposes during the dry season. Secondly, groundwater levels have experienced a substantial drawdown in outlying urban districts as a result of over-abstraction. Thirdly, rapidly expanding industrial activities are causing severe demand on water resources. The city&#8217;s major supply sources have developed an alarming level of pollutants discharged by industry.  The aim of this thesis is to formulate an integrated approach to the sustainable management of water resources in Ho Chi Minh City. In order to achieve this, the research was designed to examine institutional frameworks and arrangements and to explore the perception of water value by water users and stakeholders. The underlying reasons for ineffective management are anchored in fragmented management practices which result from inadequate institutional frameworks and arrangements, inadequate regulations and inappropriate water governance. Weak enforcement of law and insufficient cooperation between government agencies and departments in Ho Chi Minh City and their counterparts in neighbouring provinces also limit management efficacy.  The research results show that stakeholders have different perceptions of water resources. Overall, water value has been considered as a social and economic good by both the urban respondents and government officials. However, most urban residents view water as a social good rather than an economic one. Public involvement in the water sector is limited. Most urban dwellers have little understanding and knowledge about the city&#8217;s water issues or the available channels to access information on water resources.  Many government officials are inadequately trained, poorly qualified, inexperienced and have irrelevant or outdated background knowledge about their field of management. Government respondents did not provide consistent data and information on the water profile because there is no shared common information on water issues in place. Findings from the fieldwork show that decentralisation, privatisation and using rainwater as a potential alternative water source are preferred.  Finally, the study proposes a schematic revision of existing management structures and mechanisms between local government agencies. This thesis proposes a model for a water conservation strategy for which the management and use of water resources is aligned with adequate institutional arrangements and effective regulations. Water governance and management of water resources need to work with economic and urbanisation growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formulation; Integrated approach; Water management; Ho Chi Minh City; Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reasons, capacities and the motivational requirement.</field><field name="creator">Lowry, Rosemary</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses theories of practical reason. In particular I compare desire theories of reasons with value theories of reasons. Desire theories of reasons, as I define them, claim that it is a necessary condition of A having a reason to &#1092; that A&#8217;s reason depend on A&#8217;s antecedent desires. In contrast, I define value theories of reasons as those theories that claim that it is a necessary condition of A having a reason to &#1092; that A&#8217;s &#1092;-ing be valuable. In this thesis my main concern lies with those value theorists who accept the motivational requirement: the claim that if an agent is to have a reason to &#1092;, then it must be possible for the agent to &#1092; on the basis of this reason. In particular, I concentrate on those value theorists who claim that A has a reason to &#1092; iff a) A&#8217;s &#1092;-ing is valuable; b) it is possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason. I reject desire theories of reasons on the basis of several criticisms. I claim that our desires are normatively arbitrary, and that according to desire theories of reasons, some of our desires ought to be eradicated. I argue instead for a value theory of reasons that adopts a particular interpretation of the motivational requirement. I distinguish three different interpretations of the motivational requirement, each offering a connection between reasons and motivations that differs in strength. The first, strongest requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to &#1092;, it must be possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason given certain qualities that A possesses (where I take the sense of &#8216;possible&#8217; relevant to these interpretations to be one that reflects an agent&#8217;s capacities). The second and weakest requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to &#1092;, it must be possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason if A possessed certain qualities. The last and moderate requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to &#1092;, it must be possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason if A possessed certain qualities and A either has these qualities, or it is possible for her to get herself into a state where she has them. I argue for a value theory of reasons that employs this last, moderate motivational requirement. I argue that a value theory that adopts the moderate motivational requirement is best, as it allows the theory to be practically useful; reasons on this account have a role in deterrence, encouragement and praise- and blame-worthiness. The theory also aligns with a plausible account of eligible candidates for reasons. While the employment of the moderate motivational requirement in a value theory of reasons likens the theory, in some respects, to a desire theory, it avoids the objections raised against desire theories of reasons. In this way, a value theory of reasons that employs the moderate motivational requirement combines the attractive features of a desire theory and a value theory. Specifically, it generates reasons that are both dependent on an individual&#8217;s qualities, and also aligned with an account of value.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reasons; capacities rationality; value; desires</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Pragmatism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of climate and cultural practices on grapevine flowering and yield components.</field><field name="creator">McLoughlin, Suzanne Jean</field><field name="description">This thesis presents results from two separate studies. First, the impact of bearer length on yield components within the canopy was investigated in season 2005/06, on a commercially-managed, mechanically-pruned vineyard of Vitis vinifera L. Cabernet Sauvignon in Coonawarra, South Australia. Pruning resulted in the retention of bearers with 1-7 nodes, with the weighted average bearer length being two nodes for the canopy. As bearers of one to five nodes in length were the most common, these were studied. Yield components (on a per shoot basis) were analysed according to the node position on the bearer at which the shoot arose. Both budburst and inflorescence number per node were highest at the distal node positions on each length bearer, even if the nodes were at the same positions from the base of the bearer and would normally be expected to have similar fertility. Budburst appeared to act by modifying inflorescence number per node based on the relative location of each node from the apex of the bearer. Shoots that arose from the most distal node positions had the highest flower number per inflorescence and berry number per bunch. Flower number per inflorescence was significantly higher on two-inflorescence shoots than single-inflorescence shoots. The relationship between bunch size and node position, unlike that between inflorescence number and node position, was dependent on bearer length. The relative size of the inflorescence appeared to be affected more so by the node pOSition at which the shoot occurred on the bearer, as opposed to the actual node position on the shoot at which the inflorescence occurred. There was a positive, non-linear relationship between average fruit yield per bearer and bearer length. Although yield was highest from the bearer with the highest node number (five nodes), there was no significant difference in yield per bearer for the bearers of three to five nodes in length. If average bearer length was increased from two to three nodes, the potential yield gain per bearer is estimated at 38 per cent. The second study presents results of correlations between bunch number and components of bunch weight (flower number and berry number) to investigate co-development of bunch number and bunch size. These data were collected from 4 vineyards in the Limestone Coast Zone of South Australia from Vilis vinifera L. Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabemet Sauvignon during seasons 2002/03 to 2006/07. The significant correlations found between fertility and both bunch weight and flower number per inflorescence suggest that the same factors that affect bunch number in a particular season will also affect bunch size. When inflorescence primordia were initiated and differentiated under cool conditions, actual bunches per node and flowers per inflorescence were low. Differences in climate between the vineyard sites were found to be minimal and therefore did not strongly affect the magnitude of the yield components at the vineyard sites. Cultural practices at each vineyard site were sufficiently variable to affect fertility levels. Genotype is thought to determine the range of flowers per inflorescence that a variety can potentially carry, whereas actual flower number per inflorescence is thought to be determined by inflorescence primordium initiation and differentiation temperatures, as well as temperatures during budburst. Despite significant correlations between flower number per inflorescence and berry number per bunch, flower number per inflorescence preflowering for Cabemet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Chardonnay is inversely related to actual percentage fruit set. This is possibly a survival mechanism for the grapevine as it allows the vine to maximise yield each season without detriment to its longevity. Bunches per vine accounted for the majority of the seasonal variation in yield per vine. Fluctuations in bunch number per vine (and therefore yield) are likely to be reduced by varying the number of nodes retained per vine according to the relative fruitfulness per node present pre-pruning. This practice is therefore likely to result in the seasonal variation of berries per bunch becoming a stronger driver of yield. The commercial impacts of these studies are two-fold. Data presented will assist growers to understand the reasons for which their pruning regimes are affecting yield production and how these pruning regimes may be modified to achieve a target yield-particularly when growers are faced with seasons of low predicted fertility. In addition, data presented will allow growers to improve their crop forecasting accuracy, with a greater understanding of the link between bunch number and bunch size. In the current situation of oversupply in the wine industry, wineries are adopting a tough stance towards growers over-delivering on their grape contracts. Therefore, any assistance that can be provided to growers on improving accuracy of yield estimates will be beneficial both to the grower and winery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; yield; node position; bearer length; berry number per bunch; flower number per inflorescence; climate</field><field name="subject">Grapes Climatic factors.</field><field name="subject">Crops and climate Australia.</field><field name="subject">Crop yields Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying nutritive, physical and volatile characteristics of oaten and lucerne hay that affect the short-term feeding preferences of lactating Holstein Friesian cows and Thoroughbred horses.</field><field name="creator">Pain, Sarah Jean.</field><field name="description">Feeding behaviour is controlled by the integration of both perceived cues from the plant and postingestive signals received by the animal. In general practice, dairy cattle are presented with a variety of feedstuffs throughout each day, in addition to changing feedstuffs over time. In the Australian context, the feeds generally include fodder (usually hay) and pasture whilst grazing, as well as various concentrates. For horses that are stabled for prolonged periods, their diet consists of fodder (again usually hay or chaff) and concentrates, in addition to the pasture consumed whilst allowed access to graze. In such situations, where animals are presented with a range of feedstuffs, some of them novel and for discrete periods of time, it is important that they readily accept the feeds when they are first presented to them. For both lactating dairy cows and performance horses, for example, it is important to avoid periods of low intake, as this can have immediate and sometimes longer-term consequences to animal performance. The daily rate of food intake is the single most important factor affecting animal performance and productivity (Illius et al. 2000) and an animal&#8223;s responses to a feedstuff can be considered the ultimate measure of its quality. The animal&#8223;s first response to the presentation of a new feed, which in this particular study was oaten or lucerne hay, is its level of voluntary intake, which depends in part on palatability. Palatability is an integrative term (Provenza 1995); to provide a quantitative measure of the acceptability of a feedstuff, a &#8222;preference value&#8217; can be obtained by describing the preference of one hay relative to an alternate hay also on offer. The Australian fodder industry is increasingly adopting more objective measures of hay quality to improve marketing opportunities, especially in the export industry, and to meet the demands and expectations of local and overseas purchasers of hay. Being able to efficiently and reliably predict the preference value of any particular hay would be beneficial to processors, exporters, users (purchasers) of hay, and possibly plant breeders, to make more informed decisions. This thesis describes a comprehensive analysis of the chemical and physical characteristics of a selected number of oaten and lucerne hays and their relationship to the acceptability or &#8222;preference value&#8223; of the hays for lactating Holstein Friesian cows and Thoroughbred horses. The project aimed to (i) quantify preference values for a large number of oaten hays with dairy cows and horses and a similarly large number of lucerne hays with horses only, and (ii) develop predictive equations for animal preferences based on the chemical and physical properties of the hays and the animal&#8223;s short-term rate of consuming the hays. A total of approximately 8,500 preference tests were conducted with 85 oaten hays offered to lactating Holstein Friesian cows and Thoroughbred horses, and 70 lucerne hays offered to Thoroughbred horses. The hays were selected to cover a range of nutritive values. The intake rate and preferences for all the hays were quantified in a series of tests replicated over time and with different animals. Each &#8222;trial&#8223; hay was offered with four &#8222;standard&#8223; hays (in separate tests). A suite of chemical (nutritive value) traits and physical traits were quantified for the hays. An assessment of the &#8222;odour profile&#8223; was also included in the characterisation of the hays. The nutritive, physical and volatile traits were then related to hay preference values in multiple and simple linear regression models and equations generated to predict hay preference values. A prediction of hay preference made directly from the spectra obtained by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was also developed. Overall, the average preference value of an oaten hay (i.e., that obtained using the comparisons with all four standard hays) could be predicted from a range of nutritive value traits, typically the contents of acid detergent fibre (ADF), hemicellulose, crude protein (CP) and water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) - with a correlation co-efficient of about 79% with cows and 61% for horses. Acid detergent fibre and CP contents tended to have the biggest influence on preference value for both cows and horses, followed by WSC and hemicellulose content. Examination of lucerne hays offered to horses increased the correlation co-efficient to 74%, with ADF, hemicellulose and CP each having a similar magnitude of effect. This means that these traits, with an appropriate weighting for each, could account for up to about three-quarters of the variation in hay preference values for cows and horses. The in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVD) of oaten and lucerne hay was nearly as accurate in predicting preference values as using the four nutritive value traits of ADF, hemicellulose, CP and WSC, which was anticipated as digestibility is a function of these chemical traits. Hay physical traits could also be used to predict preference values, although not as accurately as the nutritive value traits or IVD. Of the physical traits, shear energy had the largest effect (co-efficient approximately -1.15 compared to an average of -0.35 for the other traits in the equation). The use of NIRS to directly predict preference values was also encouraging, with the best calibration model yielding a correlation co-efficient of 61 to 81%, depending on the hay (oaten or lucerne) and the animal (cows or horses). Of the total 120 volatile compounds isolated from the oaten hays, six had some relationship with cow preferences and there were also six oaten hay volatiles related to horse preferences. Of the oaten hay volatiles significantly related to preference, four were positively related to cow preference whilst two were negatively related to cow preference. Similarly there were four volatiles positively related to horse preference and two consistently negatively related. Of the six oaten hay volatiles found to influence the preferences of dairy cows and horses, four were common to both species. Of the total of 147 volatile compounds isolated from the lucerne hays, 15 had some relationship with horse preference, with nine positively related to horse preference and six negatively related. The data reported here suggest that a predicted preference value for a hay can be generated using commonly measured quality traits, which would improve a buyer&#8223;s confidence of animals responding favourably when first offered the hay. More specifically, for an average preference value, the most reliable prediction equation was based on nutritive value traits: ADF, hemicellulose, crude protein and water soluble carbohydrates solely. Alternatively a combination of nutritive and physical traits can be used to predict preference: in vitro digestibility, crude protein, water soluble carbohydrates and shear energy. The visible and near infrared spectra obtained by NIRS was also a promising method of prediction, and given the speed and affordability of NIRS, this technology could be further refined and used for routine measurement of predicted hay preference values. The volatile compounds shown to influence preference value of the hay should be identified and further research undertaken to investigate novel approaches to manipulate the preference of hays. Caution should be taken when attempting to use these prediction equations on a single specific hay in a single specific situation. The predictions and relationships investigated in this thesis are based on populations of hays and preferences of a group of animals and therefore some care should be taken when applying them to a particular situation with difference circumstances. Other factors that can influence feed preferences include an animal&#8223;s feeding experiences, basal diet and diet history and various environmental factors unaccounted for here.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Short-term reference; Oaten hay; Lucerne hay; Dairy cow; Horse; Nutritive value; Physical trait; Volatile characteristic</field><field name="subject">Hay as feed.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using computers to facilitate formative assessment of open-ended written assignments : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jun</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an e-learning solution to facilitate formative assessment of electronically submitted open-ended written assignments.It is widely accepted that formative assessment is highly beneficial to student leaning. A number of researchers are active in developing specialized approaches and software systems for assisting formative assessment of student work. However, no comprehensive e-learning solution exists for facilitating formative assessment of students' open-ended written work. The project presented in this thesis has developed a new approach for using computers to facilitate formative assessment of electronically submitted open-ended written assignments.Based on the literature review of the education theories around formative assessment and current computer software technologies, this project has developed three principles for e-learning support for formative assessment of open-ended written assignments:1. It needs to facilitate all the activities that are potentially required for formative assessment of student assignments (for example, the creation of assessment criteria, the submission of assignments, and the analysis of the assessment results), not only the marking activity to create feedback on assignments.2. It needs to provide an onscreen marking tool which enables human markers to mark open-ended written assignments in an intuitive and efficient way by replicating their paper-based assessment approaches.3. It needs to provide a generic solution for facilitating formative assessment of open-ended written assignments from all disciplines, not a limited solution restricted to some specific domains (for example, computers science or business courses).Based on these principles, a specification of an e-learning system for facilitating formative assessment of open-ended written assignment was developed and a system was implemented accordingly. This system, called the Written Assignment Assessment (WAA) system, has been already used in the assignment marking of several courses at Massey University.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">formative assessment</field><field name="subject">open-ended</field><field name="subject">written assignments</field><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern &#8211;how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction and transmission of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Maori folklore</field><field name="subject">Maori stories</field><field name="subject">cognitive models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological investigations of surveillance strategies of zoonotic Salmonella : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Benschop, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the application of recently developed epidemiological and statistical tools to inform the optimisation of a national surveillance strategy of considerable importance to human health. The results of a series of epidemiological investigations of surveillance strategies for zoonotic Salmonella are presented. Salmonella are one of the most common and serious zoonotic foodborne pathogenic bacteria globally. These studies were motivated by the increasing focus on the cost-effectiveness of surveillance while maintaining consumer confidence in food supply. Although data from the Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme has been used in these investigations, the techniques may be readily applied to other surveillance data of similar quality. The first study describes the spatial epidemiological features of Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme data from 1995 to 2004, using a novel method of spatially adaptive smoothing. The conditional probability of a farm being a case was consistently high in the the south-west of Sonderjylland on the Jutland peninsula, identifying this area for further investigation and targeted surveillance. The identification of clustering of case farms led into the next study, which closely examines one year of data, 2003, for patterns of spatial dependency. K-function analyses provided evidence for aggregation of Salmonella case farms over that of all farms at distances of up to six kilometres. Visual semivariogram analyses of random farm-level effects from a Bayesian logistic regression model (adjusted for herd size) of Salmonella seropositivity, revealed spatial dependency between pairs of farms up to a distance of four kilometres apart. The strength of the spatial dependency was positively associated with slaughter pig farm density. We describe how this might inform the surveillance programme by potentially targeting herds within a four kilometre radius of those with high levels of Salmonella infection. In the third study, farm location details, routinely recorded surveillance information, and industry survey data from 1995 were combined to build a logistic seroprevalence model. This identified wet-feeding and specific pathogen free herd health status as protective factors for Salmonella seropositivity, while purchasing feed was a risk factor. Once adjusting for these covariates, we identified pockets of unexplained risk for Salmonella seropositivity and found spatial dependency at distances of up to six km (95% CI: 2&#8211;35 km) between farms. A generalised linear spatial model was fitted to the Jutland data allowing formal estimation of the range of spatial correlation and a measure of the uncertainty about it. There was a large within-farm component to the variance, suggesting that gathering more farm level information would be advantageous if this approach was to be used to target surveillance strategy. The fourth study again considers data from the whole study period, 1995 to 2004. A detailed temporal analysis of the data revealed there was no consistent seasonal pattern and correspondingly no benefit in targeting sampling to particular times of the year. Spatiotemporal analyses suggested a local epidemic of increased seroprevalence occured in west Jutland in late 2000. Lorelogram analyses showed a defined period of statistically significant temporal dependency, suggesting that there is little value in sampling more frequently than every 10 weeks on the average farm. The final study uses findings from the preceding chapters to develop a zero-inflated binomial model which predicts which farms are most at risk of Salmonella, and then preferentially samples these high-risk farms. This type of modelling allows assessment of similarities and differences between factors that affect herd infection status (introduction) and those that affect the seroprevalence in infected herds (persistence and spread). The model suggested that many of the herds where Salmonella was not detected were infected but at a low prevalence. Using cost and sensitivity, we compared the results with those under the standard sampling scheme based on herd size, and the recently introduced risk-based approach. Model based results were less sensitive, but showed significant cost savings. Further model refinements, sampling schemes, and the methods to evaluate their performance are important areas for future work, and should continue to occur in direct consultation with Danish authorities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foodborne pathogen</field><field name="subject">data analyses</field><field name="subject">high-risk farms</field><field name="subject">animal infection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispositional coping styles and adult literacy : exploring stress and coping in adult vocational training environments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Murray, Nicola Sheree</field><field name="description">Since the publication of the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) findings in 1996, governments internationally have been cognisant of the need for functional literacy skill training for large segments of the New Zealand working-age population (Culligan1, Arnold, Noble, &amp; Sligo, 2004; Ministry of Education, 2001; OECD, 2000). Individuals with low literacy levels generally report negative prior experiences of formal learning environments that are due to and have contributed to their current functional literacy capability (for example, see Neubauer &amp; Dusewicz, 1988; Ross, 1987, 1988; Tilley et al., 2006). The present study aimed to systematically investigate and measure the dispositional coping styles and strategies associated with differing prose literacy capabilities. The purpose of this project was to provide an understanding of the coping-literacy relationship as a first step toward the development of coping strategy training interventions specifically targeted at improving the educational experience (current and future) of low literacy individuals. Secondary aims of the current study included exploring the relationship between persistence and coping style, adaptability, and prose literacy; determining whether and how coping styles, adaptability, and prose literacy changed over time; and, assessing the relationship between prose literacy, coping style, adaptability, and post-course goal achievement. Fifty-six students in adult vocational programmes were interviewed pre- and post-course. At each time point assessments of dispositional coping style and strategies via use of the COPE tool (Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989) were gathered, as were measures of emotional intelligence (including adaptability), and prose literacy score. Participants also took part in a semi-structured qualitative interview which gathered information on their educational and employment history, and goals post-course. Situational assessments of coping behaviours outside of the course were also gathered as part of a larger study for future analysis purposes and are outside the scope of this thesis. Respondents were also interviewed at three and six months post-course to determine achievement or non-achievement of post-course goals. Low prose literacy scores were significantly associated with more frequent use of emotionfocused coping strategies (particularly avoidance). Higher prose literacy scores were significantly associated with more frequent use of problem-focused coping strategies. Indicative data showed that non-persisting participants showed higher emotion-focused coping strategy use than their persisting counterparts alongside lower prose literacy scores. Further, emotionfocused coping, adaptability, and prose literacy score were found to change significantly over time. However, post-course goal achievement was not significantly associated with any of the variables of interest except bivariately with prose literacy. The model of transactional stress and coping (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) and the control theory of self-regulation (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981, 2000) provided a framework for the discussion of the dispositional coping styles and strategies used by individuals of differing prose literacy ability. It was argued that a negative self-schema of the individual as a learner is developed through prior negative experiences of formal education. It was hypothesised that this negative self-schema, built from a low self-confidence and fear of educational failure and rejection, predisposed the individual to a heightened negative self-focus. This in turn was proposed to direct attention to the self and the associated emotional aspects of a response to a stressor, leading to a bias towards habitual coping strategies of avoidance and less frequent use of problem-focused strategies by this group. These findings and the associated interpretations have implications for the future development of coping strategy training interventions for individuals with low functional literacy competencies who wish to re-engage with formal education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult literacy</field><field name="subject">coping styles</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">prose literacy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of consuming farmed salmon compared to salmon oil capsules on long chain omega 3 fatty acid and selenium status in humans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Human Nutrition, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pauga, Melanie</field><field name="description">Salmon is a good source of long chain (LC) omega 3 fatty acids and selenium; these are well recognised for their health benefits. Recommendations for LC omega 3 fatty acid intakes presume equivalence between fish and fish oil. The aim of this research was to compare the effects of consuming salmon with salmon oil capsules on LC omega 3 fatty acid and selenium status. Forty four healthy subjects were randomly assigned to consume either two servings of 120 g farmed New Zealand King (FNZK) salmon/week or 2, 4 or 6 capsules of salmon oil/day for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples, anthropometric measures, food consumption habits information and blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained at the study commencement and ending. Each subject&#8217;s intake of LC omega 3 fatty acids and selenium was determined by analysing the fatty acid and selenium content of duplicate portions of cooked salmon and capsules. The amount of salmon consumed was then calculated by subtracting unconsumed amounts of salmon and then calculating the intake of LC omega 3 fatty acids as grams of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed per day. Percentage of compliance to capsule intake, based on counts of unconsumed capsules, was calculated to determine the amount of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed per day from capsules. Change in red blood cells (RBC) LC omega 3 fatty acid levels from equivalent amounts of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed from capsules and salmon were compared using linear regression analysis predictive models fitted to the capsule data. Omega 3 index was calculated. LC omega 3 fatty acid intakes from salmon and 2, 4 and 6 capsules were 0.82, 0.24, 0.47 and 0.68 g/day, respectively. Equal amounts of LC omega 3 fatty acids consumed from salmon and capsules resulted in similar increases in RBC LC omega 3 fatty acids and omega 3 index (RBC eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): 0.80 [0.58 &#8211; 1.02] vs. 1.00 [0.71 &#8211; 1.27] %; RBC docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): 0.93 [0.58 &#8211; 1.29] vs. 0.99 [0.68 &#8211; 1.31] %; omega 3 index: 1.92 [1.46 &#8211; 2.38] vs. 2.25 [1.65 &#8211; 2.83] %).

This thesis examines the role that the Queensland colonial government, the medical profession, and the communities of Toowoomba and Brisbane played in the fight against the disease. At separation from New South Wales the Queensland government officials were new and inexperienced and had inherited a financial debt. These circumstances resulted in cautionary governance when it came to public health policy and issues, but determination and single-mindedness when it came to development of roads and railway lines. The government&#8217;s view at the time was if the colony was to prosper then this type of infrastructure must be developed at all costs. What the government failed to realise was that the infrastructure of drainage and sewerage, associated with good public health policies, needed to go side by side with other types of infrastructure. The prosperity of the colony rested on the health of its people. Because of the failure of the government to recognise the value of strong public health legislation it was up to the medical profession and the community to be vigilant and take the challenge to the government. This study has found that throughout the second half of the nineteenth century the medical profession and the community with the support of various newspapers had to challenge the government on public health issues consistently in relation to typhoid fever. This political pressure was more successful in Toowoomba where William Groom&#8217;s leadership achieved some important engineering solutions whereas campaigns in the capital, Brisbane, were marked by diversity and divisions. Intransigent colonial government policy condemned both cities to inadequate sanitation infrastructure until the twentieth century.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">typhoid fever</field><field name="subject">Toowoomba</field><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation of an integrated approach to sustainable water management in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Vo, Phu Le</field><field name="description">In 1986, Vietnam opened up the country&#8217;s economy by launching the Doi Moi (renovation) policy, which made the process of economic liberalisation possible. Accordingly, Ho Chi Minh City, the country&#8217;s biggest city, has undergone rapid growth of population, urbanisation and industrialisation. While achieving remarkable economic growth, the city faces considerable urban environmental challenges. The rapid growth of urbanisation and industry has placed increasing pressure on available freshwater resources, through excessive water use and increasing volumes of untreated wastewater. Firstly, the urban water sector has had to meet growing demand for water use for domestic purposes during the dry season. Secondly, groundwater levels have experienced a substantial drawdown in outlying urban districts as a result of over-abstraction. Thirdly, rapidly expanding industrial activities are causing severe demand on water resources. The city&#8217;s major supply sources have developed an alarming level of pollutants discharged by industry.  The aim of this thesis is to formulate an integrated approach to the sustainable management of water resources in Ho Chi Minh City. In order to achieve this, the research was designed to examine institutional frameworks and arrangements and to explore the perception of water value by water users and stakeholders. The underlying reasons for ineffective management are anchored in fragmented management practices which result from inadequate institutional frameworks and arrangements, inadequate regulations and inappropriate water governance. Weak enforcement of law and insufficient cooperation between government agencies and departments in Ho Chi Minh City and their counterparts in neighbouring provinces also limit management efficacy.  The research results show that stakeholders have different perceptions of water resources. Overall, water value has been considered as a social and economic good by both the urban respondents and government officials. However, most urban residents view water as a social good rather than an economic one. Public involvement in the water sector is limited. Most urban dwellers have little understanding and knowledge about the city&#8217;s water issues or the available channels to access information on water resources.  Many government officials are inadequately trained, poorly qualified, inexperienced and have irrelevant or outdated background knowledge about their field of management. Government respondents did not provide consistent data and information on the water profile because there is no shared common information on water issues in place. Findings from the fieldwork show that decentralisation, privatisation and using rainwater as a potential alternative water source are preferred.  Finally, the study proposes a schematic revision of existing management structures and mechanisms between local government agencies. This thesis proposes a model for a water conservation strategy for which the management and use of water resources is aligned with adequate institutional arrangements and effective regulations. Water governance and management of water resources need to work with economic and urbanisation growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formulation; Integrated approach; Water management; Ho Chi Minh City; Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultra-high energy particle detection with the lunar Cherenkov technique.</field><field name="creator">James, Clancy William</field><field name="description">The lunar Cherenkov technique is a promising method to resolve the mystery of the origin of the highest energy particles in nature, the ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays. By pointing Earth-based radio-telescopes at the Moon to look for the characteristic nanosecond pulses of radio-waves produced when a UHE particle interacts in the Moon&#8217;s outer layers, either the cosmic rays (CR) themselves, or their elusive counterparts, the UHE neutrinos, may be detected. The LUNASKA collaboration aims to develop both the theory and practice of the lunar Cherenkov technique in order to utilise the full sensitivity of the next generation of giant radio telescope arrays in searching for these extreme particles. My PhD project, undertaken as part of the collaboration, explores three key aspects of the technique. In the first three chapters, I describe a Monte Carlo simulation I wrote to model the full range of lunar Cherenkov experiments. Using the code, I proceed to calculate the aperture to, and resulting limits on, a UHE neutrino flux from the Parkes lunar Cherenkov experiment, and to highlight a pre-existing discrepancy between existing simulation programs. An expanded version of the simulation is then used to determine the sensitivity of past and future lunar Cherenkov experiments to UHE neutrinos, and also the expected event rates for a range of models of UHE CR production. Limits on the aperture of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to UHE CR are also calculated. The directional dependence of both the instantaneous sensitivity and time-integrated exposure of the aforementioned experiments is also calculated. Combined, these results point the way towards an optimal way utilisation of a giant radio-array such as the SKA in detecting UHE particles. The next section describes my work towards developing accurate parameterisations of the coherent Cherenkov radiation produced by UHE showers as expected in the lunar regolith. I describe a &#8216;thinning&#8217; algorithm which was implemented into a pre-existing electromagnetic shower code, and the extensive measures taken to check its veracity. Using the code, a new parameterisation for radiation from electromagnetic showers is developed, accurate for the first time up to UHE energies. The existence of secondary peaks in the radiation spectrum is predicted, and their significance for detection experiments discussed. Finally, I present the data analysis from three runs of LUNASKA&#8217;s on-going observation program at the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The unusual nature of the experiment required both new methods and hardware to be developed, and I focus on the timing and sensitivity calibrations. The loss of sensitivity from finite-sampling of the electric field is modelled for the first time. Timing and dispersive constraints are used to determine that no pulses of lunar origin were detected, and I use my simulation software to calculate limits on an UHE neutrino flux from the experiment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio astronomy; UHE neutrinos, UHE cosmic ray; coherent radio emission; electromagnetic simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Lapita in near Oceania : intertidal and shallow-water pottery scatters, Roviana Lagoon, New Georgia, Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Felgate, Matthew Walter</field><field name="description">Lapita is the name given by archaeologists to a material culture complex distributed from Papua New Guinea to Samoa about 3000 years ago, which marks major economic changes in Near Oceania and the first settlement by humans of Remote Oceania. Those parts of Solomon Islands that lie in Near Oceania, together with Bougainville, comprise a large gap in the recorded distribution of Lapita, which the current research seeks to explain. At Roviana Lagoon, centrally located in this gap, scatters of pottery, stone artefacts, and other stone items are found in shallow water in this sheltered, landlocked lagoon, initially thought to be late derivatives of Lapita. This research seeks method and theory to aid in the interpretation of this type of archaeological record. Intensive littoral survey discovered a wider chronological range of pottery styles than had previously been recorded, including materials attributable directly to the Lapita material culture complex. A study of vessel brokenness and completeness enabled sample evaluation, estimation of a parent population from which the sample derived, assessment of the state of preservation of the sample, and systematic choice of unit of quantification. Studies of wave exposure of collection sites and taphonomic evidence from sherds concluded that the cultural formation process of these sites was stilt house settlement (as found elsewhere in Near Oceania for Lapita) over deeper water than today. Falling relative sea levels and consequent increasing effects of swash-zone processes have resulted in high archaeological visibility and poor state of preservation at Roviana Lagoon. Analysis of ceramic and lithic variability and spatial analysis allowed the construction of a provisional chronology in need of further testing. Indications are that there is good potential to construct a robust, high-resolution ceramic chronology by focussing on carefully controlled surface collection from this sort of location, ceramic seriation and testing/calibration using direct dating by AMS radiocarbon and Thermoluminescence. Data on preservation and archaeological visibility of stilt house settlements along a sheltered emerging coastline allows preservation and visibility for this type of settlement to be modeled elsewhere. When such a model is applied to other areas of the Lapita gap, which are predominantly either less favourable for preservation or less favourable for archaeological visibility, the gap in the distribution of Lapita can be seen to be an area of low probability of detection by archaeologists, meaning there is currently no evidence for absence of settlement in the past, and good reason to think that Lapita was continuously distributed across Near Oceania as a network of stilt village settlement. This finding highlights the need for explicit models of probability of detection to discover or read the Lapita archaeological record.

In several plant pathogenic fungi viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) elements have been shown to be the agents responsible for this attenuation of virulence. In New Zealand and other temperate climates the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea is an important pathogen of many horticultural crops. Control of this grey mould disease still relies heavily on the use of fungicides to augment cultural practices- Consequently, there is now increasing interest in the use of biological control as an alternative means of control. This study reports the first large-scale survey of dsRNA elements in B. cinerea. Analysis of 200 New Zealand isolates from a range of hosts revealed 72% contained dsRNA, with high variation in dsRNA profiles, both within and between groups of fungal isolates from different hosts. DsRNA has been associated with isometric particles in many different fungi. In this study virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in three of five dsRNA-containing isolates examined. Morphological types included isometric particles of varying size classes (approx' 30, 35, 40 and 45 nm) and bacilliform parricles (approx. 25 x 63 nm). In five isolates apparently lacking dsRNA no isometric or bacilliform particles were found but flexuous rods with a modal length of approx. 7ZO nm were detected in one of these isolates. Total RNA extraction of the various partially purified VLP preparations gave similar profiles to those obtained from mycelial dsRNA extractions of the same isolates, suggesting that the VLPs comprise encapsidated dsRNA. Comparison of 12 dsRNA-containing and 12 dsRNA-free isolates indicated slight differences between the two groups in radial growth rate, virulence on bean leaves and sclerotial number, but the differences were minor. ln summary, while dsRNA was found to be common among B. cinerea isolates in this study, the evidence did not reveal any marked phenotypic effects of dsRNA presence. The putative flexuous rod-shaped virus particles rn B. cinerea were studied further. Similar particles have been observed in fungi before but none have been characterised at the molecular level. This study reports the first complete nucleotide sequences of two such mycoviruses, Botrytis Virus F (BVF) and Botrytis Virus X (BVX), and also the first molecular characterisation of viruses infecting B. cinerea. The mycoviruses, which were both present in the same B. cinerea isolate, were similar in size and morphology to ssRNA plant viruses of the family Potexviridae. BVF and BVX contained ssRNA genomes af 6827 and 6966 nucleotides respectively, excluding poly(A) tails. Computer analysis of the genomic cDNA sequence of BVF revealed three potential open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative proteins of 20 kDa (ORFI),212 kDa (ORFZ) and 32 kDa (ORF3). ORFI, which overlapped ORF2 by 467 nt, did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences.O RF2, which showed significant sequence identity to the replicase proteins of the plant virus families Tymoviridae and potexviridae, contained a putative opal readthrough codon intermediate between the helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) regions. ORF3 shared amino acid homology with coat proteins of the family Potexviridae. A putative defective RNA (D RNA) of 829 nt was also detected which consisted of a 5' region of the parental genome fused in-frame to the terminal 3' end, complete with poly(A) tail. BVX revealed five potential ORFs encoding putative proteins of 158 kDa (ORFl), 30 kDa (ORF2), 44y,Da(ORF3), 14 kDa (ORF4) and l4kDa (ORFs). ORFI showed significant amino acid sequenceid entity to the replicase proteins and ORF3 to the coat proteins of the potexviridae. The remaining ORFs did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences. This is the first report of sequence similarities between mycoviruses and the plant virus families Potexviridae and Tymoviridae. Comparisons of sequence and genome organisation suggest that the mycoviruses BVF and BVX may each belong to a new as yet unassigned genus in the plant virus family Potexviridae. An unexpected result from this study was the high level of identity observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the mycoviruses and plant viruses including a region of -7O% for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) region of BVX and similar regions in several potex-like viruses of AIIium spp. This high level of interviral homology has not previously been reported between the plant and fungal kingdoms and is possibly indicative of a recent divergence from a common ancestor. These results suggest that horizontal gene transfer between the plant and fungal kingdoms may occur more frequently than has been appreciated to date. If so it may play a significant role in viral evolution. In addition to providing novel phylogenetic information on the relationship between these morphological types of viruses in fungi and in plants, characterisation of these mycoviral genomes provides a possible strategy for incorporating genes into Botrytis using viruses as vectors. In this context Botrytis strains infected with modified viruses could provide a new approach for the biocontrol of grey mould.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tracey, Jocelyn Margaret</field><field name="description">The Reaccreditation Programme of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (RNZCGP) became compulsory for all members in 1994. Ongoing reaccreditation of medical specialists is a new, but rapidly growing trend on which little research has been done. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand in the first three years of the programme. The history and current status of reaccreditation programmes throughout the world is summarised. The requirements of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme are described and contrasted with the requirements of other programmes. A basic assumption of the Reaccreditation Programme that general practitioners can accurately identify their own areas of deficiency, is tested and found to be incorrect. A very low correlation between general practitioners' self assessments of knowledge on a given topic, and their results on a written objective test was found. The attitudes of general practitioners to the Reaccreditation programme, both shortly before it began and three years post-implementation are tested using a validated semantic differential questionnaire. Initial acceptance was reasonably high, but this decreased with time. Qualitative and quantitative studies of the ways in which general practitioners have altered their educational activities because of the programme showed improvements in the quality of the activities selected, but little increase in overall time spent. Analysis of the effects of the compulsory audit aspect of the Reaccreditation Programme showed that this activity has resulted in significant improvements to patient care. The effects of the programme on general practice are analysed in the light of current change theories and finally recommendations are made regarding the possible future development of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The plug flow of paper pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Moller, Klaus</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis is part of a programme of research concerning the flow behaviour of paper pulp suspensions commenced at the University of Auckland in 1969. A primary aim of the research was to supply the industry with reliable pipe friction data for the pulps manufactured in New Zealand mills. Secondly, it was hoped to increase the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of flow of the suspensions in pipes and so devise a more satisfactory method of correlation than the one used at present. Pipe friction data were obtained for two N.Z. groundwood pulps, two N.Z. Kraft pulps and one imported Kraft pulp in 1, 2, 3 and 4 inch pipes for a wide range of consistencies and velocities. The data were of the same form as previously reported in the literature, but for a given set of conditions the friction losses were lower for the N.Z. pulps. For Kraft pulps the curves of head loss versus velocity exhibited the usual maxima and minima, but for groundwoods the decrease in head loss from the maximum to the minimum and the subsequent rise were replaced by an approximately level portion. The data in the regime before the maxima in the head loss curves for Kraft pulps were correlated to allow extrapolation to the larger pipes used in the paper mill. This regime incorporates the majority of practical flow situations for consistencies over two per cent. The limits of the regime were approximately defined by values of the dimensionless friction factor. The correlation method used was a slight modification of that employed by previous authors. The data for groundwood pulps were correlated in a similar way. The head losses predicted by the new correlations were consistently lower than those calculated from previous equations. Observation of the flow in perspex pipes confirmed the mechanisms of flow proposed by some previous authors, but disagreed with the mechanisms proposed by others. The mechanisms of flow of groundwood pulps were found to be essentially similar to those of Kraft pulps except that the groundwoods exhibited a plug cleavage phenomenon at very low velocities. The different shapes of friction curve for the two types of pulp were attributed directly to their macroscopic properties. A flow model was developed on the basis of the observed flow behaviour in pipes in which the suspensions move as a fibre/water plug surrounded by a sheared water annulus. The model assumed that the annulus formed as a result of the action of the hydrodynamic shear stress on the fibre network comprising the plug. The analysis resulted in an expression relating the average velocity and the longitudinal pressure gradient in the pipe and also incorporated the pipe radius, the viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; and a pseudo shear modulus for the fibre network G. The plug flow model was found to apply to the data in the regime before the maximum in the head loss curve. The relation between the pressure gradient and the pipe diameter as predicted by the model was slightly erroneous for some pulps, although it was the same as that in the standard empirical correlation used in design by the industry. This led to the conclusion that the deflection of fibre ends on the plug surface also contributed to the formation of the annulus, as proposed by previous authors. The relative importance of the two mechanisms of annulus formation was used to explain the occurrence of the maxima and minima in the head loss curves for chemical pulps. The plug flow model was found to be closely related to both the direct correlation method used in the past and to the standard pseudoplastic model for non-Newtonian pipe flow. The model was also applied to analogous flow in a rotational viscometer. The values of the pseudo shear modulus G calculated from the rotational viscometry data were the same as those calculated from pipe flow data under certain conditions. However, limitations in the equipment and the effect of gravitational settling restricted the results to a narrow range. The behaviour of the pulp suspensions in batch settling tests varied markedly from pulp to pulp. There was a high correlation between the pseudo shear modulus G obtained from pipe flow data and the final height of the suspension in a settling test. Likewise there was a relationship between the effective viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; (as modified by the proportion of fines in the pulp) and the initial settling rate in a batch test. This suggested that a simple and accurate method of determining pipe friction data from batch settling test data is possible. Settling tests also showed that air content and the presence of acidic and basic ions, but not the viscosity of the suspending medium, increased the strength of fibre networks. A further correlation method to incorporate all flow regimes was suggested from the results of the present investigation and from indications in the literature that fibre networks behave like Bingham plastics when they are sheared.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using computers to facilitate formative assessment of open-ended written assignments : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jun</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an e-learning solution to facilitate formative assessment of electronically submitted open-ended written assignments.It is widely accepted that formative assessment is highly beneficial to student leaning. A number of researchers are active in developing specialized approaches and software systems for assisting formative assessment of student work. However, no comprehensive e-learning solution exists for facilitating formative assessment of students' open-ended written work. The project presented in this thesis has developed a new approach for using computers to facilitate formative assessment of electronically submitted open-ended written assignments.Based on the literature review of the education theories around formative assessment and current computer software technologies, this project has developed three principles for e-learning support for formative assessment of open-ended written assignments:1. It needs to facilitate all the activities that are potentially required for formative assessment of student assignments (for example, the creation of assessment criteria, the submission of assignments, and the analysis of the assessment results), not only the marking activity to create feedback on assignments.2. It needs to provide an onscreen marking tool which enables human markers to mark open-ended written assignments in an intuitive and efficient way by replicating their paper-based assessment approaches.3. It needs to provide a generic solution for facilitating formative assessment of open-ended written assignments from all disciplines, not a limited solution restricted to some specific domains (for example, computers science or business courses).Based on these principles, a specification of an e-learning system for facilitating formative assessment of open-ended written assignment was developed and a system was implemented accordingly. This system, called the Written Assignment Assessment (WAA) system, has been already used in the assignment marking of several courses at Massey University.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">formative assessment</field><field name="subject">open-ended</field><field name="subject">written assignments</field><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispositional coping styles and adult literacy : exploring stress and coping in adult vocational training environments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Murray, Nicola Sheree</field><field name="description">Since the publication of the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) findings in 1996, governments internationally have been cognisant of the need for functional literacy skill training for large segments of the New Zealand working-age population (Culligan1, Arnold, Noble, &amp; Sligo, 2004; Ministry of Education, 2001; OECD, 2000). Individuals with low literacy levels generally report negative prior experiences of formal learning environments that are due to and have contributed to their current functional literacy capability (for example, see Neubauer &amp; Dusewicz, 1988; Ross, 1987, 1988; Tilley et al., 2006). The present study aimed to systematically investigate and measure the dispositional coping styles and strategies associated with differing prose literacy capabilities. The purpose of this project was to provide an understanding of the coping-literacy relationship as a first step toward the development of coping strategy training interventions specifically targeted at improving the educational experience (current and future) of low literacy individuals. Secondary aims of the current study included exploring the relationship between persistence and coping style, adaptability, and prose literacy; determining whether and how coping styles, adaptability, and prose literacy changed over time; and, assessing the relationship between prose literacy, coping style, adaptability, and post-course goal achievement. Fifty-six students in adult vocational programmes were interviewed pre- and post-course. At each time point assessments of dispositional coping style and strategies via use of the COPE tool (Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989) were gathered, as were measures of emotional intelligence (including adaptability), and prose literacy score. Participants also took part in a semi-structured qualitative interview which gathered information on their educational and employment history, and goals post-course. Situational assessments of coping behaviours outside of the course were also gathered as part of a larger study for future analysis purposes and are outside the scope of this thesis. Respondents were also interviewed at three and six months post-course to determine achievement or non-achievement of post-course goals. Low prose literacy scores were significantly associated with more frequent use of emotionfocused coping strategies (particularly avoidance). Higher prose literacy scores were significantly associated with more frequent use of problem-focused coping strategies. Indicative data showed that non-persisting participants showed higher emotion-focused coping strategy use than their persisting counterparts alongside lower prose literacy scores. Further, emotionfocused coping, adaptability, and prose literacy score were found to change significantly over time. However, post-course goal achievement was not significantly associated with any of the variables of interest except bivariately with prose literacy. The model of transactional stress and coping (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) and the control theory of self-regulation (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981, 2000) provided a framework for the discussion of the dispositional coping styles and strategies used by individuals of differing prose literacy ability. It was argued that a negative self-schema of the individual as a learner is developed through prior negative experiences of formal education. It was hypothesised that this negative self-schema, built from a low self-confidence and fear of educational failure and rejection, predisposed the individual to a heightened negative self-focus. This in turn was proposed to direct attention to the self and the associated emotional aspects of a response to a stressor, leading to a bias towards habitual coping strategies of avoidance and less frequent use of problem-focused strategies by this group. These findings and the associated interpretations have implications for the future development of coping strategy training interventions for individuals with low functional literacy competencies who wish to re-engage with formal education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult literacy</field><field name="subject">coping styles</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">prose literacy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country.

The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Families of Choice: A qualitative study of Australian families formed through intercountry adoption</field><field name="creator">Young, Alexandra Robin</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercountry adoption</field><field name="subject">family theory</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">adoption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and horses : a study of Australia's recreational horsewomen</field><field name="creator">Burr, Sandra</field><field name="description">This dissertation is a fusion of three grand passions that invigorate my life - a love of books and reading; a love of words and writing; and a profound and enduring love of horses. I am particularly attracted to the stories of other horsewomen, and while I identify with much that is written about women and horses, my own story and that of most contemporary Australian recreational horsewomen, is largely missing.

Australia has a long tradition of horsemanship, a culture which in recent decades has become largely feminised and mostly recreational. Despite this reorientation, horses continue to be associated with such durable tropes as the outback, and 'the race that stops a nation', yet these masculine discourses are no longer representative of modern equestrian culture. The profound changes in what was once a vital sector of Australian society have been overlooked by scholars and creative practitioners alike, and it is only now that Australia's contemporary horsewomen have become a topic of academic inquiry. By examining the nature of the relationships between women and horses, I illuminate this unique culture, and in doing so extend our understandings of what it is to be Australian.

I conducted the research using a combination of traditional and creative paradigms that allow multiple readings of what it is to be a horsewoman. The exegesis contains the data from which two interpretations of horsewomen emerge: an insider's view told by the women themselves; and an outsider's view constructed from an interpretive analysis of the data. My own subjective experiences are recorded in the collected essays, poems and visual material of the creative work. Taken as a whole the dissertation is a unique multi-layered account of modern Australian recreational horsewomen and they way operate in the world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">horses</field><field name="subject">horsewomen</field><field name="subject">creative</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20100415.131547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapiri t&#257;tou, hei manaaki tangata, hei manaaki whenua. Effective governance for urban sustainability</field><field name="creator">Webster, Karen Lesley</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of local government elected members to progress urban sustainability, and the views of M&#257;ori leaders&#8217; on governance and sustainability. It is set within a wider context of local government reform and changing expectations of governance and captures a point in time in the evolution of P&#257;keh&#257; and M&#257;ori governance structures in Aotearoa New Zealand. The thesis contributes to the paucity of scholarship in these fields.  Local government has evolved from the early provincial legislatures, to acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi and recognise the importance of sustainable development. The Local Government Act 2002 fundamentally changed the role and purpose of New Zealand local government. At the heart of both Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the LGA was the aspiration for community and M&#257;ori participation in local governance and progress towards sustainable development.  The &#8216;three-house concept&#8217; described in the Raukawa Trustees partnership-two cultures development model (Winiata 2005) and the Community Sector Taskforce (2006) model is reflected in the structure of this thesis. It provides for a P&#257;keh&#257; House, a Tikanga M&#257;ori House and a Treaty House &#8211; a conceptual space where M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; values and practices can come together in mutual respect. The P&#257;keh&#257; House of the thesis establishes a broader role for New Zealand elected members to promote urban sustainability by focusing on cross-sector collaboration and multi-level governance. While multi-level governing was found to be widespread across urban territorial authorities, an elected member focus on collaboration was notably absent. Aotearoa New Zealand&#8217;s urban local authorities had begun mainstreaming sustainable development practices. Environmental management and restoration activity was widespread. Initiatives progressing social and cultural well-being were gaining prominence. The Tikanga M&#257;ori House recognises that the LGA 2002 had failed to bring about transformation of M&#257;ori participation in local government. Where the M&#257;ori voice struggled to be heard, the Act&#8217;s discretionary provisions had tended to preserve the status quo. Two paths to the future are offered: firstly, constitutional change - a new system of local government that recognises the validity of tino rangatiratanga as an equal authority, which could be modeled on the working examples of Treaty-based governance presented in this thesis.  Secondly, improvements to the current system of local government are recommended. They are: - Hui and whanaungatanga, as a path to consensus decision-making. - Iwi authorities be recognised as local authorities, to provide opportunities for urban M&#257;ori to participate in local government. - The status of iwi management plans be lifted, and they be mandatory in the way that a district plan is mandatory. - The mana whenua relationship be strengthened to increase the capacity of mana whenua to consult with tauiwi in their rohe, and exercise kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga. These improvements need to be based on an effective parallel model of M&#257;ori representation, or M&#257;ori wards and seats. The Treaty House presents a case for strengthening a partnerships approach to governance. The effective inclusion of both P&#257;keh&#257; and M&#257;ori communities alike is identified as a prerequisite for further progress towards urban sustainability in Aotearoa New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Urban sustainability</field><field name="subject">Sutainable development</field><field name="subject">Elected member role</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology, mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Local government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of intermittent hypoxic exposure on physical performance in trained basketball players</field><field name="creator">Dobson, Bryan Paul</field><field name="description">Strong evidence exists to support the use of a continuous (&gt;8hr/day) hypoxic stimulus (either geographical altitude or simulated hypoxia) for enhancing the physical performance of endurance athletes. However, evidence supporting the use of acutely intermittent hypoxia (&lt;1hr/day) for enhancing performance is less clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of acutely intermittent hypoxic exposure on physiological and physical performance measures in team sport athletes. Using a single-blind controlled design, 14 trained basketball players (HYP = 7, CON = 7) were subjected to 15 days of intermittent hypoxia or normoxia. Each exposure was 37 minutes in duration (four cycles of 7min on, 3min off) and achieved using a nitrogen dilution device (Airo Ltd, Auckland, NZ). Prescribed peripheral oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) were maintained using an automatic biofeedback system and were progressively decreased from 86-89% on Day 1 to 75-78% on Day 15. A range of physiological measures and performance tests were conducted seven and two days before, and ten days after the intervention. The tests were: an incremental treadmill test to establish peak oxygen consumption ( peak) and running economy (RE), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test (YYIRT), and the Repeated High-Intensity Endurance Test (RHIET). Whole-blood samples were taken to assess a range of haematological measures. At 10 days post-intervention the HYP group, relative to the CON group, exhibited the following percent changes (&#177;90% confidence limits, CL), and effect sizes (ES; &#177;90% CL); YYIRT running speedpeak (4.8; &#177; 1.6%, ES: 1.0 &#177; 0.4; benefit almost certain), RHIET total sprint time (-3.5; &#177; 1.6%; ES: -0.4 &#177; 0.2; benefit very likely), RHIET slowest sprint time (-5.0; &#177; 2.4%; ES: -0.5 &#177; 0.2; benefit very likely), soluble transferrin receptor (9.2; &#177; 10.1%; ES: 0.3 &#177; 0.3; benefit possible) running economy (11km.hr-1) (-9.0; &#177; 9.7%; ES: -0.7 &#177; 0.7; benefit likely, probable), and running economy (13km.hr-1) (-8.2; &#177; 6.9%; ES: -0.7 &#177; 0.5; benefit likely, probable). Changes to running economy (9km.hr-1), peak, maximum heart rate and lactate and all other blood measures were unclear. In conclusion, acutely intermittent hypoxia resulted in worthwhile changes in physical performance of trained basketball players in tests relevant to competition. However, the lack of clear change in physiological and haematological measures makes it difficult to determine the underlying mechanism for such enhancement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intermittent Hypoxic exposure</field><field name="subject">Repeated speed</field><field name="subject">Aerobic capacity</field><field name="subject">Basketball</field><field name="subject">Hematology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultra-high energy particle detection with the lunar Cherenkov technique.</field><field name="creator">James, Clancy William</field><field name="description">The lunar Cherenkov technique is a promising method to resolve the mystery of the origin of the highest energy particles in nature, the ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays. By pointing Earth-based radio-telescopes at the Moon to look for the characteristic nanosecond pulses of radio-waves produced when a UHE particle interacts in the Moon&#8217;s outer layers, either the cosmic rays (CR) themselves, or their elusive counterparts, the UHE neutrinos, may be detected. The LUNASKA collaboration aims to develop both the theory and practice of the lunar Cherenkov technique in order to utilise the full sensitivity of the next generation of giant radio telescope arrays in searching for these extreme particles. My PhD project, undertaken as part of the collaboration, explores three key aspects of the technique. In the first three chapters, I describe a Monte Carlo simulation I wrote to model the full range of lunar Cherenkov experiments. Using the code, I proceed to calculate the aperture to, and resulting limits on, a UHE neutrino flux from the Parkes lunar Cherenkov experiment, and to highlight a pre-existing discrepancy between existing simulation programs. An expanded version of the simulation is then used to determine the sensitivity of past and future lunar Cherenkov experiments to UHE neutrinos, and also the expected event rates for a range of models of UHE CR production. Limits on the aperture of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to UHE CR are also calculated. The directional dependence of both the instantaneous sensitivity and time-integrated exposure of the aforementioned experiments is also calculated. Combined, these results point the way towards an optimal way utilisation of a giant radio-array such as the SKA in detecting UHE particles. The next section describes my work towards developing accurate parameterisations of the coherent Cherenkov radiation produced by UHE showers as expected in the lunar regolith. I describe a &#8216;thinning&#8217; algorithm which was implemented into a pre-existing electromagnetic shower code, and the extensive measures taken to check its veracity. Using the code, a new parameterisation for radiation from electromagnetic showers is developed, accurate for the first time up to UHE energies. The existence of secondary peaks in the radiation spectrum is predicted, and their significance for detection experiments discussed. Finally, I present the data analysis from three runs of LUNASKA&#8217;s on-going observation program at the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The unusual nature of the experiment required both new methods and hardware to be developed, and I focus on the timing and sensitivity calibrations. The loss of sensitivity from finite-sampling of the electric field is modelled for the first time. Timing and dispersive constraints are used to determine that no pulses of lunar origin were detected, and I use my simulation software to calculate limits on an UHE neutrino flux from the experiment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio astronomy; UHE neutrinos, UHE cosmic ray; coherent radio emission; electromagnetic simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical properties of passive rat cardiac trabeculae</field><field name="creator">Kirton, Robert S.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the mechanical properties of quiescent, intact, viable, rat right-ventricular (RV) trabeculae were investigated. The main objective was to determine if strainsoftening, which is commonly reported during the deformation of passive cardiac tissue, is present in viable trabeculae. Strain-softening is typically manifested by a stiffer force-extension relation in the first deformation cycle relative to subsequent cycles, and is distinguished from viscoelasticity by a lack of recovery of stiffness, even after several hours of rest. The causes of this behaviour are unknown. To investigate whether strain-softening is observed during uniaxial extensions of viable cardiac tissue, stretch and release cycles of 5%, 10% and 15% muscle length were applied at a constant velocity to trabeculae mounted in a mechanical rig. The rig was custom-built for the purpose. Muscles at 26&#176;C and 0.5 mM Ca2+ were tested in random order in the presence and absence of 50 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). Strain-softening was not observed in viable trabeculae undergoing physiologically relevant extensions, either in the presence or absence of BDM. However, strainsoftening was readily apparent in non-viable trabeculae undergoing the same levels of extension, whether in the presence or absence of BDM. BDM had no effect on passive compliance of viable specimens, while its presence partially inhibited, but could not prevent, stiffening of the non-viable specimens. Loss of viability was accompanied by a uniform increase of dynamic stiffness. The presence of strain-softening during length extensions of non-viable tissue, resulted in a uniform decrease of dynamic stiffness. It is therefore concluded that strain-softening is neither intrinsic to viable rat RV trabeculae nor influenced by BDM but, rather, reflects irreversible damage of tissue in partial, or full, rigor. The addition of BDM was found to alter the dynamic stiffness and phase measured in intact viable quiescent trabeculae. In the absence of BDM, these alterations were calcium- and temperature-sensitive, whereas in the presence of BDM they were not. Therefore, the BDM-induced alteration of the dynamic stiffness and phase is attributed to the inhibition of spontaneous sarcomere activity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tracey, Jocelyn Margaret</field><field name="description">The Reaccreditation Programme of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (RNZCGP) became compulsory for all members in 1994. Ongoing reaccreditation of medical specialists is a new, but rapidly growing trend on which little research has been done. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand in the first three years of the programme. The history and current status of reaccreditation programmes throughout the world is summarised. The requirements of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme are described and contrasted with the requirements of other programmes. A basic assumption of the Reaccreditation Programme that general practitioners can accurately identify their own areas of deficiency, is tested and found to be incorrect. A very low correlation between general practitioners' self assessments of knowledge on a given topic, and their results on a written objective test was found. The attitudes of general practitioners to the Reaccreditation programme, both shortly before it began and three years post-implementation are tested using a validated semantic differential questionnaire. Initial acceptance was reasonably high, but this decreased with time. Qualitative and quantitative studies of the ways in which general practitioners have altered their educational activities because of the programme showed improvements in the quality of the activities selected, but little increase in overall time spent. Analysis of the effects of the compulsory audit aspect of the Reaccreditation Programme showed that this activity has resulted in significant improvements to patient care. The effects of the programme on general practice are analysed in the light of current change theories and finally recommendations are made regarding the possible future development of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of New Zealand&#8217;s post-war inflation</field><field name="creator">Hall, V.B.</field><field name="description">Theoretical and empirical literature on inflation is extensive, and it abounds with diverse opinion. Principal works are of overseas origin; no substantial research has been published relating specifically to the New Zealand economy. This study does not attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of inflation, but has as its purpose the formulation of a simultaneous equation model to explain and predict movements in variables relevant to the inflationary process. The research has been conducted with New Zealand data and no econometric work on inflation yet published seems to have produced a model as embracing as the one advanced. This introduction has the following scope and content. First it conveys some idea of the extent of debate over what inflation is, this being done by brief references to various attempts at defining the phenomenon and to some of the different types of inflation advanced. Next, it questions more fundamentally 'what inflation is, and how, if' at all, the subject may be enlightened by further research. This leads on to derivation of an appropriate definition of inflation. Finally, an outline is given of the aspects of inflation to be investigated and the approach to be adopted.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of the common law defences of fair comment and qualified privilege to a defamation action with particular reference to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tobin, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of steroids by human mammary tissues</field><field name="creator">Couch, Ronald Alexander Fyfe</field><field name="description">Human mammary tissue was incubated in vitro with [7-3H] dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-sulphate) and in agreement with other investigators this steroid conjugate was metabolized to DHA and other steroid products.

Methods: One week old guinea pigs were monocularly deprived of form vision (MD) for 14 days. Cycloplegic refractive error was measured with an IR Optometer, and the results analysed using power vectors and linear mixed modelling. The in vivo ocular biomechanical response was investigated by raising the IOP to 50 mmHg for one hour in anaesthetised animals. A-scan ultrasound measures of axial length were taken every 10 minutes with raised IOP, and after returning IOP to 15 mmHg. The total cell population (DAPI antibody) and myofibroblast population (&#945;-SMA antibody) was determined in transverse scleral sections from the posterior 100 degrees of each eye. Results: The average relative myopic refractive error induced was -4.06 &#177; 0.35 D, which was mainly the result of vitreous chamber depth (VCD) elongation. This was confirmed by a negative correlation between mean sphere and VCD (R2 = 0.4295). On increasing the IOP the deprived and control eyes showed rapid viscoelastic expansion of the VCD that normal eyes did not show. When the increased IOP was maintained the deprived and control eyes showed lower creep rates than normal eyes. Myofibroblasts were shown to be present in guinea pig sclera, as previously observed in human and tree shrew sclera. On average, approximately 64% of the scleral cells were myofibroblasts. The induction of myopia had minimal effect on the cell populations, except for a decrease in total cell numbers in the 10&#176; region equivalent to the location of scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. Conclusions: Ahigh proportion of scleral cells show contractile potential in the guinea pig. Form deprivation appears to minimally affect cell numbers, except in the region equivalent to scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. However, the in vivo viscoelastic response of the VCD in deprived eyes differs from that in normal eyes, suggesting some factor(s) other than cell number alone has a role in axial length control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of children's asthma in primary care : Are there ethnic differences in care?</field><field name="creator">Crengle, Suzanne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until August 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Primary care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Health services research</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Research</field><field name="subject">Quality of care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321208 Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipiodol fertility enhancement in unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Neil Philip</field><field name="description">Objectives This thesis had the following objectives: 1) To assess the existing evidence base for the effectiveness of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section II, Chapters 4 and 5). 2) To assess current practice and prior beliefs amongst Australasian fertility specialists concerning the role of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section III, Chapter 6). 3) To investigate the possible mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect of the oil soluble contrast medium lipiodol, and specifically whether there is an effect on the endometrium (Section IV, Chapter 7). 4) To generate definitive evidence from a randomised controlled trial for the effectiveness of lipiodol flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section V, Chapters 8 and 9). 5) To evaluate the adoption of lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment into clinical practice (Section VI, Chapter 10).

A prospective observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol flushing in clinical practice to meet objective 5. A clinical hysterosalpingogram procedure to meet objective 4 and 5. Results 1) Eight randomised controlled trials involving 1,971 women were identified and included in the systematic review. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media versus no intervention was associated with a significant increase in the odds of pregnancy (Peto odds ratio [OR] 3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76 to 7.23) but there were no data for live birth. There were no data from RCTs to assess tubal flushing with water-soluble media versus no intervention. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media was associated with a significant increase in the odds of live birth versus tubal flushing with water soluble contrast media (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.11) but the odds of pregnancy showed no significant difference (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.57) and there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes. The addition of oil soluble contrast media to flushing with water soluble contrast media (water plus oil soluble contrast media versus water soluble contrast media alone) showed no significant difference in the odds of live birth (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.77) or pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70). 2) Nineteen Australasian fertility specialists returned survey questionnaires. Eighteen of the 19 specialists believed that lipiodol flushing was more likely to be beneficial than harmful. The most widely held prior belief, reflected in both textual and numerical responses, was that lipiodol was likely to produce a small beneficial response. The credible limits of this belief were compatible with a reasonable fertility benefit, as more than 50% believed that a 1.5-fold increase in pregnancy rate was plausible. The two surveys found that a 1.2-fold or 1.4-fold increase in pregnancy rate was the median expected level of benefit at which clinicians would have been inclined to recommend lipiodol flushing to their patients (combined range 1.1 to 2.3-fold). Individual and collective equipoise was justification to proceed with a definitive randomised controlled trial. 3) The mean number of cluster determinant (CD) 205+ uterine dendritic cells decreased significantly in mice following lipiodol treatment compared to sham treated and saline treated mice, particularly in endometrial and subendometrial tissues. The mean number of CD1+ uterine dendritic cells increased significantly following lipiodol treatment compared to shamtreatment. No significant differences were found in the mean number of total leukocytes or macrophages in the murine uterus between the three treatment groups. 4) Six month follow up of the randomised trial of 158 women showed that lipiodol flushing resulted in a significant increase in pregnancy (48.0% versus 10.8%, RR 4.44, 95% CI 1.61-12.21) and live birth (40.0% versus 10.8%, RR 3.70,.95% CI 1.30-10.50) rates versus no intervention for women with endometriosis (n=62), although there was no significant difference in pregnancy (33.3% versus 20.8%, RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.81-3.16) or live birth (27.1% versus 14.6%, RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.81-4.25) rates for women with unexplained infertility without confirmed endometriosis (n=96). Survival analysis up to 24 months showed a significant benefit in overall pregnancy rate following lipiodol treatment (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.2) for the combined endometriosis and unexplained infertility populations. Amongst women with endometriosis, the benefit in pregnancy rate seen in the first 6 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 5.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 14.2) was not present at 6 to 24 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.1). There was a more consistent effect of lipiodol on fertility throughout the 24 month follow up amongst women with unexplained infertility (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.5). 5) Six month follow up in the observational study of 100 women undergoing lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment in clinical practice showed an overall pregnancy rate 30% and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate 27% six months after the procedure. For women under 40 years old, a 32% pregnancy rate and 25% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with unexplained infertility; a 50% pregnancy rate and 47% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with endometriosis. Of women aged 40 years and older, the pregnancy rate was 13% and the live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was 13%. The pregnancy rates included those occurring after additional interventions, such as intrauterine insemination and in-vitro fertilisation, accounting for 12 of the 30 pregnancies. There were no treatment complications. Conclusions The conclusions of this thesis are as follows. Lipiodol flushing is a simple, inexpensive, effective fertility treatment, which carries a very low chance of complications and no increased chance of multiple pregnancy. Lipiodol treatment is particularly effective in the short term for women with endometriosis who have normal patent fallopian tubes. The fertility benefit from lipiodol treatment lasts longer for women with pure unexplained infertility than for women with endometriosis. The level of benefit from lipiodol treatment for women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility is of sufficient magnitude to convince most fertility specialists surveyed that it is a worthwhile treatment to offer routinely in clinical practice; however complex factors govern the implementation of an innovative fertility treatment. Observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol treatment in clinical practice has provided further evidence of the efficacy and safety of this approach. Uterine dendritic cell changes following lipiodol flushing in mice suggest that the mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect might be an immunobiologic effect on the endometrium that could improve the receptivity of the endometrium (rather than a mechanical tubal flushing effect), although this hypothesis requires further exploration in women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic approximation for target tracking and mine planning optimization</field><field name="creator">Levy, Kim</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, we apply stochastic approximation (SA) to two different problems addressed respectively in Part I and Part II.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stochastic approximation, optimal control, target tracking, mine planning</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precambrian geology of the North Mawson Escarpment area, Prince Charles Mountains, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Corvino, Adrian Felice</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">North Mawson Escarpment, Precambrian geology, East Antarctica, geology</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/4879</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Template synthesis and surface modification of metal oxides</field><field name="creator">Drisko, Glenna Lynn</field><field name="description">Agarose gel was used as a template to prepare zirconium titanium mixed oxide pellets with bimodal porosity.

Disparate explanations and gross generalisations at the macro-level of national economies have hindered the development of a unified theory of trade. While understanding trade at the macro-level is foundational, analysis at the level of the firm is necessary for a comprehensive understanding. Four main strands of explanation have been identified from the literature: competitive advantage and corporate strategy, innovation creation and acquisition, markets and networks, and state and institutional influence. The strands combined form a framework that can explain how and why trade occurs for firms in a particular industry. Innovation leads to competitive advantage which extends a firm&#8217;s spatial influence in the market. Networks interconnect the firm with its external environment. The state&#8217;s role is to facilitate various processes such as amplifying competitive advantage.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water resources development, Australia, economic aspects, international trade</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roosting behaviour of urban microbats: the influence of ectoparasites, roost microclimate and sociality</field><field name="creator">Evans, Lisa Nicole</field><field name="description">Day-roosts are an essential resource for tree-hole roosting microbats (Microchiroptera), providing shelter, protection from predators and an appropriate microclimate for energy conservation and reproduction. Microbats often make use of multiple roosting sites, shifting between roosts frequently. Conservation of tree-hole roosting microbats requires an understanding of roost selection and fidelity to enable the protection of sufficient suitable roosting sites. In Australia, as in other countries, habitat loss, particularly in the form of large hollow-bearing trees, is threatening the survival of microbat populations. In addition, the renewal of natural roosts in Australia is very slow, as trees may need to be 100 years old for hollows to form. Where roosting resources are limited, such as in urbanised areas, batboxes may be used as a substitute. As bat-boxes are also accessible to researchers, these roosting sites can help to improve our understanding of roosting behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microchiroptera, microbat, Gould's wattled bat, White-striped freetail bat, Chalinolobus gouldii, Tadarida australis, ectoparasites, roosting behaviour, sociality, roost microclimate</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional and toxicological studies on New Zealand mutton bird meat (Puffinus griseus)</field><field name="creator">Al-Amer, Saleh Suliaman</field><field name="description">New Zealand mutton bird or t&#299;t&#299; (Puffinus griseus and order procellariiformes) nest in New Zealand during the summer months, migrate to the northern hemisphere during May and return in September. Their eggs are laid during November and December and the chicks are hatched in the following January and February. Large numbers of them are harvested from April to May in New Zealand. They are wild seabirds annually harvested by Maori according to the customary rights agreement set by Treaty of Waitangi.NZ mutton birds also called Sooty Shearwaters are noted for their high proportion of body fat.These birds are interesting since its sole diet is based on krill and other small marine organisms that are potentially rich in n-3 fatty acids and other marine bioactive compounds. The proximate composition, fatty and amino acids and cholesterol content of mutton bird pectoral muscle were determined and compared with other common meat to explore the nutritional value of this New Zealand delicacy. The concentration of twenty two essential and toxic elements including silver (Ag), aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), boron (B), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), sulphur (S), sodium (Na) and cobalt (Co) and zinc (Zn) in mutton bird breast meat (Puffinus griseus) were measured over two years to evaluate its safety for human consumption. Persistent organochlorine, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and their metabolites, and aldrin and lindane were also measured.Twenty bird carcasses were purchased in both 2006 and 2007 from a local source. Meat samples from the pectoral muscle of two carcasses were pooled to generate 10 samples for each year. These were used for trace element analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Trace elements were in the range of 0 to 1.09 mg/kg wet weight for Ag, 0 to 3.32 for Al, 0.17 to 0.79 for As, 0.01 to 0.07 for Cd, 0.03 to 0.15 for Cr, 3.56 to 4.88 for Cu, 0 to 0.15 for Hg, 0.22 to 0.50 for Mn, 0 to 0.09 for Pb, 0.66 to 1.18 for Se and 11.49 to 23.70 for Zn. In 2006, Ag, Al, Mn and Zn concentrations were significantly higher but Pb and Hg concentrations significantly lower compared to the 2007 samples (P &lt; 0.05). Apart from one sample in 2006, all the samples were below the published maximum level for concern. However, our preliminary data indicated that the higher level of Cd and other metals in the skin of mutton bird may compromise the overall safety to humans consuming the skin of mutton birds. It is suggested that the evaluation of the metals in different parts and/or the whole mutton bird at different seasons is required to assure complete safety to the consumers.Furthermore, the nutritional value of mutton bird meat was studied over two harvesting seasons (2006 and 2007) to investigate the impact of seasonal variation. The moisture and carbohydrates contents ranged between 54.0 to 55.0 % and 2.8 to 3.0 %, respectively, and no seasonal effects were evident in these components. The values for fat and ash contents were higher and the protein content lower for birds harvested in 2007 compared with the 2006 values which ranged from 11.8 to 13.0, 10.3 to 11.7, and 20.3 to 18.5 % for fat, ash and protein content respectively. The major amino acids in mutton bird pectoral muscle were glutamate, aspartate, lysine, leucine, and arginine. Higher lysine concentrations and lower proline, cystein and methionine were found in mutton birds compared with the literature values for beef, lamb and pork. The essential amino acid content in mutton bird (43.8 and 44.9 % in 2006 and 2007, respectively) was slightly higher than those found in beef and lamb meats (42-43%).The major fatty acids detected were palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic and isomers (C18:1), eicosenoic (C20:1), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6), icosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C 20:5) and these accounted for approximately 77% of the fatty acids. The &#61559;3/6 ratio of fats from pectoral muscle was 1.3. The cholesterol concentration varied slightly in the two years with 184.4&#177;37.37and 134.4&#177;25.55mg/100 g fresh weight for 2007 and 2008 respectively. Mutton bird was shown to contain significantly higher cholesterol content (134.4-184.4) than other common meat such as chicken (80.3-88.9), lamb (62.3), fish (52.79) and beef (51.97). Overall, the nutritional value of mutton bird muscle was similar to or superior to the traditionally protein sources such as seafood and red meat. Annual variations existed in the composition of Mutton bird pectoral muscle but this is not of nutritional consequence but might be a useful indicator for ecological events such as feed availability and other environmental issues. Mutton bird seems to be a good source of essential minerals, Zn and Fe compared with other traditional meats source. Mutton bird meat is nutritionally as good as the major sources of red or white meats. It may even have advantages over the other common meats (beef, lamb, fish and chicken) due to its high protein and monounsaturated fatty acids (omega n-3 and n-6) content. However, its high cholesterol content may represent a risk factor for some people.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mutton bird</field><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">minerals</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="subject">amino acids</field><field name="subject">cholesterol</field><field name="subject">seasonal variation breast meat</field><field name="subject">nutrition and toxicology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences::320504 Toxicology (incl. clinical toxicology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving semiring constraint satisfaction problems</field><field name="creator">Leenen, Louise</field><field name="description">The Semiring Constraint Satisfaction Problem (SCSP) framework is a popular approach for the representation of partial constraint satisfaction problems. Considerable research has been done in solving SCSPs, but limited work has been done in building general SCSP solvers. In this thesis, we present various methods to solve SCSPs. We first consider how a SCSP might be relaxed: we relax individual constraints until an acceptable solution can be obtained. A second semiring is used to define a measure of difference between the original problem and the relaxed problem. This research was first presented at the International Workshop on Preferences and Soft Constraints at CP-2005 [40], and an extended version of the paper has been published in the Information Processing Letters journal [41].We then show how the two semirings of a relaxed SCSP can be combined into a single semiring structure. This combined semiring structure will make it possible to use existing tools for solving SCSPs to solve Combined SCSPs. This work appears in Leenen et al. [42].The remainder of this thesis focusses on algorithms to solve SCSPs. A significant amount of work has been devoted to solving the well-known maximum satisfiability problem (Max SAT) [1, 63] and the related Weighted M ax -SAT problem. This prompted us to modify the methods for solving Max-SAT, into methods for solving SCSPs. We show how to translate a SCSP into a variant of the Weighted Max &#8211;SAT Problem, which we call a Weighted Semiring Max -SAT problem, and then present a local search algorithm that is a modification of the GSAT algorithm for solving Max -SAT. This work appears in Leenen et al. [38].Finally, we extend well-known algorithms for maximal constraint satisfaction into SCSP algorithms. We present a branch and bound algorithm, a backjumping algorithm, and a forward checking algorithm. Our branch and bound algorithm performs significantly better than CONFLEX [17], a well-known fuzzy CSP solver. The branch and bound algorithm has been presented in Leenen et al. [38]. The forward checking and backjumping algorithms perform better than the branch and bound algorithm on harder problems. This work appears Leenen et al.

We assume a continuous model for which the atoms are assumed to be smeared across the surface of the molecule, so that the pairwise molecular energy can be approximated by performing surface integrals. The spiral path of the atom is found to be stable, but the spiral path of the C60 fullerene is shown to only exist for a few pico seconds. Next, we investigate the motion of a nano tippe top spinning on the interior of a single-walled carbon nanotube in the presence of a variable magnetic field. Unlike the classical tippe top, the nanoscale tippe top does not flip over since the gravitational effect is insignificant at the nanoscale. After the precession, if we apply an opposite retarding magnetic force at the contact point, then the molecule will return to its original standing up position. We next investigate some nanoscale orbiting systems, and in particular, we study an atom and a C60 fullerene orbiting around a single infinitely long carbon nanotube and a C60 fullerene orbiting around a C1500 fullerene. We find that the circular orbiting frequencies of the proposed nano systems are in the gigahertz range and the classification of their orbiting paths are determined numerically.For the axial buckling of carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods, we investigate the buckling behavior of doubly clamped multi-walled carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods as nano-electromechanical systems. We incorporate the bending curvature of the tube into the elastic energy and determine the nanotube&#8217;s maximum displacement for all bending regimes. We find that while the approximate solution (without curvature) underestimates the maximum displacement of the buckled carbon nanotube in the weak bending regime, our numerical solution provides an entirely different prediction in comparison to the approximate solution in the strong bending regime. Furthermore, we derive an instability condition for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods under an axial load by taking into account the van der Waals forces between molecules. We observe that the critical force derived from the axial buckling stability criterion decreases as a result of the molecular interactions between adjacent layers of the nanotubes and the molecular interactions between the embedded fullerenes and the inner carbon nanotube. The worm-like chain model arises as a model for stretched semi-flexible molecules and for its applications to molecular stretching in the extracellular matrix, we adopt a variational principle to examine the model and then we utilize the model to describe anionic glycosaminoglycan between collagens. The worm-like chain model has been proposed assuming that each monomer resists the bending force. We determine a force-extension formula for the worm-like chain model analytically, and find that our formula suggests new terms such as the free energy and the cut-off force for a molecule. In addition, we predict two possible phase changes for a stretched molecule, and show theoretically that a molecule must undergo two phase changes when they are stretched beyond their total contour lengths. Furthermore, we adopt the worm-like chain model to describe the mechanical properties of a collagen pair in the connective tissue extracellular matrix. We find that the growth of fibrils is intimately related to the maximum length of the anionic glycosaminoglycan and the relative displacement of two adjacent fibrils.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mythological state and its empire</field><field name="creator">Grant, David John, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">legitimate because it is not the persistence of a secularised theological concept. Although it reoccupied mirror-image pre-Enlightenment questions, say regarding absolutism, it is not first concerned with such categories as ???sovereignty, raison d???etat, will, decision, friend-enemy??? but with ???contract, consent, liberty, law and rights???. However, in Work on Myth, he proposes that man is, and has always been, a maker of mythological magnitudes, of which there can be argued to be an archetypal form. These magnitudes are so fearsome as to allow man to convert his existential fear into fear of an entity the fate of which he can gradually bring into his own hands. In this way, there is the promise of the elimination of existential fear and of the experience of sympathetic conditions of existence. Blumenberg does not address political issues, such as the nature of the State. However, if the State can be shown to be such a magnitude and therefore a political realisation of such an archetype, then it is mythological and so is not modern, even if it is legitimate. It then needs to be criticised to allow the introduction of a radical notion of Enlightenment. The effect of such criticisms would be the replacement of the notions of fear and sympathy with that of self-responsibility as the first interest of the State. Selfresponsibility would need to be promoted progressively. It would require a reconfigured State the prime purpose of which is the promotion of respect and self-reliance of individuals. Its first concern would therefore not be the elimination of fear, which would be understood as unable to be eliminated, nor the creation by it of sympathetic conditions of existence, which would be better a matter for properly prepared and supported, selfreliant individuals. The debate then would be around this axis, where contingency is accepted and managed, not the mythological axis of liberalism and republicanism which has dominated modern political theory since Hobbes. This thesis is first an exploration of the viability of the mythological idea of the State, whether the State is a political realisation of the archetypal myth. It does this through an examination of such thinkers in the political tradition as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, Rawls and Pettit. The conclusion of this examination is, in sum, that the idea of the State since Hobbes has been, and remains, mythological since it shows all the key characteristics of a mythological entity and the arguments for it have mythological presumptions. It is still first concerned with the fear/sympathy nexus and the debates of the political tradition from Hobbes to Pettit have been carried out around that axis. Further, this is argued to be an arrangement which promotes dominant interests rather than widespread participation of non-autonomous, self-responsible individuals. But if this notion of the State as a progressively refined and dispersed mythological entity is viable, it cannot have existed only in the minds of those in the political theoretical tradition. We should expect to see evidence of it in the beliefs and practices of individual  men and women. It must have been not just a political realisation of the mythological State as an idea, but an embodied notion. This thesis is also an exploration of the evidence for that embodiment. It does this by looking at Elias??? analysis of the civilising process in the Middle Ages, at Foucault???s analysis of the emergence and proliferation of the disciplines and the art of government from the 17th century and at the dispersal of the myth through cultural imperialism in the 18th century. The conclusions of these analyses are reinforced by the social ontology of Wittgenstein. Further argument for this embodiment is presented regarding both the common notion of citizenship and the perception of other cultures, that each manifest mythological characteristics. Such embodied practices can be seen as strategies promoted through the State by dominant interests, the purpose of which are the claims to generally eliminate fear and create sympathetic conditions of existence. This embodiment reinforces the initial argument that the idea of the State did emerge and has been established and gradually refined as mythological. In essence and in large part, this is a genealogy of post-Hobbesian political society as mythological. That is, as the political realisation of the archetypal mythological form and its embodiment in the material practice of individuals. The explanatory value of this way of perceiving the State is then demonstrated by its application to the complex conditions of the destruction of traditional Aboriginal culture by the colonising and civilising British, that is the dispersal of the mythological State as empire. From this, it is argued that the mythological understanding of the State is more illuminating that other approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State, The</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the critical design parameters for reuse</field><field name="creator">Ibbotson, Scott, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Reuse of components as opposed to material recovery, recycling or disposal has been identified as one of the most efficient EOL strategies for products. The concept behind reuse is that some components and subassemblies have a design life that exceeds the life of the product itself. In order for reuse to be successfully implemented as an EOL strategy, a designer needs to incorporate into a product a philosophy of Design for Reuse (DfRe) at the early design stage. Reliable methods to assess the remaining life of used components based on a products usage life are also required. Furthermore, current industry practices and literature advocate that there is no methodology to decide which parameters need to be redesigned so as to change the life of a selected component to a desired level. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology to assess the reuse potential of product groups based on component failure mechanisms and their associated critical lifetime prediction design parameters. Utilising these clustered groups mathematical models were then developed to establish the useful life of the components for each clustered group. Finally, a means of equating useful life to design life was established and the relationship between, the failure mechanisms, critical lifetime prediction design parameters and design life were represented in graphical format. In order to achieve the proposed objective, Cluster analysis, in particular Group Technology (GT) and Hierarchical clustering were employed to group components with similar failure mechanisms. Following this, multiple linear regression was used to establish mathematical models based on condition monitoring data for each of the clustered groups and their related critical lifetime prediction design parameters. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the mathematical models, in order to produce graphical relations between the useful life and design parameters of a product.  The validity of the suggested methodology was tested on electric motors and a gearbox as both these components have demonstrated great reuse potential. The results demonstrate that the methodology can assist designers in estimating the design life and associated design parameters with great accuracy, and subsequently aiding in a stratagem for reuse.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycled products</field><field name="subject">Spare parts</field><field name="subject">Salvage (Waste, etc.) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem frames approach to strategic requirements for web services</field><field name="creator">Jha, Anju, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web Services can be seen from two views ? one that it is a purely technological advance and the other that it is a capability that an organisation can deploy to meet a business objective. Much has been said about the first view but not much has been said about the second view. The underlying premise of this research is that in the context of an ever-increasing competitive environment, an organisation needs to take into account these important aspects: What is the business strategy of the organisation, which adopts Web Services? Does the IT align with the business strategy of the organisation? The aim of this research is to capture and describe business-IT problems in the context of strategic requirements and Web Services. As a means to align a Web Services initiative with business strategy, we propose a Requirements Engineering framework to capture the business objectives of an organisation from strategy to implementation. The methodology that we propose provides a roadmap from business strategy, to the strategic objectives to implementation in four dimensions: innovation, customer relationship management, infrastructure management and financials. The proposed framework extends the e-Business Modelling Ontology (eBMO) of Pigneur and Osterwalder by applying Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems to understand the strategic objectives and the business context.  We have presented 2 examples as proof of concept. We have experimented with our methodology on Amazon.com and Dell.com ?cases developed from the literature? as these organisations are aggressively pursuing Web Services as a part of their IT and business strategy. We use the Problem Frames approach to capture the business objectives and the problem context of an organisation deploying Web Services and to create a strategic alignment between the business strategy and the information technology. The approach presented in this thesis is used to understand Amazon and Dell?s strategy and strategic objectives. It was possible to capture strategic objectives and the strategic context through combination of the eBMO and Progression of Problems. It was also possible to trace this to Web Services requirement description through application of Problem Frames. The framework combines with Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems at the strategic level and applies Problem Frames at the operational level. It takes the problem-oriented view of the whole process, but does not apply Problem Frames throughout, at least not in their original formulation by Jackson.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Business strategy series.</field><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and investigation of local optima in aerospace structural design</field><field name="creator">Shi, Jianming, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research into the causes of local optima when optimization algorithms are applied to aerospace structural design. A thorough understanding of local optima will enable the engineers to select the algorithm for optimization or to guide the optimization to ensure either global optima or near optimal solutions are achieved. Therefore, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted and several illustrative examples have been identified to help fully understand the cause and importance of local optima. The first application involved the design of the internal structure of a simplified wing spoiler. MSC.NASTRAN was used to optimize each discretized location of an additional rib with the aid of a Patran Command Language (PCL) algorithm. The objective function of minimum weight was approximated as a multimodal function in a 2D smooth curve where the local and global optima were identified. The theory of continuous rectangular plates was used to explain the phenomena. The second problem considered buckling of a wing rib. A PCL code was written to obtain the rib buckling factors as the position of the center of a square cutout was varied within a constrained area. The rib linear buckling factor versus the centre position O(X, Y) of the square cutout was plotted in a 3D surface contour plot. Load path theory and relevant plate buckling theories were used to explain the local and global maxima identified. The final example considered the maximization of the buckling load of a simply supported composite laminated plate under in-plane loading. A conventional Genetic Algorithm was used to examine the local and global optima of the critical buckling load factor. Many local and global optima were identified and explained and many near-optimal solutions were found in a single run. A significant understanding of local optima in aerospace structural design with the optimal utilization of available software and the appropriate selection of optimization algorithms has been achieved. Further work could either include implementing the proposed global optimization strategies or include implementing rapid methods for identifying multiple local optima.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerospace engineering</field><field name="subject">structural -- computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the evolutionary sequence of massive star formation</field><field name="creator">Hill, Tracey Lee, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Massive stars form in the dense optically thick cores of molecular clouds throughout the Galaxy. They actively participate in the heating of these molecular clouds and also in enriching the interstellar medium with heavy elements. Stellar winds may contribute to change the original cloud structure by in uencing nearby low mass star formation, or even by triggering the formation of new stars. Despite the fact that massive star formation is manifest throughout the Galaxy, the mechanisms involved in their formation are poorly understood. The coincidence of methanol masers and ultracompact (UC) HII regions with young massive stars, indicates their eectiveness in tracing the earliest stages of high-mass stellar evolution. This thesis concentrates on a multiwavelength study of massive star formation regions. The cornerstone of this thesis is a (sub)millimetre study of methanol maser and UC HII sources associated with massive star formation regions. The 15m Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST) and the 15m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) were used to survey continuum emission at 1.2mm and 450 &amp; 850 m, respectively. The 1.2-mm continuum emission observations were undertaken with the SEST IMaging Bolometer Array (SIMBA) toward star-forming complexes associated with methanol maser and/or radio continuum sources. This survey detected emission toward all of the methanol maser and UC HII regions targeted, and revealed evidence of a handful of these tracers lying within the elds mapped without millimetre continuum emission. Interestingly, the SIMBA survey also revealed evidence of sources devoid of traditional star formation tracers (methanol/OH maser, UC HII regions, IRAS sources), detected solely from their millimetre continuum emission. These `mm-only' sources prompted a follow-up study with the JCMT. The 450 and 850m observations  of mm-only cores discovered in the SIMBA survey, utilised the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the JCMT, which detected submillimetre continuum emission toward 97 per cent of sources targeted. The SCUBA instrument also resolved a number of SIMBA sources into multiple components, and found evidence of submillimetre sources devoid of SIMBA emission. The (sub)millimetre data from the SIMBA and SCUBA surveys enabled study of the dust properties of the cores, and in particular the dust grain emissivity index , which is of order 2 for the sample. Spectral energy distribution (SED) diagrams were drawn for the SIMBA sources, employing MSX and IRAS data where possible. Eight parameters are reported for each of the sources in the sample: luminosity, temperature, mass, H2 number density (nH2 ), surface density (), radius, distance and luminosity-tomass ratio (L/M). These data show that the mm-only cores are of comparable mass to sources harbouring a methanol maser and/or radio continuum source, but are smaller, cooler, less luminous, with smaller luminosity-to-mass ratios, than these sources. This prompts the suggestion that the mm-only core is an example of the earliest stages of massive star formation prior to the onset of methanol maser emission. The mm-only sample was identied as comprising two populations, which are distinguished by temperature. The cool-mm sources are distinct from the warm-mm sources as well as from those sources with a methanol maser and/or a radio continuum source for all parameters tested but for the mass and in some instances the radius. The warm-mm on the other hand are similar to those sources with a methanol maser site and/or an UC HII region for all parameters tested. The cool-mm sources are less luminous, with lower luminosity-to-mass ratios, as well as higher H2 number and surface densities. This prompts hypotheses to be drawn regarding the nature of these two mm-only populations. The warm-mm sources are possible precursors to the methanol maser and are thus indicative of the earliest stages of massive star formation, whilst the cool-mm sources are possible examples of `failed' cores that will remain starless. It is, however, not yet clear which of these mm-only populations are forming massive stars and further work to test these hypotheses is required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering polishness: articulating and maintaining identity through turbulent times</field><field name="creator">Drozdzewski, Danielle, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis details the maintenance of Polish identities through acts of memory: the  (re)production, transmission and reception of Polish cultural practices.  The                 (re)productions and transmissions of Polish identity formations, and the acts of remembrance, are multifarious by nature, and I have examined them in two distinctly different settings ?? in public spheres in Poland, and in the private realms of Australian Polish diaspora.  In this thesis, these research settings have been conceptualised as the conduits through which Polish identities are maintained.  Polish identity is theorised using a constructivist approach; Polish identities are therefore positioned historically and geographically.  Their performances are fluid: they move through time and across spaces.  The active maintenance of Polish identity developed as a result of foreign occupations.  The partitioning of Poland by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires lasted 123 years.  From 1795 to 1918 the Polish nation was expunged.  Following a brief period of independence between World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII), Poland was again occupied by Nazi and Soviet regimes during WWII (1939-1945).  The Soviet occupation continued after WWII with the Soviet-supported Polish government that lasted until 1989.  Under occupation ?? particularly during WWII ?? Poland suffered events that have been indelibly imprinted within Polish cultural memory.  The macabre nature of this era included the incursion of hegemonic regimes on political and everyday social life, as well as the atrocities for which it is well known.  An important outcome of these occupations has been the division of discourses of Polishness, and their remembrances, into distinctly public and private spheres.  These periods of foreign occupation brought various attempts to suppress and eliminate Polishness: the cultures and identifications of Polish people.  Suppression particularly occurred in public spheres through the prohibition of the Polish language, and by investing the public memory landscape with ideologies that represented the new regimes.  By repressing public commemorations of Polish cultural narratives, a new history was written at the expense of the Polish experience.  There have been two primary responses to these repressions of Polishness.  These responses initially developed during the partitioned period to ensure that Polish language and cultural practices were maintained.  First, a narrative and tradition of resistance emerged in reaction to the Russian, Prussian and Austrian partitions.  It was enacted through military participation in insurrections and through the production of patriotic Romantic Era cultural artefacts, both of which strengthened linkages to the Polish Catholic faith.  Second, Polish cultural practices and language were safeguarded in the private spheres of home.  It was in private settings, in Poland and within the diaspora in Australia, that memories and experiences of occupation were passed on and through generations.  In Poland, such narratives were often maintained in resistance to those imposed by foreign occupiers and because of the inability to commemorate events of Poland??s macabre past in public.  In Australia, identity maintenance has occurred to resist the dissolution of Polishness in a diasporic and multicultural environment.  This thesis demonstrates the utility of studying cultural memories as a means of understanding how identity maintenance can occur in the face of adversities, such as the multiple foreign occupations that occurred in Poland, and in diaspora.  Moreover, it exemplifies the diverse paths of identity maintenance in different contexts.  This thesis shows that despite the distinctive character of both Polish public and private spheres, Polish identities have been informed, shaped and maintained through culturally-enacted memory (re)production.  This process is exhibited in the present ?? in Poland and through the diaspora ?? and it occurred despite the repressive aims of various foreign occupiers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polishness</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Polish -- Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite horizon robust state estimation for uncertain finite-alphabet hidden Markov models</field><field name="creator">Xie, Li, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we consider a robust state estimation problem for discrete-time, homogeneous, first-order, finite-state finite-alphabet hidden Markov models (HMMs). Based on Kolmogorov's Theorem on the existence of a process, we first present the Kolmogorov model for the HMMs under consideration. A new change of measure is introduced. The statistical properties of the Kolmogorov representation of an HMM are discussed on the canonical probability space. A special Kolmogorov measure is constructed. Meanwhile, the ergodicity of two expanded Markov chains is investigated.  In order to describe the uncertainty of HMMs, we study probability distance problems based on the Kolmogorov model of HMMs. Using a change of measure technique, the relative entropy and the relative entropy rate as probability distances between HMMs, are given in terms of the HMM parameters. Also, we obtain a new expression for a probability distance considered in the existing literature such that we can use an information state method to calculate it.  Furthermore, we introduce regular conditional relative entropy as an a posteriori probability distance to measure the discrepancy between HMMs when a realized observation sequence is given. A representation of the regular conditional relative entropy is derived based on the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Then a recursion for the regular conditional relative entropy is obtained using an information state method.  Meanwhile, the well-known duality relationship between free energy and relative entropy is extended to the case of regular conditional relative entropy given a sub-[special character]-algebra. Finally, regular conditional relative entropy constraints are defined based on the study of the probability distance problem. Using a Lagrange multiplier technique and the duality relationship for regular conditional relative entropy, a finite horizon robust state estimator for HMMs with regular conditional relative entropy constraints is derived. A complete characterization of the solution to the robust state estimation problem is also presented.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">hidden Markov models (HMM)</field><field name="subject">Kolmogorov</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">posteriori</field><field name="subject">probability</field><field name="subject">robust state estimator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of knitting and preforming parameters on mechanical properties of weft knitted glass/epoxy composites</field><field name="creator">Tran, Luu, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Weft knitted composites have a very complex reinforcement structure which affects their mechanical behaviour.

The mechanism underlying the relationship between the INSR and increased cardiovascular risk is controversial. We postulated that perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system [RAS] and endothelium-derived NO may be implicated in the development of early vascular changes in the INSR.  Repeated measurements of arterial stiffness [using digital photoplethysmography] and haemodynamic parameters in response to vasoactive medications were used to demonstrate the functional expression of angiotensin II [Ang II] receptors and NO synthase [NOS].  Ang II acts via two main receptor sub-types: the Ang II type 1 [AT1] and Ang II type 2 [AT2] receptors. The AT1 receptor is central to the development of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. The role of AT2 receptors in humans is controversial but is postulated to counter-act AT1 receptor mediated effects in diseased vascular beds. We demonstrated increased AT1 and AT2 receptor-mediated effects in small to medium-sized arteries of subjects with early INSR [Chapter 6].  In addition, functional expression of AT2 receptors in adult insulin resistant humans [Chapter 5], but not in healthy volunteers [Chapter 4] was demonstrated. AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with early INSR resulted in improvements in vascular function, with a consequent functional down-regulation of AT2 receptors [Chapter 7].  Functional NOS expression was demonstrated to be increased in subjects with early INSR compared with healthy controls [Chapter 6]. This was postulated to be a homeostatic response to counteract early vascular changes in subjects with early INSR. AT1 receptor blockade in these subjects reduced functional NOS expression [Chapter 8].  In conclusion, patients with early INSR represent a model of early disease where early intervention may be able to reverse the process incited by the initial exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Early vascular changes in these individuals are mediated at least in part, by increased AT1 receptor activity and/or expression, and may be detected by changes in arterial stiffness indices and non-invasive vascular reactivity studies. There is a compensatory increase in AT2 receptor and NOS expression/activity to counter-act these vascular changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial stiffness.</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Angiotensin receptors.</field><field name="subject">AT1 receptor.</field><field name="subject">AT2 receptor.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of rainfall and its importance towards robust catchment simulation, within a hydroinformatic environment</field><field name="creator">Umakhanthan, Kanagaratnam, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rainfall is a natural process, which has a high degree of variability in both space and time. Information on the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall plays an important role in the process of surface runoff generation. Hence it is important for a variety of applications in hydrology and water resources management. The spatial variability of rainfall can be substantial even for very small catchments and an important factor in the reliability of rainfall-runoff simulations. Catchments in urban areas usually are small, and the management problems often require the numerical simulation of catchment processes and hence the need to consider the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall. A need exists, therefore, to analyse the sensitivity of rainfall-runoff behaviour of catchment modelling systems (CMS) to imperfect knowledge of rainfall input, in order to judge whether or not they are reliable and robust, especially if they are to be used for operational purposes. Development of a methodology for identification of storm events according to the degree of heterogeneity in space and time and thence development of a detailed spatial and temporal rainfall model within a hydroinformatic environment utilising real-time data has been the focus of this project. The improvement in runoff prediction accuracy and hence the importance of the rainfall input model in runoff prediction is then demonstrated through the application of a CMS for differing variability of real storm events to catchments with differing orders of scale. The study identified both spatial and temporal semi-variograms, which were produced by plotting the semi-variance of gauge records in space and time against distance and time respectively. These semi-variograms were utilised in introducing estimators to measure the degree of heterogeneity of each individual storm events in their space and time scale. Also, the proposed estimators use ground based gauge records of the real storm events and do not rely on delicate meteorological interpretations. As the results of the investigation on the developed semi-variogram approach, real storm events were categorised as being High Spatial-High Temporal (HS-HT); High Spatial-Low Temporal; (HS-LT); Low Spatial-High Temporal (LS-HT); and Low Spatial-Low Temporal variability.A comparatively detailed rainfall distribution model in space and time was developed within the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The enhanced rainfall representation in both space and time scale is made feasible in the study by the aid of the powerful spatial analytic capability of GIS. The basis of this rainfall model is an extension of the rainfall model developed by Luk and Ball (1998) through a temporal discretisation of the storm event. From this model, improved estimates of the spatially distributed with smaller time steps hyetographs suited for especially the urban catchments could be obtained. The importance of the detailed space-time rainfall model in improving the robustness of runoff prediction of CMS was investigated by comparing error parameters for predictions from CMS using alternate rainfall models, for various degrees of spatiotemporal heterogeneity events. Also it is appropriate to investigate whether the degree of this improvement to be dependent on the variability of the storm event which is assessed by the adopted semi-variogram approach. From the investigations made, it was found that the spline surface rainfall model, which considered the spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall in greater detail than the Thiessen rainfall model resulted in predicted hydrographs that more closely duplicated the recorded hydrograph for the same parameter set. The degree of this improvement in the predicted hydrograph was found to be dependent on the spatial and temporal variability of the storm event as measured by the proposed semi-variogram approach for assessing this feature of a storm event. The analysis is based on forty real events recorded from the Centennial Park Catchment (1.3km2) and the Upper Parramatta River Catchment (110km2) in Sydney, Australia. These two case study catchments were selected to ensure that catchment scale effects were incorporated in the conclusions developed during the study.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Watershed management -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Runoff -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Savings and recovery after extinction of a classically conditioned response in the rabbit</field><field name="creator">Weidemann, Gabrielle, School Of Psychology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis examined post-extinction recovery phenomena following classical conditioning in the rabbit. The first series of experiments examined the rate of reacquisition to the original conditioned stimulus (CS) and to a cross-modal CS following various amounts of extinction. In both the rabbit nictitating membrane (NM) preparation and rabbit heart rate (HR) conditioning, there was a graded reduction in the rate of reacquisition as a direct function of the number of extinction trials. In the rabbit NM preparation, there was also a graded reduction in the rate of acquisition to a cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light). However, concurrent recovery of responding to the original, extinguished stimulus (CSA, e.g., tone) during training with a novel, cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light), appeared uniformly robust even following extensive extinction. The second series of experiments examined the conditions necessary for concurrent recovery to occur in the rabbit NM preparation. The introduction of CSB-US pairings resulted in strong recovery of responding to CSA, while the reintroduction of the US alone failed to result in any discernable reinstatement of responding to CSA. Concurrent recovery was specific to the trained and extinguished CSA, with virtually no generalized responding to a novel cross-modal test stimulus (CSC). However, pretraining with CSB-US pairings significantly reduced the amount of recovery to CSA during subsequent CSB???US pairings. The third series of experiments revealed that concurrent recovery was specific to the extinguished stimulus (CSA) with only moderate generalization to other familiar but untrained stimuli in the same modality as CSA. Together these results indicate that concurrent recovery is not primarily the result of the unmasking of the original CSA-US association. Rather, concurrent recovery appears to be at least partially the result of learning-dependent generalization. However, in order for responding to CSB, to generalize to CSA, CSA must have been paired with the same US which is subsequently paired with CSB. Thus, the CSA-US association must be partially intact for concurrent recovery to occur. A layered network model with multiple hidden units is able to simulate rapid reacquisition, facilitated cross-modal acquisition and concurrent recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conditioned response</field><field name="subject">Classical conditioning</field><field name="subject">Rabbits</field><field name="subject">Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walking interventions to prevent coronary heart disease in Australia - quantifying effect size, dose-response and cost reductions</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Henry , Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single largest cause of death in Australia. Lack of physical activity is a primary risk factor for CHD.  The thesis aimed to quantify the efficacy of walking in reducing CHD risk. Meta-analyses were performed for the quantification with the application of random-effect meta-regression models.  The thesis also aimed to quantify reductions in CHD-related direct healthcare costs, productivity loss and disease burden resulting from walking interventions in Australia, using the population attributable fraction model, the work and leisure models, and the consumer surplus model.  Economic evaluations were also conducted to estimate CHD-related productivity loss using  the human capital and the friction methods. The results indicated that 30 minutes of normal walking a day for 5-7 days a week compared to physical inactivity reduced CHD risk by 24%. There existed a dose-response relationship between walking and CHD risk reduction. An increment of approximately 30 minutes of normal walking a day for 5 days a week reduced CHD risk by 19%. The annual productivity loss resulting from CHD was estimated at AU$1.79 billion based on the human capital method and AU$25.05 million under the friction method. 30 minutes of normal walking a day for 5-7 days a week by the country???s ???sufficient??? walking population was shown to generate an estimated $126.73 million in net direct healthcare savings annually. The net economic savings could increase to AU$419.9 million if the whole inactive population engaged in ???sufficient??? walking. The study also found that 30 minutes of normal walking a day for 5-7 days a week reduced the burden of CHD by an estimated 25,065 DALYs and the productivity loss by AU$162.65 million annually under the leisure model. If the whole inactive population engaged in such walking, the total disease burden and productivity loss could be reduced by approximately one third. The findings present epidemiological and economic evidence in support of the national physical activity guidelines, which encourage the general public to engage in moderate physical activity including walking for a minimum of 30 minutes a day for 5-7 days a week.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cost savings</field><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">Economic evaluation</field><field name="subject">Productivity loss</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">CHD prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential of sphingolipid depletion for the treatment of atherosclerosis</field><field name="creator">Glaros, Elias Nicholas, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sphingolipids have been implicated as potential atherogenic lipids. Inhibition of hepatic serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) reduces plasma sphingomyelin (SM) levels leading to a reduction of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (apoE-/-) mice. In my thesis I have investigated the possibility that the reduced atherosclerosis resulting from SPT inhibition is associated with decreases in plasma glycosphingolipids (GSL). Furthermore, I examined whether SPT inhibition can lead to regression of atherosclerotic lesions. This thesis shows the SPT inhibitor myriocin inhibits atherosclerosis in apoE-/- mice fed a high fat diet. Lesion inhibition was most pronounced at the aortic arch and distal sites of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. There was also a trend towards a reduction in lesion area at the aortic root. Myriocin treatment resulted in significant reductions in both plasma SM and GSL concentrations. Moreover, it was demonstrated that myriocin significantly inhibited the progression of established atherosclerosis. Although the inhibition of lesion progression was observed mainly in the distal regions of the aorta, regression of lesion size was not detected. In addition, this thesis demonstrated for the first time that selective inhibition of GSL synthesis by the GSL synthesis inhibitor, d-threo-1- ethylendioxyphenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-propanol (EtDO-P4) had no significant impact on lesion area in apoE-deficient mice. Thus, despite the previously observed positive correlations between plasma and aortic GSL concentrations and the development of atherosclerosis, this thesis indicates that inhibition of GSL synthesis does not inhibit atherosclerosis in vivo. In other studies we assessed the possibility that myriocin may also be acting to increase hepatic apoA-I production via the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. To address this, HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with myriocin. This significantly increased apoA-I mRNA, and protein levels. It also increased apoA-I secrection, and decreased ERK phosphorylation. These in vitro data indicate that ERK phosphorylation plays a role in modulating apoA-I expression, and that myriocin???s mechanism of action is linked to this pathway. Overall, this thesis has expanded the current literature regarding the role of sphingolipid synthesis inhibition and atherosclerosis.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Sphingolipids</field><field name="subject">Glycosphingolipids</field><field name="subject">Myriocin</field><field name="subject">Apolipoprotein-E</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New perspectives on employer branding: an empirical investigation of scope, nature and success drivers</field><field name="creator">Moroko, Lara , Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Employer branding is a strategic activity that has grown in popularity over the past two decades. Much progress has been made in investigating aspects of employer branding; however, many facets of the process, as it has been conceptualised in the research literature, remain empirically unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to get a deeper, more grounded understanding of employer branding based on an investigation of employer branding processes in practice. Four papers are presented, each providing a new perspective. In the first paper, industry experts??? perceptions of the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful employer brands are used to arrive at a typology of employer branding success. The typology is managerially relevant, providing a means by which firms may assess their employer branding success qualitatively and quantitatively (based on metrics commonly used in practice). Further, theoretical contributions are made by establishing employer branding as a context distinct from corporate and consumer branding, and by providing a basis for assessing variance between employer brands.  In the second and third papers, the mechanisms that shape and perpetuate employer brands are explored. Individual (employee) and firm-related mechanisms drawn from the literature are empirically validated in the second paper using qualitative within-case analysis of four employer brands. The firms are from a broad range of industries and are characteristically successful (a pharmaceuticals and a financial services firm) and unsuccessful (a transport firm and a semi-government public utility). The case analysis results in the discovery of additional mechanisms relating to industry-level factors, not previously documented. These findings are built on in the third paper, where cross-case analysis of the same firms is used to establish a set of conditions that support or erode employer branding success. Importantly, theory perspectives outside the traditional domain of marketing (i.e., human resources, organisational behaviour and strategy) are shown to be critical for understanding the process in practice. A taxonomy of generic market segmentation types is used in the fourth paper to investigate the application of market segmentation to employer branding. Market segmentation is shown to provide a useful link between employer branding and broader strategic planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employee attraction</field><field name="subject">Employer Brand</field><field name="subject">Employer Branding</field><field name="subject">Employer attractiveness</field><field name="subject">Brand strategy</field><field name="subject">Employee retention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of seam dip on the application of the longwall top coal caving method for inclined thick seams</field><field name="creator">Dao, Hong Quang, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of research into the potential of underground mining methods applicable to inclined thick seams (thickness greater than 3.5m, and seam dip of 15 - 35 degree) in the Quangninh coalfield, Vietnam. The primary objectives of this research are to investigate the most suitable underground methods applicable to inclined thick seams in the Quangninh coalfield and to improve understanding of the operational and geotechnical issues associated with the application of chosen methods in thick seams with steeply dipping conditions.  From a risk and operational assessment, the Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) method is considered most appropriate for inclined thick seams under the current mining conditions in Vietnam. The LTCC method offers great potential for the efficient extraction of thick seams by caving coal from the upper section during the mining of the lower section. This significantly reduces the development cost per tonne. Compared to High reach Single Pass Longwalling, the LTCC method offers a low extraction height, resulting in smaller and less expensive equipment and better face conditions.  Results from this study identified that for extracting an inclined thick seam, the face retreating along the strike has better operational advantages and better cavability than the face retreating updip or downdip of the seam. The operational issues of the LTCC method when extracting inclined seams are: the stability of the support, transport in the mine, and the difficulties in roof control at the transition between face ends and the gateroads.  In terms of geotechnical issues, better cavability of the top coal is anticipated for flat coal seams compared to inclined seams. In addition, the chain pillar for flat coal seams is subjected to a higher vertical stress distribution than that of inclined ones.  An improved cavability assessment method for the categorisation of the cavability of the top coal with four categories, ranging from 1 (excellent cavability) to 4 (very poor cavability), was suggested to assist the feasibility and design stages of the LTCC application. The cavability assessment method was conducted by numerical analysis combined with back analysis from the database obtained from past LTCC practices.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thick coal seam</field><field name="subject">Longwall Top Coal Caving</field><field name="subject">Inclined thick seam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the processes underlying probabilistic category learning.</field><field name="creator">Heffernan, Megan Mary, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the role of procedural learning in human probabilistic category learning (PCL). It was proposed that there was a lack of clear behavioural evidence for learning without awareness in PCL. Eleven experiments are reported that investigated the characteristics of learning in a prototypical probabilistic category learning task (the weather prediction task). The results were interpreted as contradicting the popular interpretation of weather prediction task learning as procedurally based. Rather, it was shown that behavioural data was consistent with declarative learning. This learning was not dissociable with measures of cue knowledge. Strategy analysis converged with the behavioural data, suggesting the dominance of declarative learning in this task. It was proposed that a single system account (e.g., Lagnado et al., 2006; Newell et al., 2007) which does not posit a role for procedural learning was the most appropriate way to understand learning in the weather prediction task.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Category learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cold adaptation in the Antarctic archeaon Methanococcoides burtonii: the role of the hydrophobic proteome and variations in cellular morphology</field><field name="creator">Burg, Dominic William, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Very little is known about the hydrophobic proteins of psychrophiles and their roles in cold adaptation. In light of this situation, methods were developed to analyse the hydrophobic proteome (HPP) of the model psychrophilic archaeon Methanococcoides burtonii. Central to this analysis was a novel differential solubility fractionation procedure, which resulted in a significant increase in the efficiency of resolving the HPP.  Over 50% of the detected proteins were not identified in previous whole cell extract analyses, and these underwent an intensive manual annotation process producing high quality functional assignments.  Utilising the functional assignments, biological context analysis of the HPP was performed, revealing novel and often unique biology.  The analysis acted as a platform for differential proteomics of the organism???s response to both temperature and substrate using stable isotope labelling. The results of which revealed that low temperature growth was associated with an increase in the abundance of surface and secreted proteins, and translation apparatus.  Conversely, growth at a higher temperature was associated with an increase in the abundance of general protein folding machinery and indications of an oxidative stress response, emphasising that the temperature for maximum growth rate is stressful. Through investigation of the response of M. burtonii to substrate it was found that growth on methanol was stressful, and its low energy yield resulted in an increase in the abundance of energy conserving systems. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and morphology of M. burtonii was also investigated with respect to both temperature and substrate, using a number of techniques in microscopy. It was found that the EPS was comprised of proteins, sugars and RNA, and that growth at different temperatures resulted in the production of EPS that displayed significantly different properties on dehydration, thus indicating compositional variation.  When cells were grown on methanol they took on highly irregular shapes and had electron transparent inclusions.  The observations from the ultrastructural analysis were contemplated with respect to the proteomic findings, revealing novel avenues of research.

G. Ballard's contention, that 'the act of intercourse is now always a model for something else,' to show that Don DeLillo uses a particular sexual, cultural economy of adultery, understood in its many loaded cultural and literary contexts, as a model for semantic reproduction. I contend that DeLillo's fiction evinces a promiscuous model of language that structurally reflects the myth of the adulterous triangle. The thesis makes a significant intervention into DeLillo scholarship by challenging Paul Maltby's suggestion that DeLillo's linguistic model is Romantic and pure. My analysis of the narrative operations of adultery in his work reveals the alternative promiscuous model. I discuss ten DeLillo novels and one play - Americana, Players, The Names, White Noise, Libra, Mao II,Underworld, the play Valparaiso, The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, and the pseudonymousAmazons - that feature adultery narratives. I demonstrate that these narratives resist conservative models of language, space, and sex by using promiscuity as a method of narrative control. I argue that DeLillo's adultery narratives respond subversively to attempts to categorise his work, and that he extends the mythologised rhetoric of the adulterous triangle by adopting sexual transgression as a three-sided semantic structure that connects language, sex, and space. I refer to theories of narrative, postmodernity, space, desire, and parody to show that DeLillo's adultery narratives structurally influence his experiments with linguistic meaning. My analysis reveals that contradiction performs at several spatial, sexual, and dialogical levels to undermine readings that suggest DeLillo's language models pure meaning. I identify the sexualised fissure within DeLillo's semantic style that is exposed by the operation of contradiction. I believe this gap distinguishes DeLillo from postmodern fiction's emphasis on the placeless, because it is a meaningful space that emphasises the reproductive adulteration of signification. I expose several sites of dialectic rupture, including the hotel/motel room, oppositional and metaphorical description, the journey, the image, and the secret. I contend that sex in these transgressive narratives is a model for something else: promiscuous meaning. This thesis demonstrates that DeLillo's fiction charts the typography of the mythical third side of the adulterous triangle in order to respond to language's own promiscuity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DeLillo, Don - Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Adultery in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brain reserve: a three year longitudinal neuropsychological and brain imaging examination of the ???use it or lose it??? principle</field><field name="creator">Valenzuela, Michael J., Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this dissertation was to increase scientific understanding of brain reserve. Chapter 1 describes how brain reserve has come to be viewed in two distinct ways: differential expression of brain injury on the basis of individual differences in gross brain properties (neurological), or on the basis of lifespan patterns of complex mental activity (behavioural). Evidence in the Alzheimer???s disease and ageing literature has been extensive, yet with conflicting reports. In order to better evaluate this evidence, a systematic review of cohort studies is the focus of Chapter 2. Complex mental activity was found to be associated with reduced incidence of dementia and slowed rate of cognitive decline. Neurological brain reserve evidence was limited. A major task of this dissertation was to develop a more standard and complete behavioural brain reserve instrument. Chapter 3 relates the development of the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) in a group of 86 healthy elderly. The LEQ had adequate levels of internal consistency and reliability. In a validation test, higher LEQ scores were also found to predict attenuated cognitive decline over 18 months independent of covariates including premorbid IQ. Chapter 4 describes how both LEQ (as a measure of behavioural brain reserve) and intracranial volume (as a measure of neurological brain reserve) significantly predicted cognitive decline over three years in a sample of 70 aged subjects. Total LEQ was furthermore significantly correlated with hippocampal volume independent of intracranial volume, and this association mediated the relationship with cognitive decline. Behavioural brain reserve may therefore work by protecting individuals from hippocampal atrophy. The fifth chapter explores therapeutic and neurobiological aspects of behavioural brain reserve in a preliminary fashion. A randomized-control mental activity trial was run with 20 healthy elderly who received repeat magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mental activity subjects were found to have selective and sustained upregulation of phosphocreatine metabolism in the hippocampal region, a finding of potential neuroprotective significance. Experience-dependent neuroplasticity is proposed as a unifying framework in the final chapter, allowing synthesis of the present findings and reconciliation of the neurological and behavioural approaches to brain reserve.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">brain imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware implementation of V-BLAST MIMO</field><field name="creator">Sobhanmanesh, Fariborz, School of Electrical Engineering And Telecommunications, UNSW</field><field name="description">The exploitation of the theoretically enormous capacity achieved by the multiple transmit and receive antennas systems (MIMO) in a rich scattering communication channel has been the subject of vast body of research on the field of MIMO. In particular, the Vertically-layered Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) is a well known MIMO architecture which has demonstrated the enormous capacity of 20-40 bit/s/Hz in an indoor propagation environment with realistic SNR and error rates. However, due to the intensive computation involved, it would be difficult to implement this architecture for high data rate communication systems. Some works have been done to improve the receiver complexity and performance by coding techniques, by different detection architectures. In this thesis, we have focused on QR-based decoders for V-BLAST MIMO. For a suitable V-BLAST detection implementation, we need to carefully consider the problem from algorithmic, arithmetic and architectural aspects. At the algorithmic level, the numerical stability and robustness should be considered. At the arithmetic level, signal quantization is important, and, at the architectural level, parallelism and pipelining require attention. We have performed the above mentioned optimization on the 1-pass QR factorization with back substitution SIC (Symbol Interference Cancellation) decoder in chapter 3. At first optimizations are made on the proposed algorithm and architecture using MATLAB simulations. Then a new architecture for the QR-factorizer as the core processor of the V-BLAST decoder is developed in chapter 4. This architecture uses only two low complexity CORDIC (Coordinate rotation digital computer) processors.  The parameterized feature of the controller and address generator blocks of this architecture has provided a scalable architecture for the implementation of QR factorization for square matrix of any dimension. The reduced hardware complexity of the processors and its simple parameterized controller are two outstanding features of the architecture, resulting in a more suitable alternative architecture for QR factorization than traditional triangular systolic arrays. In the next phase of the research, new hardware architectures of the back substitution SIC decoder was developed for a 4 X 4 MIMO system with 16-QAM constellation scheme in chapter 5. The division operation for back substitution needs a complex hardware, and results in the numerical instability. In the proposed hardware the elimination of division and modification of multiplier has reduced the hardware complexity and led to numerical stability. In addition the pre decoding block was designed and optimized in terms of number of the pipeline registers and CORDIC rotator processors. The developed hardware is capable of processing 20 vectors data burst and results in a throughput of 149 Mb/s. The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and ASIC (Application specific Integrated Circuit) implementations of the proposed optimized architecture are presented in Chapter 5. We found that the equivalent gates and the core area in our design is less than 30% of other designs and the maximum clock frequency and the throughput is higher (175 %) than other works. Finally the improvements of the BER performance using the branching method and parallel architectures are presented in chapter 6. In this supplementary part to back substitution OSIC decoder, the final symbol vector is selected from 2 or 8 potential candidates based on the minimum Euclidean norm, which improves the BER between 3 to 7 db and gives a very close match to the original V-BLAST performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO systems</field><field name="subject">Space time codes</field><field name="subject">Antenna arrays</field><field name="subject">Signal processing - digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and horses : a study of Australia's recreational horsewomen</field><field name="creator">Burr, Sandra</field><field name="description">This dissertation is a fusion of three grand passions that invigorate my life - a love of books and reading; a love of words and writing; and a profound and enduring love of horses. I am particularly attracted to the stories of other horsewomen, and while I identify with much that is written about women and horses, my own story and that of most contemporary Australian recreational horsewomen, is largely missing.

Australia has a long tradition of horsemanship, a culture which in recent decades has become largely feminised and mostly recreational. Despite this reorientation, horses continue to be associated with such durable tropes as the outback, and 'the race that stops a nation', yet these masculine discourses are no longer representative of modern equestrian culture. The profound changes in what was once a vital sector of Australian society have been overlooked by scholars and creative practitioners alike, and it is only now that Australia's contemporary horsewomen have become a topic of academic inquiry. By examining the nature of the relationships between women and horses, I illuminate this unique culture, and in doing so extend our understandings of what it is to be Australian.

I conducted the research using a combination of traditional and creative paradigms that allow multiple readings of what it is to be a horsewoman. The exegesis contains the data from which two interpretations of horsewomen emerge: an insider's view told by the women themselves; and an outsider's view constructed from an interpretive analysis of the data. My own subjective experiences are recorded in the collected essays, poems and visual material of the creative work.

However, the mechanisms involved in tissue degradation due to cigarette smoking are not clear. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are a system of molecules that regulate bone resorption. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of soluble RANKL (sRANKL), OPG and their relative ratio in GCF among periodontitis patients with varying smoking histories. Material and Methods: GCF samples were collected from 149 periodontitis patients who were never smokers (n=58), former smokers (n=39) and current smokers (n=52). sRANKL and OPG concentrations in GCF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: sRANKL, OPG and their relative ratio were not statistically significant among the never smokers, former smokers and current smokers. However, OPG was significantly reduced and subsequently the sRANKL:OPG ratio was significantly increased in the high pack-years group as compared with never smokers. The positive correlation between packyears and sRANKL:OPG ratio was statistically significant even after adjusting for age and current smoking status. Conclusion: Increased lifetime exposure to cigarette smoking above a minimum threshold suppresses OPG production and leads to increased sRANKL:OPG. This may partially explain increased bone loss in smoking-related periodontitis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periodontics; smoking</field><field name="subject">Gingival fluid.</field><field name="subject">Smoking Health aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple trait analysis for genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci for carcass and beef quality</field><field name="creator">Koshkoih, Ali Esmailizadeh</field><field name="description">The use of molecular markers to identify quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) affecting economically important traits has become a key approach in animal genetics, both for understanding the genetic basis of these traits and to help design novel breeding programs. The general goal of the present work was to map QTL for economically important traits in beef cattle. Because of the practical limitations of phenotypic selection for meat quality, these traits are ideal candidates for the use of marker - assisted selection. Thus, the thesis specifically focused on carcass and beef quality traits. Six half - sib families were generated by mating six Limousin x Jersey crossbred sires to purebred Jersey or Limousin cows, producing 784 backcross progeny ( 366 and 418 progeny in Australia and New Zealand, respectively ). The six crossbred sires and all the backcross progeny were genotyped for 285 microsatellite markers ( on average 189 informative loci per sire family ) spread across the 29 bovine autosomes. A large number of traits were recorded on backcross progeny. In the first phase of the research, a single - QTL model based on regression interval mapping was used to map QTL for a wide range of economically important traits in the beef industry. Chromosome - wise significant evidence for linkage was found on BTA12 ( P &lt; 0.01 ) and BTA16 ( P &lt; 0.05 ) for age at puberty. Thirteen QTL were found to affect calving ease related traits ( birth weight, pelvic area and gestation length ). BTA11, 14 and 22 were most significant linkage groups affecting calving ease traits. Several genomic regions were linked to the carcass and beef quality traits. The results revealed a major QTL on BTA2 close to the map position of myostatin gene, affecting yield, carcass fatness and beef quality traits. In the second phase, the pleiotropic effects of a myostatin functional SNP on beef traits were studied. There was no association between this myostatin variant and birth weight and growth traits. However, the variant decreased overall fatness, increased muscle mass and improved meat tenderness, thus providing an intermediate and more useful phenotype than the more severe double - muscling phenotype caused by a major deletion in the myostatin gene described by others. In the third phase, a multiple marker analysis approach in the framework of the mixed - effects model was developed, allowing all markers of the entire genome to be included in the analysis simultaneously. Further, exploiting a factor analytic covariance structure for modeling trait by marker or family by marker interaction terms, the approach was extended to the multi - trait and multiple family situations. The simulation study showed that modeling multiple phenotypes and multiple families in a single linkage analysis simultaneously can markedly increase the power to detect QTL, compared to modeling each phenotype or family separately. Finally, the multi - trait multiple QTL approach developed herein was applied to map QTL influencing carcass and meat quality traits. Several pleoitropic QTL and also traitspecific QTL affecting beef traits were mapped, resulting in a useful resource from which fine mapping can be launched for subsequent gene discovery and marker - assisted selection.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meat quality, beef cattle, quantitative genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping.</field><field name="subject">Beef cattle Breeding Economic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fate and effects of human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Michael</field><field name="description">There is relatively little known about the fate of human pharmaceuticals once they are released into the aquatic environment and what adverse impacts these compounds have on exposed aquatic organisms. Both of these factors are essential in defining the potential risk pharmaceuticals pose in the aquatic environment. For this project up to 14 human therapeutic agents were selected as representative compounds to assess both their fate and effects within model aquatic systems. Considering sediments often serve as a repository for aquatic contaminants, the interaction of the selected pharmaceuticals with sediment was assessed. The sorption of the selected pharmaceuticals was found to be highly variable. Furthermore, the solution pH and ionic strength, due to Ca2+, were found to exert a large degree of influence on the extent of sorption observed. These solution parameters, among others, may therefore make it difficult to predict the fate of pharmaceuticals, in terms of their association with sediments, using standardised assessment methods alone. There is an extensive pool of knowledge on pharmaceuticals, in terms of their pharmacological profile, so their distribution within the human body (using the volume of distribution or VD) was compared with their distribution within a sediment / water system (using the partition coefficient or Kd). The correlation between the VD and Kd indicated this relationship provided a reasonable basis for estimating the distribution of drugs within the test sediment / water systems. This finding suggests that further exploration of the use of pharmacological data in understanding the potential fate of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems is warranted. The extent of the pharmaceuticals respective desorption values was also found to be highly variable within a standard test system. Further analysis on the desorption of carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic drug, was undertaken using an isotopic dilution technique. Observations from the isotopic dilution study indicated that both contact time with sediment and the quality of organic carbon could play an important role in the potential for sediments to irreversibly sorb carbamazepine present in aquatic systems. The desorption hysteresis observed for the other pharmaceuticals also indicates considerable effort is still required to address the issue of whether sediments can be a means of reducing exposure of pharmaceuticals to aquatic organisms (a &#8220;sink&#8221;) or a means of increasing exposure to sediment-dependent organisms (a &#8220;source&#8221;). The necessity for further work on investigating the role that sorption with sediments may play in the fate and effects of human pharmaceuticals was highlighted by a series of ecotoxicological assays in both sediment and solution-only systems. Sediment-dwelling freshwater midges, Chironomus tepperi, were exposed to carbamazepine in both short- and long-term assays. Wet weight was found to be significantly reduced during short-term assays, while the development of C. tepperi larvae was found to be significantly inhibited when exposed to spiked sediment, over a longer exposure period. For these assays, the aqueous phase may have been a more important route of exposure of carbamazepine for the midges. This study has indicated that sediments are likely to play an important role in the fate of pharmaceuticals and, subsequently, their effects. However, considerably more effort is required to assess the role sediments have and how this knowledge can be linked with current regulatory ecological risk assessments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analytical; ecotoxicology; sorption; pharmacology; distribution; sediment; water</field><field name="subject">Water Pollution Toxicology.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic organisms Effect of drugs on.</field><field name="subject">Drugs Environmental aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stone crown : a novel.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Malcolm</field><field name="description">Title page and prologue v.2; Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

Economic and environmental impacts and the emerging resistance to fungicides and dominant resistance genes are reasons to understand molecular defence responses in order to develop new strategies to increase resistance of barley to this pathogen. In most pathosystems, defence gene expression in susceptible or resistant genotypes commonly differs quantitatively. Thus, differentially expressed genes between genotypes contrasting for response to infection by pathogens are considered candidate genes that have a role in resistance. This thesis presents functional analysis of a subset of genes isolated from a Suppression Subtractive Hybridisation library. The library was previously established and enriched for differentially expressed genes in epidermis of resistant and susceptible near-isogenic barley cultivars inoculated with R. secalis. Functional characterisation involved both investigating their putitative biochemical function as well as the genes&#8223; role(s) in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Three cDNA clones from the library were selected based on the putative function of the encoded proteins and the full length of the clones and their homologues were isolated from cDNA and genomic DNA. One of the clones represented a member of the pathogenesis-related protein family 17 (PR-17). Southern hybridisation showed that a small multigene family encodes the barley PR-17 proteins. Three members were cloned with two of them being novel. The second clone was homologous to galactinol synthases (GolS) and Southern blot analysis indicated existence of two GolS genes in the barley genome and subsequently two HvGolS members were isolated. The last clone (a single gene) showed similarity to very long chain fatty acid elongases, which indicates its involvement in synthesis of cuticular waxes. A characterised Arabidopsis mutant named fiddlehead (Atfdh) was highly similar to this gene and it was named HvFdh. Detailed expression analysis using Q-PCR, Northern blot analysis and publically available microarray data revealed that the isolated genes are regulated in response to a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses as well as different tissues during barley development. Under some treatments expression patterns were consistent with their putative roles and in agreement with results of other studies. Nevertheless, in other treatments expression profiles were not in agreement with previous findings in other plants indicating potentially different stress adaptation mechanisms between species. Further insight into the function of the encoded proteins was gained by their subcellular localisation using transient expression as GFP fusion proteins followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results were in agreement with in silico predictions and their putative cellular function. In addition, a comprehensive list of homologous genes from other species was compiled for each gene by using public EST databases. Analyses of phylogenetic relationship and multiple sequence alignment of the homologues provided further clues to their function and conserved regions of the proteins. HvPR-17 anti-fungal properties were investigated by heterologous protein expression in E. coli and subsequent in vitro bioassays using purified protein under different conditions against a number of phytopathogenic fungi. However, no anti-fungal activity was observed. A construct with the AtFdh promoter driving the coding region of barley Fiddlehead was used for complementation of the Arabidopsis fiddlehead mutant to investigate functional orthology between these genes from dicots and monocots. The Arabidopsis fiddlehead mutant phenotype that shows contact-mediated organ fusion, germination of spore on epidermis and reduced number of trichomes was completely reverted by HvFdh. Finally, more than fifty transgenic barley lines were regenerated over-expressing or suppressing one of the three genes. The analyses of the transgenic progeny exhibited some interesting developmental phenotypes and resistance to scald and drought tolerance. These lines are awaiting further experiments to investigate the effect of altered expression in conferring resistance to other pathogens and abiotic stress tolerance as well as biochemical analysis. Collectively, in this work six barley genes were cloned and characterised by a variety of in silico techniques, temporal and transient expression analyses, subcellular localisation, in vitro bioassays and mutant complementation in Arabidopsis and loss- and gain-of-function transgenic barley plants. This work has provided insight into the function of these gene families in barley. Furthermore, the data suggest that they are regulated by the defence response to pathogenic fungi as well as drought, salinity and frost in barley.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scald; Barley; Rhynchosporium secalis; Disease resistance; Fatty acid elongase; Galactinol synthase; Pathogenesis related protein; Gene expression; Phytogenetic analysis; Subcellular localisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weed resistance risk management in glyphosate-resistant cotton</field><field name="creator">Werth, Jeff Alan</field><field name="description">The introduction of glyphosate resistance into Australian cotton systems will have an effect on conventional weed management practices, the weed species present and the risk of glyphosate resistance evolving in weed species. Therefore, it is important that the effects of these management practices, particularly a potential reduction in Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices, be examined to determine their impact on weed population dynamics and resistance selection. The study began in 2003 with a survey of 40 growers in four major cotton growing regions in Australia to gain an understanding of how adoption of glyphosate resistance had influenced the weed spectrum, weed management practices and herbicide use after three years of glyphosate-resistant cotton being available. The 10 most common weeds reported on cotton fields were the same in glyphosate-resistant and conventional fields. In this survey, herbicide use patterns were altered by the adoption of glyphosate-resistant cotton with up to six times more glyphosate being applied and with 21% fewer growers applying pre-emergence herbicides in glyphosate-resistant cotton fields. Other weed control practices, such as the use of post-emergence herbicides, inter-row cultivation and hand hoeing, were only reduced marginally. A systems experiment was conducted to determine differences in the population dynamics of Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) and Urochloa panicoides (liverseed grass) under a range of weed management regimes in a glyphosate-resistant cotton system. These treatments ranged from a full IWM system to a system based soley on the use of glyphosate. The experiment investigated the effect of the treatments on the soil seed bank, weed germination patterns and weed numbers in the field. All applied treatments resulted in commercially acceptable control of the two grass weeds. However, the treatments containing soil-applied residual herbicides proved to be more effective over the period of the experiment. The treatment with a reduced residual herbicide program supplemented with glyphosate had a level of control similar to the full IWM treatments with less input, providing a more economical option. The effectiveness of these treatments in the long-term was examined in a simulation model to determine the likelihood of glyphosate resistance evolving using barnyardgrass and liverseed grass as model weeds. Seed production and above-ground biomass of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass in competition with cotton were measured. In all experiments, seed production and biomass plant&#8315;&#185;  decreased as weed density increased while seed production and biomass m&#8315;&#185; tended to increase. Seed production m&#8315;&#185; reached 40,000 and 60,000 for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. In 2004-05, weeds were also planted 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the cotton was planted. Biomass and seed production of the two weeds planted 6 weeks after cotton were significantly reduced with seed production declining to 12,000 and 2,500 seeds m&#8315;&#185; row for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. Weeds planted 12 weeks after cotton planting failed to emerge. This experiment highlighted the importance of early season weed control and effective management of weeds that are able to produce high seed numbers. A glyphosate dose-mortality experiment was conducted in the field to determine levels of control of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass. Glyphosate provided effective control of both species with over 85% control when the rate applied was greater than 690 g ae ha&#8315;&#185;. Dose-mortality curves for both species were obtained for use in the glyphosate resistance model. Data from the experimental work were combined to develop a glyphosate resistance model. Outputs from this model suggest that if glyphosate were used as the only form of weed control, resistance in weeds is likely to eventuate after 12 to 17 years, depending on the characteristics of the weed species, initial resistance gene frequencies and any associated fitness penalties. If glyphosate was used in conjunction with one other weed control method, resistance was delayed but not prevented. The simulations suggested that when a combination of weed control options was employed in addition to glyphosate, resistance would not evolve over the 30-year period of the simulation. These simulations underline the importance of an integrated strategy in weed management to prevent glyphosate resistance evolving from the use of glyphosate-resistant cotton. Current management conditions of growing glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready &amp;reg) cotton should therefore prevent glyphosate resistance evolution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cotton, weeds--control, herbicides, herbicide resistance, glyphosate</field><field name="subject">Weeds Control</field><field name="subject">Cotton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of abscisic acid in grape berry development.</field><field name="creator">Wheeler, Susan Faith.</field><field name="description">Hormones control plant development by coordinating changes in the expression of numerous genes at crucial times in a tissue and organ-specific manner. They have been implicated in controlling various aspects of grape berry development, in particular, the important process of ripening and are used in some crops to control growth and ripening. Abscisic acid (ABA), is associated in grapevine with the response to water stress but may also have a role in berry ripening. We have shown over three seasons that ABA levels in Cabernet Sauvignon berries increase dramatically at veraison, consistent with it being involved either as a trigger for ripening or as a response to the increase in sugars that occurs at this time. Net ABA accumulation doesn't occur until veraison, the decrease in ABA concentration in the first phase of berry development being due to berry expansion. The decrease in ABA that occurs later in development is likely to be due to a combination of catabolism and sequestration into the bound form. The genes crucial to ABA synthesis, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), were expressed throughout berry development and no clear correlation was found between their levels and that of ABA. Laboratory studies have shown that isolated berries respond to the presence of sucrose through an increase in ABA biosynthesis pathway gene expression (NCED and ZEP). This resulted in de novo synthesis of ABA as inhibition of the carotenoid synthesis pathway by a phytoene desaturase inhibitor prevented ABA accumulation. Replicated field trials clearly showed that ABA treatments can be effective in significantly enhancing ripening when applied in at or near the end of the first period of berry expansion. Colour accumulation in the skins commenced earlier in ABA-treated fruit as did the increase in sugar levels. ABA treatment also advanced the timing of the second phase of berry expansion as it appeared to eliminate the lag phase of berry growth. Taken together these data demonstrate that ABA is likely to play some part in the control of berry ripening and can be used to advance the timing of ripening. Further investigation into the characteristics of ABA-treated fruit will be needed to investigate the compositional character of treated fruit and to gauge its suitability for winemaking. An ability to control the timing of ripening may provide considerable benefits to the wine industry in terms of wine style/quality and for winery scheduling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grape; berry; hormone; ABA; abscisic</field><field name="subject">Abscisic acid.</field><field name="subject">Viticulture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the tectonic framework of the Musgrave Province, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Wade, Benjamin P.</field><field name="description">The importance of the Musgrave Province in continental reconstructions of Proterozoic Australia is only beginning to be appreciated. The Mesoproterozoic Musgrave Province sits in a geographically central location within Australia and is bounded by older and more isotopically evolved regions including the Gawler Craton of South Australia and Arunta Region of the Northern Territory. Understanding the crustal growth and deformation mechanisms involved in the formation of the Musgrave Province, and also the nature of the basement that separates these tectonic elements, allows for greater insight into defining the timing and processes responsible for the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. The ca. 1.60-1.54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss preserves geochemical and isotopic signatures related to ongoing arc-magmatism in an active margin between the North Australian and South Australian Cratons (NAC and SAC). Characteristic geochemical patterns of the Musgravian Gneiss include negative anomalies in Nb, Ti, and Y, and are accompanied by steep LREE patterns. Also characteristic of the Musgravian Gneiss is its juvenile Nd isotopic composition (&#603;Nd1.55 values from -1.2 to +0.9). The juvenile isotopic signature of the Musgravian Gneiss separates it from the bounding comparitively isotopically evolved terranes of the Arunta Region and Gawler Craton. The geochemical and isotopic signatures of these early Mesoproterozoic felsic rocks have similarities with island arc systems involving residual Ti-bearing minerals and garnet. Circa 1.40 Ga metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province also record vital evidence for determining Australia.s location and fit within a global plate reconstruction context during the late Mesoproterozoic. U-Pb detrital zircon and Sm-Nd isotopic data from these metasedimentary rocks suggests a component of derivation from sources outside of the presently exposed Australian crust. Best fit matches come from rocks originating from eastern Laurentia. Detrital zircon ages range from Palaeoproterozoic to late Mesoproterozoic, constraining the maximum depositional age of the metasediments to approximately 1.40 Ga, similar to that of the Belt Supergroup in western Laurentia. The 1.49-1.36 Ga detrital zircons in the Musgrave metasediments are interpreted to have been derived from the voluminous A-type suites of Laurentia, as this time period represents a &#8220;magmatic gap&#8221; in Australia, with an extreme paucity of sources this age recognized. The metasedimentary rocks exhibit a range of Nd isotopic signatures, with &#603;Nd(1.4 Ga) values ranging from -5.1 to 0.9, inconsistent with complete derivation from Australian sources, which are more isotopically evolved. The isotopically juvenile ca. 1.60-1.54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss is also an excellent candidate for the source of the abundant ca. 1.6-1.54 Ga detrital zircons within the lower sequences of the Belt Supergroup. If these interpretations are correct, they support a palaeogeographic reconstruction involving proximity of Australia and Laurentia during the pre-Rodinia Mesoproterozoic. This also increases the prospectivity of the eastern Musgrave Province to host a metamorphised equivalent of the massive Pb-Zn-Ag Sullivan deposit. The geochemical and isotopic signatures recorded in mafic-ultramafic rocks can divulge important information regarding the state of the sub continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The voluminous cumulate mafic-ultramafic rocks of the ca. 1.08 Ga Giles Complex record geochemical and Nd-Sr isotopic compositions consistent with an enriched parental magma. Traverses across three layered intrusions, the Kalka, Ewarara, and Gosse Pile were geochemically and isotopically analysed. Whole rock samples display variably depleted to enriched LREE patterns when normalised to chondrite ((La/Sm)N = 0.43-4.72). Clinopyroxene separates display similar depleted to enriched LREE patterns ((La/Sm)N = 0.37-7.33) relative to a chondritic source. The cumulate rocks display isotopically evolved signatures (&#603;Nd ~-1.0 to .5.0 and &#603;Sr ~19.0 to 85.0). Using simple bulk mixing and AFC equations, the Nd-Sr data of the more radiogenic samples can be modelled by addition of ~10% average Musgrave crust to a primitive picritic source, without need for an enriched mantle signature. Shallow decompressional melting of an asthenospheric plume source beneath thinned Musgravian lithosphere is envisaged as a source for the parental picritic magma. A model involving early crustal contamination within feeder zones is favoured, and consequently explorers looking for Ni-Cu-Co sulphides should concentrate on locating these feeder zones. Few absolute age constraints exist for the timing of the intracratonic Petermann Orogeny of the Musgrave Province. The Petermann Orogeny is responsible for much of the lithospheric architecture we see today within the Musgrave Province, uplifting and exhuming large parts along crustal scale E-W trending fault/shear systems. Isotopic and geochemical analysis of a suite of stratigraphic units within the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Officer Basin to the immediate south indicate the development of a foreland architecture at ca. 600 Ma. An excursion in &#603;Nd values towards increasingly less negative values at this time is interpreted as representing a large influx of Musgrave derived sediments. Understanding the nature of the basement separating the SAC from the NAC and WAC is vital in constructing models of the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. This region is poorly understood as it is overlain by the thick sedimentary cover of the Officer Basin. However, the Coompana Block is one place where basement is shallow enough to be intersected in drillcore. The previously geochronologically, geochemically, and isotopically uncharacterised granitic gneiss of the Coompana Block represents an important period of within-plate magmatism during a time of relative magmatic quiescence in the Australian Proterozoic. U-Pb LA-ICPMS dating of magmatic zircons provides an age of ca. 1.50 Ga, interpreted as the crystallisation age of the granite protolith. The samples have distinctive A-type chemistry characterised by high contents of Zr, Nb, Y, Ga, LREE with low Mg#, Sr, CaO and HREE. &#603;Nd values are high with respect to surrounding exposed crust of the Musgrave Province and Gawler Craton, and range from +1.2 to +3.3 at 1.5 Ga. The tectonic environment into which the granite was emplaced is also unclear, however one possibility is emplacement within an extensional environment represented by interlayered basalts and arenaceous sediments of the Coompana Block. Regardless, the granitic gneiss intersected in Mallabie 1 represents magmatic activity during the &#8220;Australian magmatic gap&#8221; of ca. 1.52-1.35 Ga, and is a possible source for detrital ca. 1.50 zircons found within sedimentary rocks of Tasmania and Antarctica, and metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology; Geomorphology; Geology, Structural; Paleontology--Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Historical geology Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Australia South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Australia Northern Territory.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic Proterozoic.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic Cambrian.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the function and regulation of the centrosomal protein NEDD1 during cell division and development.</field><field name="creator">Manning, Jantina</field><field name="description">The centrosome is the major microtubule organising centre of cells and serves as a centralised location for controlling many cellular processes. A critical component of the centrosome is the &#947;-tubulin ring complex (&#947;-TuRC) which is required for the nucleation of microtubules, correct formation of the mitotic spindle and hence progression of the cell cycle. NEDD1 (mouse: Nedd1), was recently discovered as a centrosomal protein which functions primarily in targeting the &#947;-TuRC to the centrosome and spindle. Given the fundamental role of the centrosome in mitosis and other processes, it is no surprise that this organelle is essential during mouse development. To examine the precise role of the centrosome during development, this study analysed the expression and localisation of Nedd1 during mouse embryogenesis. This revealed a dynamic localisation of Nedd1 and the centrosome during development, and provides further evidence for their critical role in development. To investigate the regulation of NEDD1, its expression during the cell cycle was analysed. It was found that phosphorylation is the primary method of NEDD1 regulation. Additionally, it was observed that Nedd1 levels decreased upon the entry of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cell culture-induced senescence (an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest). This correlated with a loss of centrosomal integrity. Ablation of Nedd1 in healthy cells caused premature senescence and centrosome abnormalities, suggesting that Nedd1 and the centrosome may contribute to this senescence. NEDD1 is also important in the recruitment of the &#947;-TuRC to the centrosome, which is essential for correct centrosome biogenesis and function. This study identified a 62 amino acid region of NEDD1 that interacts with &#947;-tubulin and can abrogate its function. Key residues important for this interaction were also revealed. Additional interacting proteins of NEDD1 were also identified, and the chaperone TCP-1&#945; was characterised in more detail and shown to regulate NEDD1. Given the currently known functions of NEDD1, it was expected to be important in development. Zebrafish were chosen as a model to study this because of their many advantages for developmental studies. A zebrafish homologue of NEDD1 was identified that displayed a similar localisation and function to mammalian NEDD1. Depletion of this protein caused lethality or phenotypic abnormalities which were most obvious in the central nervous system, depending on the extent of knockdown. This demonstrates that NEDD1 is critical for development, particularly in the nervous system. The results presented in this thesis contribute to the understanding of the function and regulation of NEDD1, and thus also the centrosome, and highlights the importance of this protein during development. Additionally, this study forms the foundation for further work on centrosomes, using NEDD1 as a marker for centrosomal dynamics and function.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NEDD1; centrosome; development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the slide photography of Gladys Cunningham</field><field name="creator">Benjamin, Julie Maree</field><field name="description">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the Slide Photography of Gladys Cunningham This thesis focuses on the amateur slide photography of Gladys Cunningham, formerly of Onehunga, Auckland. Viewed collectively, these slides provide a visual autobiography of a New Zealand woman&#8217;s life, as well as a larger social narrative. As Gladys&#8217;s granddaughter, I argue that Gladys&#8217;s 35mm colour transparencies, nostalgic fragments that memorialise a family history, are informed by the social history of European New Zealanders between the early 1950s and early 1970s. Gladys&#8217;s slides reflect stabilities and changes for the photographer herself, her family and New Zealand society. While the term &#8220;transparency&#8221; suggests that the meaning of a slide can be understood by all, in reality further contextual information is necessary to appreciate the family and public histories from which these scenes have been separated. To situate Gladys&#8217;s slides, I refer to popular magazines and tourist texts from this period, including The Weekly News, National Geographic and New Zealand Holiday, and to commercial slides, postcards and travel marketing texts. I analyse the near absence of Maori within Gladys&#8217;s slides and travel journalism, suggesting that their omissions represent a lack of dialogue between Pakeha and Maori. In New Zealand and overseas, slide photography was the popular medium for recording extraordinary family events during the 1950 and 1960s. Through an analysis of memory, leisure and photography, this study examines how Gladys&#8217;s photography documents family and community membership and celebration. I explore how aesthetically pleasing representations of family leisure also contain partly concealed clues to less positive memories and to secrets that were not unique to this family. I discuss the impact of private and public transport on Gladys&#8217;s slide photography, noting how car travel facilitated spatial and temporal freedoms, and how slide photography strengthened connections to extended family and distant communities. In contrast, Gladys and Jim&#8217;s later dependence on coach transport enhanced their ability to take slides and expanded the &#8220;family&#8221; gaze of their camera, but limited their photographic opportunities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Life and customs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Conditions</field><field name="subject">Travel photography</field><field name="subject">Landscape Photography new Zealand</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical Memory</field><field name="subject">Photography of Families</field><field name="subject">Women New Zealand Auckland Biography</field><field name="subject">Photography Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photography New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Camera Clubs</field><field name="subject">Visual Culture</field><field name="subject">Amateur Photography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Photography)</field><field name="subject">Women Photographers New Zealand Biography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Transparencies)</field><field name="subject">Tourism New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Leisure Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Community Life New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Family New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photographic Society of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Onehunga (Auckland NZ) History</field><field name="subject">Automobiles Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipiodol fertility enhancement in unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Neil Philip</field><field name="description">Objectives This thesis had the following objectives: 1) To assess the existing evidence base for the effectiveness of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section II, Chapters 4 and 5). 2) To assess current practice and prior beliefs amongst Australasian fertility specialists concerning the role of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section III, Chapter 6). 3) To investigate the possible mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect of the oil soluble contrast medium lipiodol, and specifically whether there is an effect on the endometrium (Section IV, Chapter 7). 4) To generate definitive evidence from a randomised controlled trial for the effectiveness of lipiodol flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section V, Chapters 8 and 9). 5) To evaluate the adoption of lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment into clinical practice (Section VI, Chapter 10). Methods The work undertaken in this thesis was based on prospective study protocols using the following research methodologies: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of treatment efficacy to meet objective 1. Two types of structured survey questionnaires with a Bayesian analysis to meet objective 2. A randomised animal study involving 60 Swiss white mice, combined with genital flushing procedures under anaesthesia, some of which involved microsurgical techniques, followed by genital tissue harvesting, tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry studies to meet objective 3. An open, parallel group, single centre, randomised controlled trial involving 158 women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility to meet objective 4. A survival analysis of women in the lipiodol flushing randomised trial to meet objectives 4 and 5. A prospective observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol flushing in clinical practice to meet objective 5. A clinical hysterosalpingogram procedure to meet objective 4 and 5. Results 1) Eight randomised controlled trials involving 1,971 women were identified and included in the systematic review. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media versus no intervention was associated with a significant increase in the odds of pregnancy (Peto odds ratio [OR] 3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76 to 7.23) but there were no data for live birth. There were no data from RCTs to assess tubal flushing with water-soluble media versus no intervention. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media was associated with a significant increase in the odds of live birth versus tubal flushing with water soluble contrast media (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.11) but the odds of pregnancy showed no significant difference (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.57) and there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes. The addition of oil soluble contrast media to flushing with water soluble contrast media (water plus oil soluble contrast media versus water soluble contrast media alone) showed no significant difference in the odds of live birth (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.77) or pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70). 2) Nineteen Australasian fertility specialists returned survey questionnaires. Eighteen of the 19 specialists believed that lipiodol flushing was more likely to be beneficial than harmful. The most widely held prior belief, reflected in both textual and numerical responses, was that lipiodol was likely to produce a small beneficial response. The credible limits of this belief were compatible with a reasonable fertility benefit, as more than 50% believed that a 1.5-fold increase in pregnancy rate was plausible. The two surveys found that a 1.2-fold or 1.4-fold increase in pregnancy rate was the median expected level of benefit at which clinicians would have been inclined to recommend lipiodol flushing to their patients (combined range 1.1 to 2.3-fold). Individual and collective equipoise was justification to proceed with a definitive randomised controlled trial. 3) The mean number of cluster determinant (CD) 205+ uterine dendritic cells decreased significantly in mice following lipiodol treatment compared to sham treated and saline treated mice, particularly in endometrial and subendometrial tissues. The mean number of CD1+ uterine dendritic cells increased significantly following lipiodol treatment compared to shamtreatment. No significant differences were found in the mean number of total leukocytes or macrophages in the murine uterus between the three treatment groups. 4) Six month follow up of the randomised trial of 158 women showed that lipiodol flushing resulted in a significant increase in pregnancy (48.0% versus 10.8%, RR 4.44, 95% CI 1.61-12.21) and live birth (40.0% versus 10.8%, RR 3.70,.95% CI 1.30-10.50) rates versus no intervention for women with endometriosis (n=62), although there was no significant difference in pregnancy (33.3% versus 20.8%, RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.81-3.16) or live birth (27.1% versus 14.6%, RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.81-4.25) rates for women with unexplained infertility without confirmed endometriosis (n=96). Survival analysis up to 24 months showed a significant benefit in overall pregnancy rate following lipiodol treatment (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.2) for the combined endometriosis and unexplained infertility populations. Amongst women with endometriosis, the benefit in pregnancy rate seen in the first 6 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 5.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 14.2) was not present at 6 to 24 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.1). There was a more consistent effect of lipiodol on fertility throughout the 24 month follow up amongst women with unexplained infertility (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.5). 5) Six month follow up in the observational study of 100 women undergoing lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment in clinical practice showed an overall pregnancy rate 30% and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate 27% six months after the procedure. For women under 40 years old, a 32% pregnancy rate and 25% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with unexplained infertility; a 50% pregnancy rate and 47% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with endometriosis. Of women aged 40 years and older, the pregnancy rate was 13% and the live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was 13%. The pregnancy rates included those occurring after additional interventions, such as intrauterine insemination and in-vitro fertilisation, accounting for 12 of the 30 pregnancies. There were no treatment complications. Conclusions The conclusions of this thesis are as follows. Lipiodol flushing is a simple, inexpensive, effective fertility treatment, which carries a very low chance of complications and no increased chance of multiple pregnancy. Lipiodol treatment is particularly effective in the short term for women with endometriosis who have normal patent fallopian tubes. The fertility benefit from lipiodol treatment lasts longer for women with pure unexplained infertility than for women with endometriosis. The level of benefit from lipiodol treatment for women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility is of sufficient magnitude to convince most fertility specialists surveyed that it is a worthwhile treatment to offer routinely in clinical practice; however complex factors govern the implementation of an innovative fertility treatment. Observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol treatment in clinical practice has provided further evidence of the efficacy and safety of this approach. Uterine dendritic cell changes following lipiodol flushing in mice suggest that the mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect might be an immunobiologic effect on the endometrium that could improve the receptivity of the endometrium (rather than a mechanical tubal flushing effect), although this hypothesis requires further exploration in women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Emissions from Aluminium Electrolysis Cells</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Edwin Campbell</field><field name="description">Modern aluminium electrolysis cells generate between 15 to 40 kg fluoride per tonne of aluminium fluoride produced. This represent a large material recycle load, of which over 99% of this fluoride content is returned to the cell via a dry scrubbing system. Most past research has concentrated on increasing the efficiency of this end scrubbing system, neglecting the actual cause of the fluoride emissions. Lower emissions would reduce this loading, resulting in smaller scrubbing systems, and ultimately lower capital costs. Fluoride emissions also contribute to the changes in heat balance in the cell. The fluoride evolved represents a material loss that requires to be replaced with AlF3. The addition of this species is a major variable in cell heat balance instability [1]. Overall a better understanding of the contributors to fluoride generation in an aluminium cell would benefit the operation and economics of an aluminium smelter. Past studies [2-6] have identified most of the important emission contributors to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation. Two sources were shown to be significant. The most studied source was primary HF generation. This is HF generation from electrolytic reactions between constituents of the fluoride based electrolyte and water from the fed alumina and hydrogen in the anode. Overlooked in some studies were generation reactions outside the electrolyte - defined in this study as secondary HF generation. This source was found to occur mainly from hydrolysis reactions with the generated particulate fluorides. However the results and the relative contributions from these studies are not strictly applicable to the current generation scenario. The present smelting practices and technology, dry scrubbing technology and raw material specifications differ substantially from those used during the period of each past investigation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify emission sources for the current smelter technology and practices. This used controlled laboratory based studies of the individual generation sources complemented by in plant studies analysing the HF emission from production aluminium electrolysis cells. It was shown that the main contributor to primary HF generation is the addition of water to the electrolyte from the feed alumina. This results in the cyclic short term variations in HF emission, which correlate to the rate of alumina addition to the cell. Laboratory and industrial studies show that only a fraction of the added water reacts. The water reacted is likely the structural water of the alumina. The adsorbed water is thought to be flashed off before addition to the bath. Depending on feeding technology and crust integrity, between 10 to 50% of this water can react. This produces 7 to 14 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the most significant emission component. The remainder of this structural water is either entrained in the anode gases or forms part of the electrolyte dissolved water content. Dissolved water generation is the second most significant primary generation contributor, and third most significant emission component. Dissolved water is in equilibrium with the alumina content of the bath. It represents a constant emission source. Depending on feeding technology and cell design, the emission can vary between 3 to 10 kgF/tonneAl. The final primary HF emission contributor results from electrolytic generation of the hydrogen content of the anode. Laboratory studies found the emission to have a reaction efficiency of approximately 10%. This results in a small emission, of 2 &#8211; 5 kg/tonneAl. The remainder of the hydrogen content is expected to be entrained in the anode gases, as the generation of this CO/CO2 mixture is an order of magnitude greater than the HF generation reaction. Secondary generation of hydrogen fluoride is also a significant HF emission source. In an industrial cell this results from mainly thermal hydrolysis of the particulate fluoride emissions at the crust&#8211;air interface. Laboratory studies have shown that other identified secondary emission sources are unlikely due to the ambient conditions and feeding practices in a modern prebake aluminium electrolysis cell. Hence previously proposed generation from hydrolysis of the particulates in the ducts and desorption of the surface fluoride from the fed secondary alumina, have been found to be insignificant compared to the main HF generation sources. The thermal hydrolysis emission contributor is the only significant secondary generation emission component. Industrial measurements show that it varies with ambient humidity and crust integrity, two parameters which vary constantly in a modern prebake anode cell. Measurements show that the emission from this source is responsible for 2 to 8 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the second highest HF emission component. Control of the crust condition and feeder hole states reduces this component significantly. Hence in a modern prebake aluminium cell, the most significant operational factors affecting emission are related mainly to secondary generation. Industrial measurements show that the long term variations in an emission result from changes in the ambient humidity and the cells crust cover. Control of the crust integrity is thus paramount in reducing such variations. This relates both to normal operation and batch operations. Reduction of all other sources of emission are a material composition problem. Simply reducing the water content (LOI(300) and LOI(1000)) and reducing the hydrogen content of the anodes will reduce the emission. However material considerations affect other aspects of cell operation and hence these factors are not as simple to adjust.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enfance et d&#233;racinement: Nathalie Sarraute, Romain Gary</field><field name="creator">Diver, Ruth Louise</field><field name="description">Cette th&#232;se examine les enjeux associ&#233;s au d&#233;racinement culturel v&#233;cu dans l&#8217;enfance et ses effets sur la cr&#233;ativit&#233; dans la vie adulte.

The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's experiment with prudential regulation : can disclosure discipline moderate excessive risk taking in New Zealand deposit taking institutions? : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Wilson, William Robert</field><field name="description">The New Zealand economy in the period up to 2006 provides an opportunity to assess an alternative disclosure based approach to the prudential regulation of deposittakers, in a market free of many of the distortions which arise from traditional regulatory schemes. The overall objective of this research has been to assess the effectiveness of the prudential regulation of New Zealand financial institutions and judge if the country is well served by it. Analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s registered bank sector suggests public disclosure adds value to New Zealand&#8217;s financial system. However, the significant relationship found between disclosure risk indicators and bank risk premiums was not as a result of market discipline, rather it is argued self-discipline was the mechanism, demonstrating bank management and directors are discharging their duties in a prudent manner. A feature of the New Zealand disclosure regime for banks is the significant responsibilities placed on bank directors; directors are then held accountable for their actions. Findings in the management of banks were in contrast to non-bank deposittakers, where disclosure was judged to be ineffective, and of no practical use due to its poor quality. The management of non-bank deposit-takers appeared to receive very little oversight from depositors, their trustees or official agencies. As a result, many appear to have managed their institution in their own interests, with little consideration given to other stakeholders. Failures which occurred in NBDTs from 2006 resulted from deficiencies in the prudential regulation of these deposit-takers, demonstrating the severity of asymmetric information and moral hazard problems which can arise if prudential regulation is not correctly designed and management interests are not aligned with other stakeholders. The New Zealand disclosure regime will never guarantee a bank will not fail, nor should it try to do so, but it should assist the functioning of a sound and efficient financial system. To this end, it is recommended that the Reserve Bank, in re-designing the regulatory framework for NBDTs, hold the management and directors of NBDTs similarly accountable, while also incorporating regular disclosure and minimum prudential standards. Governments have an important role to play in ensuring the financial system is efficient.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banks</field><field name="subject">Prudential regulation</field><field name="subject">Disclosure</field><field name="subject">Risk taking</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Banking state supervision</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing typozilla : an online application that appeals to gifted children : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Blachnitzky, Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis responds to the specific educational and social needs of gifted children within the context of online applications. Online enrichment activities and social opportunities are only successful if they are able to attract and sustain attention of the advanced interests of gifted children. The aim of the research is to design an online application that appeals to gifted children and recognises the identified intellectual and social needs within the New Zealand context. This was achieved through research through design by establishing a design strategy that uses the findings of investigations and applies them to a prototype application. Developers of online content for gifted children may benefit from this research. As an initial investigation a survey was conducted about how gifted New Zealand primary school children are using online applications. It was assumed following the literature review that online applications would appeal to gifted children if they teach a new skill, have multiplayer functionality and address higher order thinking skills. Basic design characteristics of the most popular gaming websites amongst gifted children (from the survey) were then used to inform the design strategy and to develop the prototype online application typozilla. Key findings were retrieved through observation of gifted children using typozilla. The majority of children observed were especially enthusiastic seeing other players&#8217; avatars within multiplayer areas and competing against each other. They enjoyed learning a new skill (which was touch-typing) and engaging in creative tasks. In interviews all gifted children confirmed that they perceived the typozilla design as appealing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational games design</field><field name="subject">typewriting</field><field name="subject">gifted children education</field><field name="subject">typing</field><field name="subject">typozilla</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of ethylene and auxin in responses of roots to phosphate supply in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) : a thesis presentation in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dinh, Phuong Thi Yen</field><field name="description">Phosphate (P) supply is one of the major determining factors to plant productivity, since the element affects the growth and the development of plants. In response to Pdeficiency treatment, plants display alterations in root system architecture caused by changes in primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) length and LR density. In this thesis, the root growth of the agronomically important legume, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was found to be slightly stimulated in terms of PR length, LR number and total LR length when plants were grown in a P-deficient media (0.01 mM orthophosphate; Pi) when compared with plants grown in a P-sufficient media (1.00 mM Pi) when using a hydroponic growth system. When plants are grown in a P-sufficient media, treatment with 100 nM exogenous 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and exogenous auxin (5 nM 1- naphthylacetic acid, NAA) resulted in significant increases in white clover PR length, LR number and LR length. However, when ethylene action or auxin transport were inhibited using 300 ppm 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and 100 nM 1-Nnaphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), respectively, root growth was significantly reduced which suggests roles for ethylene and auxin in mediating white clover root growth. To examine the effects of these hormones on plants grown in P-deficient media, 100 nM ACC treatment significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of growth on Pdeficient media only, while exposure of plants to P-deficiency alone was sufficient to significantly neutralise the inhibitory effects of 1-MCP on root growth. Hence, exposure to P-deficiency is proposed to increase either ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene sensitivity in white clover roots. In contrast, for plants grown in P-deficient media, treatment with 5 nM NAA significantly abolished the stimulation of white clover root growth observed with P-deficiency so it is proposed that exposure to Pdeficiency increases either auxin biosynthesis or auxin sensitivity, but the 5nM NAA concentration used was too high to stimulate root growth. Using DR5p::GUS transgenic white clover, auxin activity was found in the root tips and root primordia. Using these plants, it is suggested that P-deficient treatment and ACC treatment influenced white clover root growth through an increase in auxin sensitivity. Overall, ethylene and auxin are found to be essential in mediating white clover root growth in P-sufficiency, and also in mediating root responses to P-deficiency through changes in terms of the biosynthesis and the sensitivity of these two hormones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens L</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">auxin</field><field name="subject">phosphate</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music therapy for young children who have special needs : the music therapy experience from the perspectives of carers and professionals : thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Music Therapy at the New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Jenny Yu Kuan</field><field name="description">This project aims to investigate how carers and other professionals perceive the music therapy process over time. Music therapy has been used to address a wide range of diagnoses and developmental issues of young children. The research was conducted during my clinical placement working with young children who have been referred to a child development team. The participants in this project were carers with children with special needs. The children were diagnosed with various disabilities and required different support and developmental goals. Each child attended individual music therapy sessions once a week over a period of three to nine months. It was speculated  that many other changes or developmental progress could occur along with the goals and objectives set by me  in the  music therapy process. To understand fully what other changes or progress the children have made with the input of music therapy, the research was designed using open-ended interviews to find out what the carers and a professional witnessed during and in between the sessions. Three carers were involved in a one-on-one in-depth interview in which they were encouraged to talk about their observation and perception of music therapy. A speech-language therapist was also invited to participate in an in-depth interview. Data derived from the interviews was analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The findings compare themes generated from the clinical notes and interview data. The results showed some shared experiences amongst the participants as well as exceptions influenced by parental differences and the children&#8217;s conditions. Examination of the similarities and differences between the clinical notes and the interview data helped me validate the outcome of music therapy intervention and gain more insights into effective practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="subject">children with disabilities</field><field name="subject">disabled children</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How will Robocop communicate? : the design of a conceptual portable radio communication product for NZ police in 2018 : [a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington] EMBARGOED till 1 April 2011</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Frazer D</field><field name="description">This Master of Design study aims to communicate affective design principles within a Tait Electronics Ltd hand-held radio for the New Zealand Police to use in the year 2018. This investigation has three distinct research aims: A) Identify affective design principles appropriate for the design of current Tait portable police radios using the perceptual product experience (PPE) framework (Warell, 2008). B) Use speculative scenario planning to develop an understanding of how the requirements of Tait&#8217;s portable police radios will evolve over the next 10 years. C) Incorporate affective design principles and the brand values of Tait&#8217;s product range into a final conceptual portable police radio design for the year 2018. A comprehensive review of contemporary affective product design theory, case studies and other relevant literature was undertaken. This included affective product design (Warell, 2008), radio communication (Marzano, 2005) and future product forecasting (Lambourne, Feiz, &amp; Rigot, 1997). Following this review the following research methods were selected for this study: 1) Future scenario planning 2) Current product-user interviews 3) Passive product observations Throughout the project iterative design methods were used, including 2D concept generation, concept development and 3D prototyping. The resulting conceptual product and associated documentation of this study will add to the existing body of knowledge around the application of affective design principles and portable police radio product design.

Sub-topics also investigated were the motivators and drivers, the types of support received and the challenges associated with exporting. The exporter, not yet exporter and non-exporter formed the three groups for this study. A mixed-method approach utilising a postal survey and indepth face-to-face interviews provided the data and results for the main findings. Ten themes emerged from the survey results and assisted with interpreting the interviews. An original koru framework was presented throughout the thesis to portray the findings as they evolved. Networking was identified as the preferred internationalisation approach in this study. Of the ten themes, the uniqueness of a product was the most important driver to exporting. Maori tikanga was also relevant as a Maori business driver and presented challenges when Maori principles were incorporated with everyday mainstream practices. Maori tikanga was the only theme specific to the Maori participants, whereas the other nine aspects are likely to pertain to non- Maori businesses in this sector. &#8220;Strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; ties were integral to the participants&#8217; support infrastructure. However, government and its agencies were considered as being unhelpful to the smaller firm. Finance and exporting costs, followed by a lack of government assistance and incentives were the main export challenges for the participants. Another challenge for exporters were in finding suitable agents, contacts and distributors, whereas fluctuating exchange and interest rates were a problem for the not yet exporting group. A recommendation for Maori businesses is to continue creating unique products and to target international niche markets. Government needs to reassess their support policies and provide initiatives especially appropirate to micro and small businesses in the creative industries. There is also a need for government export agencies to better understand and market the uniqueness that Maori and their products offer to the international arena.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">creative industry</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The platforms : an examination of New Zealand Special Air Service campaigns from Borneo 'confrontation' to the Vietnam War, 1965-1971 : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Defence and Strategic Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand EMBARGOED until 31 January 2012</field><field name="creator">Ball, Rhys</field><field name="description">In 1955, the New Zealand Government authorised the creation of a Special Forces unit to operate with British counterparts in Malaya to defeat a communist-inspired guerrilla insurgency. Between 1956 and 1971 elements of the New Zealand Special Air Service (SAS) were deployed on active service four times. These operational deployments included periods of time in Malaya, Thailand, Borneo and South Vietnam. The research illustrates the chronological progression of the New Zealand SAS through two of its most influential active service campaigns by examining how commitments to the Borneo &#8216;Confrontation&#8217; in 1965 and 1966 directly and indirectly influenced the deployment to South Vietnam between December 1968 and February 1971. The mission of the New Zealand SAS in South Vietnam was to &#8216;assist in providing long range reconnaissance patrols&#8217; that would support the larger infantry elements in defeating the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army enemy. New Zealand SAS soldiers participated in 169 Australian SAS patrols in South Vietnam. Of those, 137 were commanded by the New Zealanders themselves. The research describes what the New Zealand SAS encountered during nearly two and a half years in South Vietnam; from the tactical intensity associated with small five-man patrols often observing or contacting much larger enemy formations, to the uncompromising professional standards that were expected of all members regardless of situation or circumstances and the influences of experienced Patrol Commanders, and the frustrations and inflexibility which characterised the relationship with their Australian counterparts. The research also further examines the underlying issue of overall strategic success and value of a small nationally-identifiable and strongly independent military unit that was compelled to operate under the command of larger Special Forces coalition counterparts and the impact different political, doctrinal, tactical cultural and cognitive characteristics had on these joint-operational deployments. The size of the New Zealand SAS contribution to the Australian SAS Squadron combined with the command arrangements placed upon it, also dictated that the deployments were never likely to be able to exert influence in any &#8216;independent&#8217; or nationally-identifiable sense, and the relationships, the types of patrol operations conducted, and the value of these operations, would ultimately see many New Zealand SAS veterans largely dissatisfied with the overall performance of the deployment. Nevertheless, the strength of New Zealand SAS operations in South Vietnam came from its practical application of unique New Zealand Special Forces methodology and field-craft which had been fundamentally shaped and developed in Borneo. The New Zealand SAS operations in South Vietnam and Borneo - the demonstration of the highest standards of patrol techniques, tracking, reconnaissance, ambushing and fire discipline, and above all, operational professionalism that has been the hallmark of New Zealand's military history &#8211; provided the evolutionary &#8216;platforms&#8217; from which today&#8217;s highly skilled and enviable New Zealand Special Forces have emerged.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Special Air Service</field><field name="subject">New Zealand SAS</field><field name="subject">Malaya</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Borneo</field><field name="subject">South Vietnam</field><field name="subject">military history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360204 Defence studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the conservation of New Zealand's threatened biodiversity : management, species recovery and legislation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Seabrook-Davison, Mark Nicholas Hawdon</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Seabrook-Davison, M.

The long storage and shipping times, low temperature (~0&#176;C) and high humidity (&gt;70 %RH) conditions require boxes manufactured from high performance corrugated fibreboard. As the corrugated fibreboard boxes are a significant expense, improvements to reduce the weight and therefore the cost of the corrugated fibreboard, while maintaining their vertical compression strength, would increase the apple and kiwifruit industries profitability Through analysis of the literature it was established that the greatest contributor to box compression strength was the corrugated fibreboard edgewise compression strength, which is significantly affected by moisture. The strength of corrugated fibreboard decreases with increasing moisture content, which tends to be high in low-temperature high-humidity cool-stores. The literature also indicated that temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium could be optimised to reduce the damage caused during the fluting process. The objectives of this study included improving box compression strength predictions by measuring the effect of moisture and temperature on the strength of the corrugated fibreboard and measuring the relationship between temperature, humidity and corrugated fibreboard moisture content. The objectives also included developing a mathematical model to optimise the operations preceding the fluting process by predicting the fluting medium moisture content and temperature just prior to the fluting process. The measurements of corrugated fibreboard properties enabled the widely known McKee&#8217;s equation to be modified to enable the prediction of box compression strength over a range of moisture contents (7 to 30 %db), the valves of which could be estimated using the moisture sorption isotherms developed in this study over the temperature and relative humidity range of 0 to 20&#176;C and 40 to 90 %RH. A mathematical model was developed to predict how the operation of the corrugator would affect the temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium just prior to the fluting process. The model was tested by running the corrugator at normal and extreme settings based on the model&#8217;s predictions, and measuring the strength properties of the corrugated fibreboard produced. The measured strength properties indicated that the machine speed and steam shower could have an effect but the too were inconsistent to established firm conclusions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrugated fibreboard</field><field name="subject">horticultural packaging</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290300 Manufacturing Engineering::290308 Packaging, storage and transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atomic resolution imaging in two and three dimensions</field><field name="creator">D'Alfonso, Adrian John</field><field name="description">This thesis explores theoretical aspects of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the comparison of simulation with experiment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), quantitative atomic resolution imaging, chemical mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formalising the informal: the commercialisation of GM cotton in Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Rana, Muhammad Ahsan</field><field name="description">Genetically modified insect-resistant (Bt) cotton is widely cultivated in Pakistan, although the Pakistani Government has yet to approve its commercial cultivation.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this study of persons with MS and their spousal carers residing in Australia during ten months of recruitment. Varied recruitment methods were used including the internet. 263 expressions of interest were received, and 203 survey packets were returned with usable data (77%). The demographic instrument and 4 scales measuring mood, reciprocity, life satisfaction and functional wellness were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. Results from the quantitative phase of the study supported many international epidemiological findings related to gender, age of onset, difficulty in obtaining a diagnosis in the light of vague early symptoms of MS, and high levels of depression in the study sample. The preliminary analysis suggested that these data should be analysed further in dyadic terms (a person with MS and their identified carer). Further inferential statistical analysis examined the data sub-set of &#8216;pairs only&#8217; which helped to inform formation of a pool of couples in caring relationships from which was selected a sub-sample of 12 spousal dyads residing in Victoria for interview in the second phase of the study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiple sclerosis, psychosocial aspects, concept of carepartnership, reciprocity and caring relationships, empathy and support of healthcare professionals as perceived by carepartners in MS, development of new facilitating role for people with MS, PwMS, review of healthcare model</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) crop response to light regimes in an agroforestry system</field><field name="creator">Varella, Alexandre Costa</field><field name="description">The general goal of this research was to understand the agronomic and physiological changes of a lucerne crop in distinct physical radiation environments and to verify the potential of lucerne to grow under shaded conditions. To achieve this, the research was conducted in four main steps: (i) firstly, experimental data collection in the field using two artificial shade materials (shade cloth and wooden slats) under inigated and non-irrigated conditions; (ii) a second experiment with data collection in a typical temperate dryland agroforestry area under non-irrigated conditions; (iii) generation of a light interception sub-model suitable for shaded crops and (iv) a linkage between the light interception sub-model and a canopy photosynthesis model for agroforestry use.  In experiments 1 and 2, lucerne crop was exposed to 6 different light regimes: full sunlight (FS), shade cloth (FS+CL), wooden slats (FS+SL), trees (T), trees+cloth (T +CL) and trees+slats (T+SL). The FS+SL structure produced a physical radiation environment (radiation transmission, radiation periodicity and spectral composition) that was similar to that observed in the agroforestry site (f). The mean annual photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was 41 % under the FS+CL, 44% under FS+SL and 48% under T compared with FS in clear sky conditions. Plants were exposed to an intermittent (sun/shade) regime under both FS+SL and T, whereas under FS+CL the shaded light regime was continuous. The red to far-red (RIFR) ratio measured during the shade period under the slats was 0.74 and under the trees was 0.64. However, R/FR ratio increased to 1.26 and 1.23 during the illuminated period under FS+SL and T, respectively, and these were equivalent to the ratio of 1.28 observed under the FS+CL and 1.31 in FS. The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of shoots increased under the 5 shaded treatments compared with full sunlight. The pattern of radiation interception was unchanged by radiation flux, periodicity and spectral composition and all treatments had a mean extinction coefficient of 0.82. However, the magnitude of the decrease in canopy growth was less than those in PPFD transmissivity. The mean lucerne annual dry matter (DM) yield was 17.5 t ha&#8315;&#185; in FS and 10 t ha&#8315;&#185; under the FS+CL, FS+SL and T regimes. This declined to 3.4 t DM ha&#8315;&#185; under T+CL (22% PPFD transmissvity) and 4.1 t DM ha&#8315;&#185; under T+SL (23% transmissivity). A similar pattern of response was observed for leaf net photosynthesis (Pn) rates under the shade treatments compared with full sun. In addition, spectral changes observed under the trees and slats affected plant motphology by increasing the number of long stems, stem height and internode length compared with full sunlight. Thus, there were two main explanations for the increase in RUE under shade compared with full sun: (i) preferential partition of assimilates to shoot rather than root growth and/or (ii) leaves under shade were still operating at an efficient part of the photosynthetic light curve.  The changes proposed for the canopy Pn model were appropriate to simulate the radiation environment of an agroforestry system. However, the model underestimated DM yields under the continuous and intermittent shade regimes. These were considered to be mainly associated with plant factors, such as overestimation in maintenance respiration and partitioning between shoots and roots in shade and the intermittency light effect on leaf Pn rates. Further investigation in these topics must be addressed to accurately predict crop yield in agroforestry areas. Overall, the lucerne crop responded typically as a sun-adapted plant under shade. It was concluded that lucerne yield potential to grow under intermediate shade was superior to most of C3 pastures previously promoted in the literature.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alfalfa</field><field name="subject">fluctuating light</field><field name="subject">light intensity</field><field name="subject">light quality</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">shade and silvopastoral system</field><field name="subject">lucerne crops</field><field name="subject">Medicago sativa L.</field><field name="subject">agroforestry</field><field name="subject">Total Dry Matter (TDM)</field><field name="subject">radiation use efficiency</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic petrology and geochemistry of the tertiary formations at Meulaboh area, west Aceh Basin, Sumatra, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Hadiyanto,</field><field name="description">The West Aceh Basin is one of several Indonesian Tertiary forearc basins which contain a thick sedimentary succession of coal-bearing rocks that were deposited during the Oligocene to Pliocene. The continued subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate under continental Sundaland was responsible for the development of this asymmetrical, tectonically-active forearc basin which is located along the west coast of the Aceh region of northwestern Sumatra. Significant petroleum discoveries have not been found in any Indonesian forearc basin and this study was initiated to assess the hydrocarbon generation potential of the West Aceh Basin and to formulate a model to aid future exploration in this and other forearc basins. The type, abundance and maturity of organic matter in the Tertiary sequence was determined using optical microscopy and geochemical techniques. The organic matter in both coals and clastic rocks is derived from land plants with a minor algal component in some of the claystones and shales. The coals, ranging in age from Oligocene to Pliocene, are dominated by vitrinite with lesser liptinite and only very minor inertinite. A distinctive feature of the coals is the abundance of exsudatinite, resinite, suberinite and cutinite. Using optical properties and textural features, exsudatinite can be divided into two groups and much of this secondary maceral is derived from resinite and suberinite. The significance of exsudatinite as an indicator of petroleum generation is discussed.Dispersed organic matter (DOM) in the clastic rocks comprises mostiy liptinite with lesser vitrinite and only minor inertinite. The rocks contain small but significant quantities of bitumen which indicate migration of hydrocarbons through the rocks or in situ generation of hydrocarbons.The coal and clastic rocks are potential source rocks but most are immature and have not produced significant liquid hydrocarbons. Use of a modified petrographic scoring system shows that of the clastic rocks, the Tangla Formation shales and to a lesser extent, the Kueh Formation, are the best source rocks. The Oligocene coal, and possibly the Miocene coal, have very good hydrocarbon generation potential. The onshore vitrinite reflectance gradients are greater than those offshore and thus the oil window is predicted to be shallower in the onshore areas. Geochemical data confirms the source rock potential of the rocks although the organic matter is mostly Type III or transitional Type II/III using the 1984 classification of Tissot and Welte. The shale contain 1 to 5 % Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Rock Eval data show that the organic matter in the shale and coal is oil to gas prone witii Hydrogen Indices (HI) of less than 200 to 465. S2 values are highest in the Tangla Formation but lowest in the Tutut Formation. . Samples from the..Tangla Formation contain the highest extractable hydrocarbons (mgHC/gTOC) although petrographic data suggest that this is due to bitumen impregnation. Pyrolysis-GC traces of these Oligocene and Miocene coals are characterised by a high abundance of normal alkane hydrocarbons. In many respects, the pyrograms are similar to those of the Talang Akar coal which are known source rocks.Future exploration should be directed towards the onshore areas or those offshore areas where the sequence is thick and the potential for intersecting the oil window is greater. Areas of greatest interest would those which contain coal and carbonaceosu shale as these lithologies have the greatest source rock potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An enigma: barriers to the identification of gifted students with a learning disability</field><field name="creator">Wormald, Catherine</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to understand the barriers to the identification of gifted students with a learning disability. Gifted students with a learning disability are an enigma within schools and are underrepresented in programs for gifted students. The benefits to students, families and teachers of appropriate programs for gifted students with a learning disability have been well documented. This study employed a mixed method of research and consisted of two phases which ran concurrently. In Phase 1 teachers from New South Wales Department of Education (NSW DET) schools, Sydney Catholic Education Office (CEO) schools in a metropolitan Sydney School Education Area, and an independent Kindergarten to Year 12 school were surveyed using the Survey of Practices with Students of Varying Needs (SOP). The schools included selective high schools, schools with opportunity classes as well as mainstream classes, comprehensive high schools and mainstream primary schools. A number of teachers were also interviewed. In Phase 2 multiple case studies were undertaken. The participants consisted of students who were identified as gifted with a learning disability, their families and willing professionals they had consulted. Documents, results from various assessments and intervention programs, as well as reports from school counsellors, psychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, paediatricians and other educational consultants were provided and analysed. Students and their families were then interviewed. The results of the research showed that teachers have knowledge of, and a positive attitude towards gifted students but are ambivalent towards students with other special needs. Teachers also demonstrated substantial confusion and conflict about their understanding of gifted students, their educational needs and their responsibility to these students and also students with special needs. There was virtually no understanding of gifted students with a learning disability. The results indicated that identification of these students is occurring through the efforts of the parents and that there is minimal recognition and support from the schools. All the students have had negative experiences with respect to their schooling. Finally it was recommended that an identification protocol be established in schools based on the information provided by the parents of the participants in this study. In addition teachers need to be provided with comprehensive training in this field and support from the decision makers across all sectors of education. Furthermore additional extensive research needs to be undertaken on gifted students with a learning disability. Specific research needs to be completed into the effectiveness of an instrument specifically designed for teachers focused on gifted students with a learning disability in order to asses the effectiveness of an identification protocol and in addition research on the social and emotional issues for these students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mythological state and its empire</field><field name="creator">Grant, David John, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">legitimate because it is not the persistence of a secularised theological concept. Although it reoccupied mirror-image pre-Enlightenment questions, say regarding absolutism, it is not first concerned with such categories as ???sovereignty, raison d???etat, will, decision, friend-enemy??? but with ???contract, consent, liberty, law and rights???. However, in Work on Myth, he proposes that man is, and has always been, a maker of mythological magnitudes, of which there can be argued to be an archetypal form. These magnitudes are so fearsome as to allow man to convert his existential fear into fear of an entity the fate of which he can gradually bring into his own hands. In this way, there is the promise of the elimination of existential fear and of the experience of sympathetic conditions of existence. Blumenberg does not address political issues, such as the nature of the State. However, if the State can be shown to be such a magnitude and therefore a political realisation of such an archetype, then it is mythological and so is not modern, even if it is legitimate. It then needs to be criticised to allow the introduction of a radical notion of Enlightenment. The effect of such criticisms would be the replacement of the notions of fear and sympathy with that of self-responsibility as the first interest of the State. Selfresponsibility would need to be promoted progressively. It would require a reconfigured State the prime purpose of which is the promotion of respect and self-reliance of individuals. Its first concern would therefore not be the elimination of fear, which would be understood as unable to be eliminated, nor the creation by it of sympathetic conditions of existence, which would be better a matter for properly prepared and supported, selfreliant individuals. The debate then would be around this axis, where contingency is accepted and managed, not the mythological axis of liberalism and republicanism which has dominated modern political theory since Hobbes. This thesis is first an exploration of the viability of the mythological idea of the State, whether the State is a political realisation of the archetypal myth. It does this through an examination of such thinkers in the political tradition as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, Rawls and Pettit. The conclusion of this examination is, in sum, that the idea of the State since Hobbes has been, and remains, mythological since it shows all the key characteristics of a mythological entity and the arguments for it have mythological presumptions. It is still first concerned with the fear/sympathy nexus and the debates of the political tradition from Hobbes to Pettit have been carried out around that axis. Further, this is argued to be an arrangement which promotes dominant interests rather than widespread participation of non-autonomous, self-responsible individuals. But if this notion of the State as a progressively refined and dispersed mythological entity is viable, it cannot have existed only in the minds of those in the political theoretical tradition. We should expect to see evidence of it in the beliefs and practices of individual  men and women. It must have been not just a political realisation of the mythological State as an idea, but an embodied notion. This thesis is also an exploration of the evidence for that embodiment. It does this by looking at Elias??? analysis of the civilising process in the Middle Ages, at Foucault???s analysis of the emergence and proliferation of the disciplines and the art of government from the 17th century and at the dispersal of the myth through cultural imperialism in the 18th century. The conclusions of these analyses are reinforced by the social ontology of Wittgenstein. Further argument for this embodiment is presented regarding both the common notion of citizenship and the perception of other cultures, that each manifest mythological characteristics. Such embodied practices can be seen as strategies promoted through the State by dominant interests, the purpose of which are the claims to generally eliminate fear and create sympathetic conditions of existence. This embodiment reinforces the initial argument that the idea of the State did emerge and has been established and gradually refined as mythological. In essence and in large part, this is a genealogy of post-Hobbesian political society as mythological. That is, as the political realisation of the archetypal mythological form and its embodiment in the material practice of individuals. The explanatory value of this way of perceiving the State is then demonstrated by its application to the complex conditions of the destruction of traditional Aboriginal culture by the colonising and civilising British, that is the dispersal of the mythological State as empire. From this, it is argued that the mythological understanding of the State is more illuminating that other approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State, The</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem frames approach to strategic requirements for web services</field><field name="creator">Jha, Anju, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web Services can be seen from two views ? one that it is a purely technological advance and the other that it is a capability that an organisation can deploy to meet a business objective. Much has been said about the first view but not much has been said about the second view. The underlying premise of this research is that in the context of an ever-increasing competitive environment, an organisation needs to take into account these important aspects: What is the business strategy of the organisation, which adopts Web Services? Does the IT align with the business strategy of the organisation? The aim of this research is to capture and describe business-IT problems in the context of strategic requirements and Web Services. As a means to align a Web Services initiative with business strategy, we propose a Requirements Engineering framework to capture the business objectives of an organisation from strategy to implementation. The methodology that we propose provides a roadmap from business strategy, to the strategic objectives to implementation in four dimensions: innovation, customer relationship management, infrastructure management and financials. The proposed framework extends the e-Business Modelling Ontology (eBMO) of Pigneur and Osterwalder by applying Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems to understand the strategic objectives and the business context.  We have presented 2 examples as proof of concept. We have experimented with our methodology on Amazon.com and Dell.com ?cases developed from the literature? as these organisations are aggressively pursuing Web Services as a part of their IT and business strategy. We use the Problem Frames approach to capture the business objectives and the problem context of an organisation deploying Web Services and to create a strategic alignment between the business strategy and the information technology. The approach presented in this thesis is used to understand Amazon and Dell?s strategy and strategic objectives. It was possible to capture strategic objectives and the strategic context through combination of the eBMO and Progression of Problems. It was also possible to trace this to Web Services requirement description through application of Problem Frames. The framework combines with Bleistein et al?s Progression of Problems at the strategic level and applies Problem Frames at the operational level. It takes the problem-oriented view of the whole process, but does not apply Problem Frames throughout, at least not in their original formulation by Jackson.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services.</field><field name="subject">Business strategy series.</field><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and investigation of local optima in aerospace structural design</field><field name="creator">Shi, Jianming, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on research into the causes of local optima when optimization algorithms are applied to aerospace structural design. A thorough understanding of local optima will enable the engineers to select the algorithm for optimization or to guide the optimization to ensure either global optima or near optimal solutions are achieved. Therefore, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted and several illustrative examples have been identified to help fully understand the cause and importance of local optima. The first application involved the design of the internal structure of a simplified wing spoiler. MSC.NASTRAN was used to optimize each discretized location of an additional rib with the aid of a Patran Command Language (PCL) algorithm. The objective function of minimum weight was approximated as a multimodal function in a 2D smooth curve where the local and global optima were identified. The theory of continuous rectangular plates was used to explain the phenomena. The second problem considered buckling of a wing rib. A PCL code was written to obtain the rib buckling factors as the position of the center of a square cutout was varied within a constrained area. The rib linear buckling factor versus the centre position O(X, Y) of the square cutout was plotted in a 3D surface contour plot. Load path theory and relevant plate buckling theories were used to explain the local and global maxima identified. The final example considered the maximization of the buckling load of a simply supported composite laminated plate under in-plane loading. A conventional Genetic Algorithm was used to examine the local and global optima of the critical buckling load factor. Many local and global optima were identified and explained and many near-optimal solutions were found in a single run. A significant understanding of local optima in aerospace structural design with the optimal utilization of available software and the appropriate selection of optimization algorithms has been achieved. Further work could either include implementing the proposed global optimization strategies or include implementing rapid methods for identifying multiple local optima.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerospace engineering</field><field name="subject">structural -- computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite horizon robust state estimation for uncertain finite-alphabet hidden Markov models</field><field name="creator">Xie, Li, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we consider a robust state estimation problem for discrete-time, homogeneous, first-order, finite-state finite-alphabet hidden Markov models (HMMs). Based on Kolmogorov's Theorem on the existence of a process, we first present the Kolmogorov model for the HMMs under consideration. A new change of measure is introduced. The statistical properties of the Kolmogorov representation of an HMM are discussed on the canonical probability space. A special Kolmogorov measure is constructed. Meanwhile, the ergodicity of two expanded Markov chains is investigated.  In order to describe the uncertainty of HMMs, we study probability distance problems based on the Kolmogorov model of HMMs. Using a change of measure technique, the relative entropy and the relative entropy rate as probability distances between HMMs, are given in terms of the HMM parameters. Also, we obtain a new expression for a probability distance considered in the existing literature such that we can use an information state method to calculate it.  Furthermore, we introduce regular conditional relative entropy as an a posteriori probability distance to measure the discrepancy between HMMs when a realized observation sequence is given. A representation of the regular conditional relative entropy is derived based on the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Then a recursion for the regular conditional relative entropy is obtained using an information state method.  Meanwhile, the well-known duality relationship between free energy and relative entropy is extended to the case of regular conditional relative entropy given a sub-[special character]-algebra. Finally, regular conditional relative entropy constraints are defined based on the study of the probability distance problem. Using a Lagrange multiplier technique and the duality relationship for regular conditional relative entropy, a finite horizon robust state estimator for HMMs with regular conditional relative entropy constraints is derived. A complete characterization of the solution to the robust state estimation problem is also presented.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">hidden Markov models (HMM)</field><field name="subject">Kolmogorov</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">posteriori</field><field name="subject">probability</field><field name="subject">robust state estimator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diverse organisation : operational considerations for managing organisational information resources</field><field name="creator">Dowse, Andrew, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sharing and exploitation of information resources across a diverse organisation can confer a significant competitive advantage but also can be a substantial challenge in coordinating across structural and specialisation boundaries. This challenge reflects the difficulties traditionally associated with lateral relations, which were recognised by classical organisational theorists but are more pronounced with the emergence of information as a critical resource. Notwithstanding the benefits of information sharing across the organisation, the classical concept of specialisation remains fundamental to organisational theory; thus there is potential for friction between requirements for specialisation and coordination. This research therefore examines information management arrangements to balance specialisation and coordination in a diverse organisation.  The research takes advantage of organisational and systems theory literature to appreciate complex information management requirements in terms of differentiation/cohesion and integration/coupling of organisational elements. Information management???s business and technology perspectives define the conceptual framework, within which gaps in the literature are identified and become the focus of the research. The two key research areas are the opportunities enabled by technology for business integration through collaborative decision-making and the management of organisation-wide information technology infrastructure. Collaborative decision-making is an integrating mechanism that can provide balance between specialisation and coordination contingent upon the nature of decision tasks and their organisational context. Propositions associated with an adaptive approach to collaborative decision-making were tested in laboratory experiments, with positive support for the contingency model albeit constrained by individual cognitive variances.  Organisations increasingly are adopting centralised approaches to the provision of IT services, with IT governance as an integrating mechanism and a need for multiple business-IT alignments to add value according to the differentiation required by organisational elements. Propositions relating to the adaptation of IT management arrangements based upon organisational characteristics were tested using a multi- iv -discipline approach, which resulted in support for the model although practical difficulties were experienced in the action research component.  This research provides a framework for maintaining effective variety of information capabilities commensurate with the diverse organisation???s mission and environment, while also exploiting the synergies and economies of shared information resources for holistic benefits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">information technology management</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">collaborative decision making</field><field name="subject">ommunication</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of knitting and preforming parameters on mechanical properties of weft knitted glass/epoxy composites</field><field name="creator">Tran, Luu, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Weft knitted composites have a very complex reinforcement structure which affects their mechanical behaviour.

Information on the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall plays an important role in the process of surface runoff generation. Hence it is important for a variety of applications in hydrology and water resources management. The spatial variability of rainfall can be substantial even for very small catchments and an important factor in the reliability of rainfall-runoff simulations. Catchments in urban areas usually are small, and the management problems often require the numerical simulation of catchment processes and hence the need to consider the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall. A need exists, therefore, to analyse the sensitivity of rainfall-runoff behaviour of catchment modelling systems (CMS) to imperfect knowledge of rainfall input, in order to judge whether or not they are reliable and robust, especially if they are to be used for operational purposes. Development of a methodology for identification of storm events according to the degree of heterogeneity in space and time and thence development of a detailed spatial and temporal rainfall model within a hydroinformatic environment utilising real-time data has been the focus of this project. The improvement in runoff prediction accuracy and hence the importance of the rainfall input model in runoff prediction is then demonstrated through the application of a CMS for differing variability of real storm events to catchments with differing orders of scale. The study identified both spatial and temporal semi-variograms, which were produced by plotting the semi-variance of gauge records in space and time against distance and time respectively. These semi-variograms were utilised in introducing estimators to measure the degree of heterogeneity of each individual storm events in their space and time scale. Also, the proposed estimators use ground based gauge records of the real storm events and do not rely on delicate meteorological interpretations. As the results of the investigation on the developed semi-variogram approach, real storm events were categorised as being High Spatial-High Temporal (HS-HT); High Spatial-Low Temporal; (HS-LT); Low Spatial-High Temporal (LS-HT); and Low Spatial-Low Temporal variability.A comparatively detailed rainfall distribution model in space and time was developed within the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The enhanced rainfall representation in both space and time scale is made feasible in the study by the aid of the powerful spatial analytic capability of GIS. The basis of this rainfall model is an extension of the rainfall model developed by Luk and Ball (1998) through a temporal discretisation of the storm event. From this model, improved estimates of the spatially distributed with smaller time steps hyetographs suited for especially the urban catchments could be obtained. The importance of the detailed space-time rainfall model in improving the robustness of runoff prediction of CMS was investigated by comparing error parameters for predictions from CMS using alternate rainfall models, for various degrees of spatiotemporal heterogeneity events. Also it is appropriate to investigate whether the degree of this improvement to be dependent on the variability of the storm event which is assessed by the adopted semi-variogram approach. From the investigations made, it was found that the spline surface rainfall model, which considered the spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall in greater detail than the Thiessen rainfall model resulted in predicted hydrographs that more closely duplicated the recorded hydrograph for the same parameter set. The degree of this improvement in the predicted hydrograph was found to be dependent on the spatial and temporal variability of the storm event as measured by the proposed semi-variogram approach for assessing this feature of a storm event. The analysis is based on forty real events recorded from the Centennial Park Catchment (1.3km2) and the Upper Parramatta River Catchment (110km2) in Sydney, Australia. These two case study catchments were selected to ensure that catchment scale effects were incorporated in the conclusions developed during the study.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Watershed management -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Runoff -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting and preventing the spread of lantana into the Blue Mountains</field><field name="creator">Gold, Daniel Alexander, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Invasive weeds inflict significant harm on native species, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbance regimes.  When managing these weed threats, some of the most useful tools are the outputs of predictive distribution models.  As they supplement existing distribution data to assess where in the landscape is most susceptible to weed invasion, they allow for more efficient weed management because the areas most suited to weed species may be targeted for control.	This research develops a habitat suitability model for the weed lantana (Lantana camara L. sensu lato) in a portion of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area at present and under forecast warmer climates.  A generalised additive model (GAM) is used, which fits the regression curve used for prediction to the calibration data themselves and allows for an exploration of which environmental conditions favour lantana as well as where in the landscape is most suitable for the weed.  Temperature was positively correlated with suitable habitat and explained over 90% of the variation in lantana presence predicted by the model.  15% of the study area was found to be suitable for lantana at present, with this figure reaching 58% after a simulated 3??C rise in temperature.  Mapping habitat suitability across the study area allowed for the identification of five distinct pathways for lantana to further invade the Blue Mountains.	Responding to calls for the integration of weed management with biodiversity conservation, the research also integrates the habitat suitability model with information regarding the distribution of vegetation communities and endangered species in the Blue Mountains.  Thirteen native vegetation communities were found to have more than 20% suitable habitat for lantana at present, and an additional three contained more than 80% suitable habitat after a simulated 3??C rise in temperature.  Five of these communities are listed as threatened under relevant legislation and harbour at least 27 endangered species, placing additional urgency on their conservation.  	This research has successfully used modelling techniques to identify areas for targeted weed management integrated with biodiversity conservation.  The methods are easily adaptable to other weeds and regions and could thus be used to illustrate the comprehensive threat weeds pose to Australia???s biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="subject">Species distribution modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction-oxidation cycling of metal oxides for hydrogen production</field><field name="creator">Sim, Andrew Gregory, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A process for the production of clean hydrogen from methane based upon the sequential reduction and oxidation of metal oxides has been studied. The original process, based on iron oxide, suffers from significant disadvantages including deactivation by sintering and coke deposition. Improvement of the iron based system and identification and development of alternative metal oxides for hydrogen production has formed the basis of this study. The literature review outlines current methods for hydrogen production, followed by a review of the Steam-Iron Process as an improved and simpler method for clean hydrogen production. Thermodynamic assessment shows Fe3O4/FeO/Fe, WO3/WO2/W and SnO2/SnO/Sn to be the most prospective systems for the Steam-Metal Process. Experimental testing showed that Fe and W based systems were suitable for hydrogen production, but Sn based systems were unsuitable due to poor reducibility using methane. Attention was then focused on the addition of CeO2/ZrO2 promoters to Fe and W based systems in order to improve reactivity and prevent catalyst deactivation. CeO2/ZrO2 promoted Fe2O3 showed improved redox reactivity and increased stability, with formation of FeO. This aided in mitigation of sintering and introduced the possibility of prevention of coking, as catalysed by methane decomposition over fully reduced Fe metal.  Although WO3 was found to be a suitable oxide, complete reduction to tungsten metal resulted in the formation of tungsten carbide and contamination of hydrogen produced. The formation of 31mol% [CeO2/ZrO2] / 69 mol% WO3 showed stabilised reduction using methane, allowing for redox cycling of the WO3-WO2 couple and preventing complete reduction to W metal. The use of the doped metal oxide showed the best performance of all the metal oxides tested, with clean hydrogen production over multiple redox cycles and high metal oxide stability. Further kinetic studies of both the reduction and oxidation reactions show reduction is chemical reaction controlled process (WO3/WO2.9 &#8594; WO2) with an apparent activation energy of 142 ?? 3 kJ/mol. Oxidation is also fitted to a chemically controlled process, with a reaction rate expression derived as:  rH2 = [0.064 + (F x 0.00038)].e^(-108750/8.314xT).[PH2O]^(0.75)  The apparent activation energy for oxidation was calculated as 109 ?? 1 kJ/mol.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrogen Production</field><field name="subject">Steam Iron Process</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in opioid drug related death</field><field name="creator">Zador , Deborah , Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Opioid drug related death is the topic of this thesis.

The rationale behind TTTT was ???negotiated safety???: that it was safe not to use condoms for anal sex in primary relationships if specific steps were followed. TTTT generated contestation within AIDS Councils in Australia and New Zealand, but also amongst researchers, policy makers and gay communities. Arguments about TTTT and negotiated safety appeared logical and reasonable and did not fall neatly along an Australia/New Zealand divide. This study used a qualitative approach to interview key HIV educators in New South Wales who were involved in the development of TTTT and New Zealand educators who did not promote negotiated safety. This thesis argues that in order to understand the contestation around negotiated safety and TTTT it is necessary to understand the broader social and historical factors that shape HIV prevention contexts and practice. These include factors arising from the epidemic itself (which, to some extent, were responsible for the difference between Australia and New Zealand) such as the increasing complexity of gay men???s risk reduction strategies, the rise of a positive voice, and impact of treatments and factors associated with and the broader context such as the rise and continuing history of a gay political and social movement and associated identity and community formation, and later, fragmentation, changing concepts of love, intimacy and relationships and of risk and the uncertainty, anxiety and fear from living in a complex individualised detraditionalised world. This approach will show that a focus on a dynamic epidemic, and the broader social and historical context can shed light on arguments made about negotiated safety and TTTT. Further, applying Bourdieu???s formulation of the complex interaction of habitus, fields and practice (1977) makes sense not only of the arguments made about negotiated safety and TTTT, but of educator practice and of HIV prevention, of the broader HIV and AIDS sector, and of how societies continue to learn to live with and adapt to the epidemic.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV prevention</field><field name="subject">Social history</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected adults: prevention and management of long term toxicities</field><field name="creator">Calmy, Alexandra , Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The spectrum of drugs used in HIV-infected patients has dramatically changed since triple antiretroviral combinations were introduced, albeit at the expense of some severe adverse events, in 1996. Long term complications of antiretroviral drug exposure, such as HIV lipodystrophy, as well as organ-specific disease of heart and bone are, therefore, a critical issue when designing antiretroviral regimens. Because it is difficult to predict the occurrence of lipodystrophy, and because there is no therapeutic agents able to combat lipodystrophy once established, avoidance of thymidine nucleoside analogues remains the most useful strategy to prevent and treat lipoatrophy; although this approach can worsen dyslipidaemia. Metabolic syndrome can and should be assessed as it predicts type 2 diabetes as well as cardiovascular events in HIV-infected individuals. Ongoing HIV replication is a risk factor for serious non-AIDS events including cardiovascular disease, as well as for AIDS. Therefore, HIV RNA suppression is imperative in all patients requiring antiretroviral therapy. Finally, HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy, particularly in those receiving a boosted protease inhibitor, have a high prevalence of low bone mineral density.

An integrated approach to field investigation was utilised in this study, including sample collection from a network of standard and bundled piezometers, surface and borehole geophysical investigation techniques, and a manometer board for the measurement of hydraulic head in bundled piezometers. Nine groundwater sampling events were conducted over a 12 month period, with sample analyses comprising field measurement of water quality parameters and redox sensitive elements, and laboratory analysis for major and trace elements and stable isotopes (??18O, ??2H, ??13C-DIC, ??15N). The vertical position of the centre of mass of the leachate plume was observed to vary up to 2 metres between monitoring events, and concentrations of key indicator parameters were observed to fluctuate by as much as 160%. The electrical images created by surface resistivity transects along a groundwater flow path between the landfill and a groundwater-fed pond a short distance downgradient suggest a plume configuration characterised by discrete pulses of concentrated leachate migrating in a conservative manner between the landfill and the pond. It is hypothesized that these leachate slugs are flushed into the aquifer during sustained periods of rainfall, presumed to be a significant driver of leachate mobilisation into the underlying aquifer. The most significant hydrogeochemical processes affecting contaminant mobilisation, transport and attenuation in the leachate-impacted shallow aquifer included microbial degradation of organic waste, dissolution of inorganic waste, ion exchange, precipitation of sulfide and carbonate minerals, mixing with rainfall recharge along flow path, and redox transformations along the plume fringe. These processes are supported by hydrogeochemical data analysis, and generally agree with the results of inverse geochemical modelling. While analysis of detailed groundwater monitoring appears to provide a plausible description of the plume dynamics, the results of the electrical resistivity transects indicates a more varied and complex plume configuration than is suggested by the borehole data alone. This integration of investigation techniques underscores the inherent inadequacy of even a high-resolution monitoring well network to accurately describe the full extent of variation in time and space within a contaminant plume, even in a relatively simple aquifer environment, and accentuates the potentially significant limitations of site-scale hydrogeochemical interpretation based solely on borehole monitoring data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">plumes (Fluid dynamics).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality and the prediction of work performance: artificial neural networks versus linear regression</field><field name="creator">Minbashian, Amirali, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research that has evaluated the effectiveness of personality variables for predicting work performance has predominantly relied on methods designed to detect simple relationships. The research reported in this thesis employed artificial neural networks ??? a method that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear and configural relationships among variables ??? and the findings were compared to those obtained by the more traditional method of linear regression. Six datasets that comprise a range of occupations, personality inventories, and work performance measures were used as the basis of the analyses. A series of studies were conducted to compare the predictive performance of prediction equations that a) were developed using either artificial neural networks or linear regression, and b) differed with respect to the type and number of personality variables that were used as predictors of work performance. Studies 1 and 2 compared the two methods using individual personality variables that assess the broad constructs of the five-factor model of personality. Studies 3 and 4 used combinations of these broad variables as the predictors. Study 5 employed narrow personality variables that assess specific facets of the broad constructs. Additional methodological contributions include the use of a resampling procedure, the use of multiple measures of predictive performance, and the comparison of two procedures for developing neural networks. Across the studies, it was generally found that the neural networks were rarely able to outperform the simpler linear regression equations, and this was attributed to the lack of reliable nonlinearity and configurality in personality-work performance relationships. However, the neural networks were able to outperform linear regression in the few instances where there was some independent evidence of nonlinear or configural relationships. Consequently, although the findings do not support the  usefulness of neural networks for specifically improving the effectiveness of personality variables as predictors of work performance, in a broader sense they provide some grounds for optimism for organisational researchers interested in applying this method to investigate and exploit complex relationships among variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental investigation of the effects of pupil responding and teacher reacting on pupil achievement.</field><field name="creator">Hughes, David Christopher</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz//handle/10092/3530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The immunogenetics of common variable immunodeficiency / Charles Grenfell Mullighan.</field><field name="creator">Mullighan, Charles Grenfell</field><field name="description">Includes bibliography.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">616.09/9 21</field><field name="subject">Immunogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Immunodeficiency.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating bacterial biofilms in chronic Rhinosinusitis : an in vitro study, in vivo animal study and a examination of biofilms in human CRS.</field><field name="creator">Kien, Ha Rach</field><field name="description">Introduction Bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). This thesis consists of a number of separate studies. The results of each study were designed to help provide an evolution of knowledge that could be applied to our subsequent investigations on the topic of bacterial biofilms and chronic rhinosinusitis. In vitro studies were utilized to document the capacity of CRS bacteria to form biofilms as well as to investigate the efficacy of various antimicrobials at high concentrations. Additionally, an in vivo sheep model was developed to examine different biofilm detection techniques. Finally, a study of CRS patients was conducted to investigate the incidence of biofilm related sinus disease. Methods Our in vitro studies used 96 well crystal violet microtiter plate assays to determine the biofilm growth characteristics of S.aureus isolated from patients with CRS. Established biofilms were then subjected various antimicrobial agents, and the degree of biofilm reduction calculated to examine their potential for sinus biofilm treatment. A sheep sinusitis model involved performing endoscopic sinus surgery, occlusion of frontal sinus ostia and the introduction of bacteria. Mucosal specimens were subsequently examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). CSLM was also used in a prospective study to document the presence bacterial biofilms on the mucosa of patients with CRS compared to controls. Results The findings of in vitro experiments revealed that not all isolates were capable of forming biofilms. Of the antibiotics tested, only Mupirocin was capable of reducing biofilm mass by 90% in all isolates. The animal model showed considerable variation in biofilm detection rates. The CSLM biofilm detection rate was 100% in obstructed sinuses with bacteria introduced, whereas TEM detected only 66%. Both these objective measures failed to identify biofilms in control groups. SEM found biofilms in all experimental groups including controls. CSLM analysis of CRS patients found Bacterial biofilms in 44% and no biofilms in controls. Conclusion The demonstration of biofilms in the sheep model for sinusitis and biofilms on the mucosal specimens of patients with CRS, and the ability of bacteria in CRS to form biofilms in vitro, further supports the hypothesis that biofilms play a role in the pathogenesis of CRS. CSLM is the modality of choice in documenting the presence of bacterial biofilms on sinus mucosal surfaces due to the inherent flaws of sampling error and subjectivity of TEM and SEM. Finally, CRS is a multi-factorial disease, topical Mupirocin via nasal irrigation may be a therapeutic option in patients with likely S.aureus biofilms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic rhinosinusitis; biofilms; CRS; bacterial biofilms;in-vitro; in-vivo</field><field name="subject">sinusitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the role of substance P in acute ischaemic stroke.</field><field name="creator">Turner, Rene&#769;e Jade</field><field name="description">More than 15 million people worldwide will suffer a stroke each year two thirds will die or be left permanently disabled. Accordingly, stroke represents an enormous financial burden on the community, due to the cost of hospitalisation, treatment and rehabilitation of stroke patients. Despite the significance of this public health problem, a safe and widely applicable stroke therapeutic remains elusive. Cerebral oedema is widely recognised as a common and often fatal complication of stroke that is associated with worsened outcome. However, the exact mechanisms of oedema formation remain unclear, with current therapies largely ineffective in addressing the mechanisms of cerebral swelling, and also being associated with their own negative side-effect profile. This thesis characterises the role of neurogenic inflammation and the neuropeptide, substance P (SP), in mediating the development of blood brain barrier breakdown, cerebral oedema and resultant functional deficits following stroke, using a rodent model of reversible cerebral ischaemia. The findings of this thesis demonstrate that increased SP immunoreactivity, particularly of the penumbral tissue vasculature, is a feature of tissue perfusion following stroke, but not in non-reperfused infarcts. The central role for SP in the breakdown of the BBB following stroke and the associated deleterious effects of such breakdown was confirmed by studies using an NK&#8321; receptor antagonist. These antagonists conferred a profound attenuation of BBB breakdown, cerebral oedema formation, neuronal death and injury, and the associated development of functional deficits following reversible stroke. Similarly, depletion of all neuropeptides by capsaicin pre-treatment also reduced both histological abnormalities and functional deficits following stroke, confirming the central role of neuropeptides in the secondary injury process after stroke. The NK&#8321; receptor antagonist was able to be safely combined with the currently approved treatment for stroke, tPA, producing a synergistic effect of greater protection from the ischaemic insult. In particular, histological and functional outcome were markedly improved, as well as a reduction in the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage and death. Furthermore, the NK&#8321; receptor antagonist was effective even when administered up to 8 h following the onset of ischaemia, and in a variety of stroke severities. We conclude that SP plays a central role in the secondary injury that occurs following stroke, in particular, the genesis of BBB breakdown and cerebral oedema. Accordingly, combination therapy of tPA and an NK&#8321; receptor antagonist may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of ischaemic stroke of varying severity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuropeptides; stroke; functional outcome; oedema</field><field name="subject">Substance P</field><field name="subject">Cerebral ischemia Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frontier mythology in the American teen film.</field><field name="creator">Harper, Rowena</field><field name="description">This thesis examines representations of youth in the American &#8220;teen film&#8221;. As a critical category, the teen film is still developing, but it has been defined by a number of critics as being&#8212;ostensibly&#8212;about and for youth.&#185; This thesis engages with teen film literature to test the meaning of these terms. As a genre that is precariously positioned between parent culture and youth audiences, teen film&#8217;s narratives are always negotiated and the degree to which it is about and for youth is debatable. I argue that rather than being about and for youth in simple terms, the teen film deploys narratives about a certain idea of youth that is distinctly American and historically contingent; in other words, while certainly consumed by youth and depicting narratives that feature youthful characters and themes, the teen film genre contributes to discourses that are about and for the idea of America. My argument contributes to the critical literature on teen film by exploring the ways the teen film functions as a representation of American ideology. It outlines how, in America, the category of &#8220;youth&#8221; has historically functioned as an important site of ideological inscription in which to construct an idealised future. In the early 20th century (via the discourse of adolescence), youth was specifically idealised as a frontier space, a site in which to symbolically reconcile troubling anxieties and contradictions left unresolved at the closure of the American frontier. Up to the end of World War II, Hollywood cinema functioned similarly, as a site in which the troubling contradiction between the national ideals of individualism and community might be mobilised and contained, via the &#8220;reconciliatory&#8221; narrative.&#178; The teen film emerged in the period immediately after World War II, when Hollywood&#8217;s efforts to resolve the tensions inherent in frontier mythology were foundering. The teen film might have represented a convergence of the potential reconciliatory powers of cinema and youth, but rather than assisting in the resolution of American ideological crises, the teen film problematised them. Screening youth as an inherently rebellious space, a &#8220;frontier&#8221; space, facilitated the breakdown of the reconciliatory pattern. In the teen films of the 1950s, the conflict between the ideals of individualism and community proved irreconcilable. Subsequent teen film cycles stage and re-stage the conflict between individual and community, offering repeated takes on what those fundamentally &#8220;American&#8221; ideals mean in each generation. This thesis traces developments in the representation of the conflict between individual and community through four of the teen film&#8217;s dominant cycles&#8212;delinquency films from the 1950s, slasher films and animal comedies from the 1970s-to-mid-1980s, and makeover films from the late-1990s-to-early-2000s. Proceeding from the initial deliberation over the terms about and for youth, I include discussions of films like Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Porky&#8217;s (1982) while excluding films like River&#8217;s Edge (1986) and Kids (1995), which certainly represent youth, but are typically not viewed by them.  &#185; This definition is supported by the work of Catherine Driscoll and Stephen Tropiano. &#178; This thesis works from Robert B.

There are different methods of assessment during pregnancy and in labour. Doppler ultrasound is one of the tests widely used in clinical practice in the evaluation of pregnancies that are at a greater risk of developing maternal or fetal complications due to uteroplacental insufficiency. Doppler ultrasound enables evaluation of sequential changes in circulatory haemodynamics in the fetus by evaluation of the fetus for signs of brain sparing and severity of redistribution of circulation. Recognition of abnormal Doppler flow patterns helps the clinician to optimise the appropriate timing of delivery. Identification of the &#8216;high risk&#8217; fetus, before any changes of fetal compromise become evident, still remains one of the major dilemmas in contemporary clinical practice. This thesis seeks to explore the role of Doppler monitoring fetal intrauterine central shunts as a method of identifying the &#8216;high-risk&#8217; fetus before any other established parameters, such as, fetal biometry, fetal weight or flow waveforms in umbilical artery become abnormal. This thesis also evaluates the role of serial Doppler monitoring of fetal central shunts in those fetuses where IUGR has been established. This is based on the premise that the intrauterine shunts are present in fetal circulation to work closely with the placenta to ensure appropriate nutrition and oxygenation of the fetus, bypassing the lungs. Four prospective longitudinal studies were designed to evaluate the role of fetal intrauterine shunts in adaptive response mechanisms in cardiovascular stress. Two models were taken into consideration: an &#8216;acute cardiovascular stress&#8217; model and a &#8216;chronic cardiovascular stress&#8217; model. To study the &#8216;response to acute cardiovascular stress&#8217; in high-risk fetuses, a cohort of mothers undergoing fetal intrauterine transfusion for fetal anaemia were selected. These fetuses were scanned immediately before and after transfusion, and Doppler flows through all the intrauterine shunts were documented and compared with fetoplacental and cerebral circulation. To study the &#8216;response to chronic cardiovascular stress&#8217;, a prospective longitudinal observational study was designed and the sequence of changes in Doppler ultrasound of the fetal central shunts studied and compared with the Doppler flow waveforms of normal pregnancies with a group of pregnancies complicated by uteroplacental insufficiency. Normograms were designed for all the Doppler parameters and flows from adverse pregnancy outcomes were compared to the normogram. The pregnancy outcomes in the longitudinal study were correlated with placental pathology. Our study showed that although changes were demonstrated in the flow patterns within central shunts, these changes were not statistically significant in the &#8216;acute cardiovascular stress model&#8217;, suggesting that there may be other haemodynamic alterations in acute cardiovascular stress. However, in the &#8216;chronic cardiovascular stress model&#8217;, the results suggest that the intrauterine cardiac shunts may play an important role in redistribution of fetal flows in early stages of growth restriction, suggesting that Doppler ultrasound monitoring of foramen ovale can be potentially used as a screening tool to identify high-risk fetuses as early as 16 weeks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetus; IUGR; Cardiac; Ultrasound; Doppler; Planental insufficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern &#8211;how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction and transmission of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Maori folklore</field><field name="subject">Maori stories</field><field name="subject">cognitive models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapumau te mauri : values-based Maori organisations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Knox, Colin</field><field name="description">The political and economic history of New Zealand since the turn of the nineteenth century has been characterised by the colonisation of the indigenous Maori people by settlers mainly from Britain. In 1840 the British Crown and representative Maori Rangatira signed the Maori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi, which guaranteed to Maori continuing ownership of their land and natural resources, and self determination under the protection of the Crown, What Maori did not know in signing the Treaty was that already thousands of new settlers were being recruited in Britain on the promise of a paradise, where vacant land could be purchased cheaply and every man was the equal of his master. While the Maori population was in decline following the introduction of disease and the musket, the immigrant European population exploded. It established a Westminster styled Government which in its early years included no Maori, and passed laws which over the next 50 years alienated Maori from 95% of their land, prevented Maori from accumulating capital and participating in the most rewarding industries, and imposed alien social institutions on a previously well organised and successful people. For many Maori in the twenty-first century, the legacy of colonisation has been either marginalisation in rural communities on land frozen by legal structures which run counter to traditional values and procedures, or migration to towns and cities where employment opportunities are mainly in less skilled work and subject to variation in the economy. This thesis examines the extent of the displacement of the institutions of Maori society and its impact on the development of Maori land and other assets. It proposes an approach which could assist shareholders in Maori land to reassert traditional values and tikanga and promote collective decision making, while gaining understanding of the concepts and language of business and organisations and a skill base for greater participation in the organisations which own and manage their assets. The research results are promising, with participants in a research project accepting an approach to governance and organisation which bridges tikanga and modem business structures. There is evidence from an extended case study that the approach engenders a confidence which has positive social and cultural outcomes while encouraging the development of Maori land</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">community organisation</field><field name="subject">Maori land</field><field name="subject">Maori development</field><field name="subject">Maori organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing typozilla : an online application that appeals to gifted children : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Blachnitzky, Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis responds to the specific educational and social needs of gifted children within the context of online applications. Online enrichment activities and social opportunities are only successful if they are able to attract and sustain attention of the advanced interests of gifted children. The aim of the research is to design an online application that appeals to gifted children and recognises the identified intellectual and social needs within the New Zealand context. This was achieved through research through design by establishing a design strategy that uses the findings of investigations and applies them to a prototype application. Developers of online content for gifted children may benefit from this research. As an initial investigation a survey was conducted about how gifted New Zealand primary school children are using online applications. It was assumed following the literature review that online applications would appeal to gifted children if they teach a new skill, have multiplayer functionality and address higher order thinking skills. Basic design characteristics of the most popular gaming websites amongst gifted children (from the survey) were then used to inform the design strategy and to develop the prototype online application typozilla. Key findings were retrieved through observation of gifted children using typozilla. The majority of children observed were especially enthusiastic seeing other players&#8217; avatars within multiplayer areas and competing against each other. They enjoyed learning a new skill (which was touch-typing) and engaging in creative tasks. In interviews all gifted children confirmed that they perceived the typozilla design as appealing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational games design</field><field name="subject">typewriting</field><field name="subject">gifted children education</field><field name="subject">typing</field><field name="subject">typozilla</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of ethylene and auxin in responses of roots to phosphate supply in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) : a thesis presentation in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dinh, Phuong Thi Yen</field><field name="description">Phosphate (P) supply is one of the major determining factors to plant productivity, since the element affects the growth and the development of plants. In response to Pdeficiency treatment, plants display alterations in root system architecture caused by changes in primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) length and LR density. In this thesis, the root growth of the agronomically important legume, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was found to be slightly stimulated in terms of PR length, LR number and total LR length when plants were grown in a P-deficient media (0.01 mM orthophosphate; Pi) when compared with plants grown in a P-sufficient media (1.00 mM Pi) when using a hydroponic growth system. When plants are grown in a P-sufficient media, treatment with 100 nM exogenous 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and exogenous auxin (5 nM 1- naphthylacetic acid, NAA) resulted in significant increases in white clover PR length, LR number and LR length. However, when ethylene action or auxin transport were inhibited using 300 ppm 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and 100 nM 1-Nnaphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), respectively, root growth was significantly reduced which suggests roles for ethylene and auxin in mediating white clover root growth. To examine the effects of these hormones on plants grown in P-deficient media, 100 nM ACC treatment significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of growth on Pdeficient media only, while exposure of plants to P-deficiency alone was sufficient to significantly neutralise the inhibitory effects of 1-MCP on root growth. Hence, exposure to P-deficiency is proposed to increase either ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene sensitivity in white clover roots. In contrast, for plants grown in P-deficient media, treatment with 5 nM NAA significantly abolished the stimulation of white clover root growth observed with P-deficiency so it is proposed that exposure to Pdeficiency increases either auxin biosynthesis or auxin sensitivity, but the 5nM NAA concentration used was too high to stimulate root growth. Using DR5p::GUS transgenic white clover, auxin activity was found in the root tips and root primordia. Using these plants, it is suggested that P-deficient treatment and ACC treatment influenced white clover root growth through an increase in auxin sensitivity. Overall, ethylene and auxin are found to be essential in mediating white clover root growth in P-sufficiency, and also in mediating root responses to P-deficiency through changes in terms of the biosynthesis and the sensitivity of these two hormones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens L</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">auxin</field><field name="subject">phosphate</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of multiple sclerosis on committed caring relationships: the experience of twelve spousal carepartners dealing with this "uninvited guest"</field><field name="creator">Zuluaga, Beatrice Harrison</field><field name="description">This research study explores the perceived impact of multiple sclerosis on &#8220;carepartners&#8221; in committed caring relationships as the spousal roles change over time. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this study of persons with MS and their spousal carers residing in Australia during ten months of recruitment. Varied recruitment methods were used including the internet. 263 expressions of interest were received, and 203 survey packets were returned with usable data (77%). The demographic instrument and 4 scales measuring mood, reciprocity, life satisfaction and functional wellness were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. Results from the quantitative phase of the study supported many international epidemiological findings related to gender, age of onset, difficulty in obtaining a diagnosis in the light of vague early symptoms of MS, and high levels of depression in the study sample. The preliminary analysis suggested that these data should be analysed further in dyadic terms (a person with MS and their identified carer). Further inferential statistical analysis examined the data sub-set of &#8216;pairs only&#8217; which helped to inform formation of a pool of couples in caring relationships from which was selected a sub-sample of 12 spousal dyads residing in Victoria for interview in the second phase of the study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiple sclerosis, psychosocial aspects, concept of carepartnership, reciprocity and caring relationships, empathy and support of healthcare professionals as perceived by carepartners in MS, development of new facilitating role for people with MS, PwMS, review of healthcare model</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A heuristic framework for the determination of the critical elements in authentic assessment</field><field name="creator">Ashford-Rowe, Kevin Hugh</field><field name="description">Higher Education is currently undergoing a period of significant challenge and transformation. It is likely that these challenges will, in a comparatively short period of time, lead to changes in the ways in which the higher education experience is both mediated and accessed. These changes have arisen as a result of a number of factors, including the information revolution, and the consequent pace of technological innovation, the increased demand from both employers and government for a more highly skilled workforce and the desire to increase and make more accessible the higher education experience to an increasing proportion of the overall population. All of this has impacted upon the ways in which the higher education experience is represented, and in turn, by which students gain access to the knowledge and skills that will underpin their ability to both learn and perform. Higher education is increasingly being challenged to demonstrate its continued value to the broader community, especially employers, by ensuring that it provides capable, competent and informed citizens adequate to the challenges of a twenty-first century lifetime. If these principles are considered drivers for change, then it is important that the higher education sector can continue to demonstrate its ongoing value to the students who undertake it. It is against this background that this study was developed with the purpose of identifying from the literature, and then to codify into an applicable framework, the critical elements that would determine an assessment as being authentic. The study took as its starting point the importance, in the current educational context, of being able to determine the elements that define an educational experience as being an authentic one. The research commenced with a review of the literature to identify and collate those elements that had been identified by previous researchers in the field. Next these elements, once refined iteratively in practice, were developed into a framework that could be applied by the designer of instruction and assessment, in order to ascertain whether such a framework could be used to support the design of a more authentic assessment experience. This framework was then applied in practice and the student&#8217;s response to the learning and assessment designed according to these elements was evaluated, and the elements were further reviewed and revised upon the basis of this data. Thus the study was conducted in four phases, in the first of which the researcher explored the problem, in the second the researcher sought the development of a solution, and in the third phase this solution was implemented and evaluated, the findings were presented in the final phase. The findings of this study suggest that not only is it possible to codify those elements critical to the determination of authenticity into such a framework, but moreover, it is possible to systematically apply them in the design of assessment activity. Thus the implication of this research for educators and educational designers who seek to meet a requirement for workplace relevance in the design of their education and assessment activities is that they will have a better opportunity to both identify and then apply specific design principles that will assist them in the better development of assessment outcomes with a clearer workplace applicability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of secondary schools in the development of student knowledge about poverty in Australia, The Philippines and Zimbabwe</field><field name="creator">Burgis, Paul Lindsay, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined student knowledge about the nature, scope, causes and responses to poverty, student perceptions of the emphasis in the school curricula on poverty and development, student attitudes to poverty and the factors that influence such knowledge and attitudes. Knowledge and attitudes at the end of primary school were compared with those after four years of secondary school in three nations, Australia. The Philippines and Zimbabwe, involving 1296 surveys and 188 interviews. The investigation draws on earlier work in Ireland (Regan, 1996). and is a response to the recent emphasis on the role of schools in development education in Europe (Lemmers, 2001) and the call for a greater emphasis in Australia on this area (Simons. Hart and WTalsh, 1997). The survey compared student understanding with current 'knowledge' in the literature and the interview allowed an examination of the stories students constructed about people in poverty, including their cognitive and affective responses to people in poverty. Results showed that whilst almost all students recognised that poverty exists, they were more likely to define it simply as a lack of income than as a phenomenon involving social power and self esteem. Few students were aware that the majority of the world's poor are female. Nationality was an important predictor of student knowledge and values. Australian students considered nationally based causes (e.g., government, education) to be more important than personal qualities (e.g., laziness) or international causes (e.g., powerful countries). Australian students were also more likely to value hedonism, but it could not be demonstrated conclusively that this affected the ways that they defined poverty and its causes. Filipino students were more likely to perceive poverty as being the fault of the person experiencing poverty and were more pejorative towards the poor.  Whilst Filipino and Zimbabwean students considered that they had learnt a lot about poverty, few Australian students thought this to be the case. Students in senior secondary school were not well informed of current understandings about poverty and development and did not possess a significantly greater knowledge than primary school students on these matters. Specifically. current school practices allow students to perceive poverty as primarily income related and do not place due emphasis on internationally related causes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty - Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">High schools - Australia</field><field name="subject">High schools - Zimbabwe</field><field name="subject">High schools - Philippines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and characterization of multipath fading channels in cellular mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Khan, Noor Muhammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the enormous capacity and performance gains associated with the use of antenna arrays in wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication links, it is inevitable that these technologies will become an integral part of future systems. In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Arab as spectacle: race, gender and representation in Australian popular culture</field><field name="creator">Abood, Paula, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis, The Arab as Spectacle, is about representation. It is about the limits and the contradictions of representation. It is about the burden and the violence of representation. It is about the persistence of Orientalism and how the hierarchies of race and gender intersect with discourses on sexuality to inform and inflect the representation of Arabs in contemporary literary and media spheres of Australian popular culture. This thesis comprises two sections. Part One is a research dissertation that explores the strategies, devices and parameters of the representation of Arabic culture and identities through close readings of specific texts. This theoretical project inaugurates the second part of my study which takes up the question of the contradictions of representation through a collection of ficto-critical writings. Through these satirical narratives, I seek to expose and disrupt the hegemony of Orientalist representations that proliferate in English language literature and news media by bringing into focus the inherent paradox of representation, working within and against Orientalist representational traditions. In so doing, it is not my aim to 'correct' the Orientalist logic and imagery that I theorise in the first part of this thesis, but rather to undermine the spurious truth-value of Orientalist representations by deploying the literary weapons of satire, parody and irony. In this way, my fiction works to engage creatively and critically with the very tropes that I theorise in my research dissertation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orientalism.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Arabs in popular culture -- Western countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developmental trajectories into substance use in adolescence</field><field name="creator">McAloon, Thomas John, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal developmental characteristics of the association between mental health and substance use. N=1182 adolescents aged between 11 and 20 years were recruited from schools in Australia. Participants completed the Youth Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach, 1991a) and reported on their use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, their social ability, their motivation for using substances, their ability to regulate emotion, and the influences of their parents and peers on their substance use. N=561 of time one participants were retained for testing one year later to assess the potential to predict substance use at time two from mental health at time one. Results indicated a clear and consistent cross-sectional association between externalising scores on the YSR and use of the three substances, regardless of gender. The relation between internalising scores and substance use was non-significant. When the relation between externalising scores and substance use was assessed for mediation, only the influence of parents and peers was found to be significant. A cross-sectional structural model developed to account for this association was demonstrated to be invariant across the three substances of interest, and across gender, but not age category. There was no evidence that social skills, emotion regulation, or substance use motives, had roles in mediating the relationship between mental health and substance use. A model was developed to assess the potential to predict substance use at time two from externalising scores at time one. Results showed that externalising scores predicted increases in alcohol use via parent and peer attitudes. Thus, externalising disposition, in the context of a facilitative social environment, was predictive of an increase in alcohol use over time. Structural models developed to account for the predictive relation between externalising scores and use of cigarettes and marijuana  proved unstable and could not be tested. Substance use at time one was not predictive of externalising scores at time two. The results of the present research are discussed in relation to their potential to inform the developmental substance use literature, and efforts directed against the development of substance use problems.

The                 (re)productions and transmissions of Polish identity formations, and the acts of remembrance, are multifarious by nature, and I have examined them in two distinctly different settings ?? in public spheres in Poland, and in the private realms of Australian Polish diaspora.  In this thesis, these research settings have been conceptualised as the conduits through which Polish identities are maintained.  Polish identity is theorised using a constructivist approach; Polish identities are therefore positioned historically and geographically.  Their performances are fluid: they move through time and across spaces.  The active maintenance of Polish identity developed as a result of foreign occupations.  The partitioning of Poland by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires lasted 123 years.  From 1795 to 1918 the Polish nation was expunged.  Following a brief period of independence between World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII), Poland was again occupied by Nazi and Soviet regimes during WWII (1939-1945).  The Soviet occupation continued after WWII with the Soviet-supported Polish government that lasted until 1989.  Under occupation ?? particularly during WWII ?? Poland suffered events that have been indelibly imprinted within Polish cultural memory.  The macabre nature of this era included the incursion of hegemonic regimes on political and everyday social life, as well as the atrocities for which it is well known.  An important outcome of these occupations has been the division of discourses of Polishness, and their remembrances, into distinctly public and private spheres.  These periods of foreign occupation brought various attempts to suppress and eliminate Polishness: the cultures and identifications of Polish people.  Suppression particularly occurred in public spheres through the prohibition of the Polish language, and by investing the public memory landscape with ideologies that represented the new regimes.  By repressing public commemorations of Polish cultural narratives, a new history was written at the expense of the Polish experience.  There have been two primary responses to these repressions of Polishness.  These responses initially developed during the partitioned period to ensure that Polish language and cultural practices were maintained.  First, a narrative and tradition of resistance emerged in reaction to the Russian, Prussian and Austrian partitions.  It was enacted through military participation in insurrections and through the production of patriotic Romantic Era cultural artefacts, both of which strengthened linkages to the Polish Catholic faith.  Second, Polish cultural practices and language were safeguarded in the private spheres of home.  It was in private settings, in Poland and within the diaspora in Australia, that memories and experiences of occupation were passed on and through generations.  In Poland, such narratives were often maintained in resistance to those imposed by foreign occupiers and because of the inability to commemorate events of Poland??s macabre past in public.  In Australia, identity maintenance has occurred to resist the dissolution of Polishness in a diasporic and multicultural environment.  This thesis demonstrates the utility of studying cultural memories as a means of understanding how identity maintenance can occur in the face of adversities, such as the multiple foreign occupations that occurred in Poland, and in diaspora.  Moreover, it exemplifies the diverse paths of identity maintenance in different contexts.  This thesis shows that despite the distinctive character of both Polish public and private spheres, Polish identities have been informed, shaped and maintained through culturally-enacted memory (re)production.  This process is exhibited in the present ?? in Poland and through the diaspora ?? and it occurred despite the repressive aims of various foreign occupiers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polishness</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Polish -- Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting the ageing aircraft challenge</field><field name="creator">Crowley, Christopher Keith, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">&amp;quotMeeting the ageing aircraft challenge&amp;quot is not just about safety, not just about effectiveness, and not just about economy of support. It is about proactive and reactive optimization of all three service goals throughout long life cycles that span 20 or 30 years, or more, and typically, beyond the originally intended design life.  It is therefore about organizational attitudes towards ongoing trend analysis and condition monitoring, and pervading cost benefit assessments of all forms of human innovation across what the author describes as 'the eight sustaining disciplines for long aerospace life cycles', including scientific and technological developments, and opportunities for reliability growth or 'refresh'. Complacency is the root cause of all problems with the design, maintenance and support of all modern infrastructure, and therefore life cycle planners and minders are required to be an enthusiastic but nervous lot - always hoping for the best, but planning for the worst impact of 'Mr Murphy'. Murphy thrives on complacency, is in bed with uncertainty, and never forgets (as we do often) that imperfection (no matter how small) breeds unreliability traps that patiently wait to surprise at some stage along the life cycle journey. He has the upper hand.  ...Our best weapons against Murphy are continual, total picture and longer-term situational awareness; caution, vigilance, innovation and collaboration.  This research study and thesis is intended as a broad and comprehensive management philosophy, a guide and checklist - a broad scrape of everything 'so deep', rather than coverage of any one-niche aspect of the ageing aircraft challenge in great depth. It includes a brief and simple strategic setting for Australian Military Aerospace requirements, and spans a three axes management philosophy: 1. a toolbox of eight sustaining disciplines, 2. trend analysis and 3. time-cost-benefit assessment.  Along with complacency, the prime ageing aircraft 'killers' are identified, as are the key ageing aircraft 'age multipliers'. The eight sustaining disciplines are explained in varying depth, according to their broad significance to the ageing aircraft condition and life cycle. The ever-ubiquitous bathtub reliability curve - the key to understanding, predicting and controlling life cycle behaviour (including costs) - is emphasized.  Engineering life cycle minding and capability management are broad focus areas. The eight areas of attention identified for this broad study are:  1.	  Aerospace design requirements and trends, 2.	  Science and technology opportunities, 3.	  Airworthiness, engineering and maintenance philosophy, 4.	  Reliability behaviour, 5.	  Operational use and abuse patterns, 6.	  Logistics support and managing obsolescence, 7.	  Technical workforce and organizational attitudes (requirements and outlook), and 8.	  Life cycle costing and budgeting. This thesis primarily draws attention to the fundamental driver of life cycle behaviour - reliability. The critical dependency that life cycle control and prediction has on consistent and high quality trend data collection and analysis is emphasized throughout, and the now pressing need for better identification of ageing aircraft cost growth drivers, and their containment, is linked to reliability trend awareness, manipulation and intervention. The human dimension is included - including coverage of organizational attitudes and what it takes to be a 'high reliability organization'.  There are no magic or easy answers to the ageing aircraft condition and challenge. Trend analysis has to be done from the bottom up, system by system, for each fleet type. But over time, with consistent trend data collection, patterns emerge within the sophisticated and stochastic systems behaviour that that ageing aircraft play out. These patterns enable ongoing management of the long life cycle to be more confidently predicted, more assured and with best possible cost growth containment. The best, perhaps only, path to least surprises and best cost containment is now being re-identified in some military aviation organizations as a mature and evolving RAM engineering and RCM framework.

Governments have tended to respond through legislation to restrict and redirect private decisions about resource management. However, the legislative response faces a lack of information about the costs and benefits of alternative management and policy instruments. A pertinent example of this debate is the management of wetlands on private lands.  The goal in this thesis is to advance the design of policy relating to the production of environmental outputs on private lands. This goal is achieved by first estimating the welfare impacts of alternative private land management strategies on the wider community. These estimates are used as inputs into the development of alternative policy instruments that are then evaluated in terms of their potential cost-effectiveness in influencing private management. Two case studies of wetland management on private land in Australia are presented ??? the Upper South East Region of South Australia, and, the Murrumbidgee River Floodplain in New South Wales.  The conceptual approach described in the first part of the thesis includes a description of the resource management problem and the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative decision frameworks widely employed in Australia. Identification of the cause and nature of transaction costs in the management process is the focus in this discussion.  The welfare impacts of alternative wetland management strategies are investigated through the construction of a bio-economic model for each of the case study areas. The approach integrates biophysical analysis of changing wetland management with the value society places on wetlands. Outputs from this process are used in the development of a range of policy instruments directed towards influencing wetland management. The impact of poorly quantified and uncertain transaction costs on the potential cost-effectiveness of these options is evaluated using threshold policy analysis.  The empirical results show that the perception of a conflict between the private and public values generated by resource management is accurate. For example, scenarios changing wetland management in the Upper South East of South Australia on the Murrumbidgee River floodplain in New South Wales were shown to generate net benefits of $5.2m and $5.1m respectively. Hence, changing wetland management could generate increased community welfare. The potential for these findings to be translated into wetland policy is less conclusive. Policies directed towards wetland management (in part or in whole) incur a range of transaction costs and deliver differential wetland protection benefits. Ten ???best bet??? policies are identified, but more information is required to determine conclusively whether a net benefit results to the wider community when transaction costs are included.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transaction costs</field><field name="subject">benefit-cost analysis</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">public goods</field><field name="subject">environmental economics</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="subject">bio-economic modelling</field><field name="subject">policy selection</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diverse organisation : operational considerations for managing organisational information resources</field><field name="creator">Dowse, Andrew, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sharing and exploitation of information resources across a diverse organisation can confer a significant competitive advantage but also can be a substantial challenge in coordinating across structural and specialisation boundaries. This challenge reflects the difficulties traditionally associated with lateral relations, which were recognised by classical organisational theorists but are more pronounced with the emergence of information as a critical resource. Notwithstanding the benefits of information sharing across the organisation, the classical concept of specialisation remains fundamental to organisational theory; thus there is potential for friction between requirements for specialisation and coordination. This research therefore examines information management arrangements to balance specialisation and coordination in a diverse organisation.  The research takes advantage of organisational and systems theory literature to appreciate complex information management requirements in terms of differentiation/cohesion and integration/coupling of organisational elements. Information management???s business and technology perspectives define the conceptual framework, within which gaps in the literature are identified and become the focus of the research. The two key research areas are the opportunities enabled by technology for business integration through collaborative decision-making and the management of organisation-wide information technology infrastructure. Collaborative decision-making is an integrating mechanism that can provide balance between specialisation and coordination contingent upon the nature of decision tasks and their organisational context. Propositions associated with an adaptive approach to collaborative decision-making were tested in laboratory experiments, with positive support for the contingency model albeit constrained by individual cognitive variances.  Organisations increasingly are adopting centralised approaches to the provision of IT services, with IT governance as an integrating mechanism and a need for multiple business-IT alignments to add value according to the differentiation required by organisational elements. Propositions relating to the adaptation of IT management arrangements based upon organisational characteristics were tested using a multi- iv -discipline approach, which resulted in support for the model although practical difficulties were experienced in the action research component.  This research provides a framework for maintaining effective variety of information capabilities commensurate with the diverse organisation???s mission and environment, while also exploiting the synergies and economies of shared information resources for holistic benefits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">information technology management</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">collaborative decision making</field><field name="subject">ommunication</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene profiling in soft tissue sarcoma: predictive value of EGFR in sarcoma tumour progression and survival</field><field name="creator">Das Gupta, Paromita, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite improvements in the clinical management of soft tissue sarcomas (STS), 50% of patients will die of metastatic disease that is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The aims of this study were to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in progressive and metastatic STS. In addition to this, cell lines from fresh tumours were initiated and established, thus increasing the repository of cell lines available for functional studies. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of STS have thus far not resulted in the use of molecular markers for clinical prognostication. Identifying novel genes and pathways will lead to molecular diagnostic methods to better stratify prognostic groups and could identify cellular targets for more efficacious treatments. Gene expression profiling of sarcoma cell lines of increasing metastatic potential revealed over-expression of genes involved in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) pathways. Factors involved in invasion and metastasis such as integrins and MMPs were over-expressed in the cell lines with higher metastatic potential. The developmental Notch pathway and cell cycle regulators were also dysregulated. NDRG1 was significantly over-expressed in the high grade sarcoma cell line, a novel finding in sarcomas. The expression of EGFR, NDRG1 and other genes from the above pathways was validated using quantitative RT-PCR in real time (qRT-PCR). A tissue microarray (TMA) comprising STS of varying tumour grades was constructed for high throughput assessment of target proteins. EGFR, its activated form and its signal transducers were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Activated EGFR (HR 2.228, p &lt; 0.001) and phosphorylated Akt (HR 2.032, p = 0.003) were found to be independent predictors of overall survival and both correlated with tumour grade. Of the several STS cultures initiated and maintained, two of these cell lines were fully characterised in terms of cytogenetics, telomerase and alternate lengthening of 5 telomeres (ALT) status, KIT and TP53 mutation and the expression of certain biomarkers using both qRT-PCR and IHC. In summary, transcript profiling identified several potential biomarkers of tumour progression and metastasis in STS. Crucially, activated EGFR and pAkt were found in a cohort of STS samples to correlate with clinical outcome, identifying them as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in the treatment of STS. Activated EGFR can be used as a diagnostic marker for patient selection, as well as for target effect monitoring. Furthermore, the cell lines established in this project will serve as valuable tools in future preclinical studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activated EGFR</field><field name="subject">soft tissue sarcoma</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">gene expression profiling</field><field name="subject">tissue microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting and preventing the spread of lantana into the Blue Mountains</field><field name="creator">Gold, Daniel Alexander, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Invasive weeds inflict significant harm on native species, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbance regimes.  When managing these weed threats, some of the most useful tools are the outputs of predictive distribution models.  As they supplement existing distribution data to assess where in the landscape is most susceptible to weed invasion, they allow for more efficient weed management because the areas most suited to weed species may be targeted for control.	This research develops a habitat suitability model for the weed lantana (Lantana camara L. sensu lato) in a portion of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area at present and under forecast warmer climates.  A generalised additive model (GAM) is used, which fits the regression curve used for prediction to the calibration data themselves and allows for an exploration of which environmental conditions favour lantana as well as where in the landscape is most suitable for the weed.  Temperature was positively correlated with suitable habitat and explained over 90% of the variation in lantana presence predicted by the model.  15% of the study area was found to be suitable for lantana at present, with this figure reaching 58% after a simulated 3??C rise in temperature.  Mapping habitat suitability across the study area allowed for the identification of five distinct pathways for lantana to further invade the Blue Mountains.	Responding to calls for the integration of weed management with biodiversity conservation, the research also integrates the habitat suitability model with information regarding the distribution of vegetation communities and endangered species in the Blue Mountains.  Thirteen native vegetation communities were found to have more than 20% suitable habitat for lantana at present, and an additional three contained more than 80% suitable habitat after a simulated 3??C rise in temperature.  Five of these communities are listed as threatened under relevant legislation and harbour at least 27 endangered species, placing additional urgency on their conservation.  	This research has successfully used modelling techniques to identify areas for targeted weed management integrated with biodiversity conservation.  The methods are easily adaptable to other weeds and regions and could thus be used to illustrate the comprehensive threat weeds pose to Australia???s biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="subject">Species distribution modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iconic lands: wilderness as a reservation criterion for world heritage</field><field name="creator">Rimini, Mario Gabriele Roberto, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wilderness is crucial for global conservation. Contemporary research established that between 33% and 52% of the Earth qualifies as wilderness. It is a fragile, threatened resource which needs a global conservation framework. This role could be successfully fulfilled by the World Heritage Convention. The founding notion of the World Heritage idea ?? Outstanding Universal Value ?? bears a striking resemblance to the attributes and characteristics of wilderness. The two notions possess an indisputable cultural and historic affinity, embodied by their ??iconic?? dimension. This makes the synergy between wilderness and World Heritage extraordinarily effective, as the history of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area demonstrates. The Franklin Dam dispute, solved after the World Heritage nomination of the Tasmanian wilderness, is emblematic in this respect. It gave birth to the world&#8223;s only protected area which includes close to 100% of the local wilderness resource, and which coincides entirely with World Heritage status. The classic wilderness character of the region matched and enhanced the iconic power of the World Heritage, and the outcome represented a watershed for Australia&#8223;s wilderness politics. Locally, it also paved the way for the establishment of a thriving ecotourism industry, providing the core of Tasmania&#8223;s ??green?? brand. Its lesson is still invoked in unresolved wilderness conflicts throughout the country, and could be applied to other similar international contexts, as a model of proactive wilderness reservation through World Heritage nomination and of economic development based on wilderness tourism. On the other hand, despite the cultural affinity wilderness was never chosen as a criterion for World Heritage identification, and therefore the Convention cannot coherently fulfill this role of wilderness protection framework before solving this paradox. The unresolved dispute over Tasmania&#8223;s wilderness forests indicates that the lack of an official endorsement of wilderness as a World Heritage criterion deprives the Convention of the conceptual tools needed to successfully address those environmental conflicts affecting existing World Heritage areas, in which the resource at stake is namely wilderness. Including wilderness as a World Heritage criterion would fill this gap and provide the global community with an effective framework for the preservation of remaining wilderness regions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation</field><field name="subject">World Heritage</field><field name="subject">Wilderness</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and application of hop count in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Chen, Quanjun, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hop count, i.e., the number of wireless hops a packet has to go through to reach the destination, is a fundamental metric in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks. Network performance, such as throughput, end-to-end delay, energy consumption, and so on, depends critically on hop count. Previous work on modeling hop count is limited in making unrealistic simplifying assumptions either at the physical or network, or both layers of the communication protocol stack. A key contribution of this thesis is to present an analytical model to derive the probability distribution of hop count under realistic assumptions at both physical and network layers. Specifically, the model considers a log-normal shadowing radio propagation capable of accommodating the random signal fading observed in most wireless communication environments, and the widely used geographic routing at the network layer. Validation of the model is achieved by a comprehensive set of simulation experiments including a trace driven simulation of a real-word vehicular ad-hoc network. The model reveals that the presence of randomness in radio propagation reduces the required number of hops to reach a given destination significantly. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed hop count model, the thesis proposes three new applications which address some of the key challenges in multi-hop wireless networks. The first application derives the per-node packet forwarding load in multi-hop wireless sensor networks and reveals that the nodes in the vicinity of the base station has a significantly less forwarding load than previously thought under simplifying radio propagation and routing assumptions. The second application demonstrates that using hop count as a measure of distance traveled by a data packet, geocasting can be achieved in multi-hop wireless networks in situations when some of the network nodes do not have access to reliable location information. Finally, the proposed hop count model is used to evaluate the performance of the third application which demonstrates that the overhead of geographic routing can be reduced significantly by embracing a position update philosophy which adapts to the mobility and communication patterns of the underlying ad-hoc network.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographic routing protocols</field><field name="subject">Wireless ad-hoc network</field><field name="subject">Performance analysis</field><field name="subject">Hop count</field><field name="subject">Routing protocol design</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor network</field><field name="subject">Geocasting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalyst for high temperature water gas shift reaction</field><field name="creator">Lei, Yun, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is focused on the study of high temperature water gas shift catalysis, the identification of new improved catalysts and the study of the kinetics and mechanism of reaction over these catalysts. Rh-promoted Fe2O3-Cr2O3 was found to offer best performance which was significantly better than unpromoted catalyst over wide temperatures range. An extensive literature survey is first reported. Guidelines to develop new WGS catalysts are developed. As a result, the activities of precious metals supported on various oxides for high temperature WGS reaction have been tested. Rh(1wt%) doped Fe2O3/Cr2O3, exhibits the highest activity for WGS over a wide temperature range. 5wt%CuO/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/U3O8, 1wt%Pt/10%U3O8-Al2O3 and 1wt%Pt/5%V2O5-TiO2 fall into the second most active catalysts group, with an improved activity compared to commercial Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalyst. It is clear that both the support/catalyst and the promoter can affect the efficiency of the WGS, leading to the obvious inference that the reaction rate is controlled at the promoter ??? support interface. Further kinetic studies and characterisation (TPR, TPD, pulse-adsorption (reaction)) on Rh/Fe3O4/Cr2O3 have been conducted. The study, conducted under conditions without inhibition from products of both forward and backward reactions, shows that the overall reaction rate expression is described as: 2 22 ??? =0.0041exp(???4042.6 ) 0.64 0.5 ???0.024 exp(???6022.9 ) 0.46 0.73 CO CO H O CO H r PP P P T T . Kinetics studies carried out under fuel reforming gas compositions shows that reaction rate expression changed when the temperature of reaction varied. The reaction rate equations at temperatures of 573K, 623K and 673K are derived as: 573K: 2 2 2 - 2.84 10-6 0.6 0.12 - 9.08 10-7 0.09 0.52 rCO = ?? PCO PH O ??

TPR, TPD, TPO characterisation studies and reoxidation of catalysts by CO2 or H2O show that the active site for high temperature WGS reaction on Rh/Fe2O3/Cr2O3 is reduced magnetite Fe3O4 which dissociatively breaks down the H2O to form H* and OH* and adsorbs CO2. The deposited metal, Rh, acts as a promoter by facilitating the uptake of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), desorption of H2 (at high temperature) and CO2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">iron oxides</field><field name="subject">chromium</field><field name="subject">catalysts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of petroleum exploration and development in India</field><field name="creator">Venugopal, Sajith, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides the background to and an analysis of the economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas discoveries in India. It is aimed at helping the oil and gas industry assess the financial attractiveness of investment in that country. The thesis describes the geography, climate, infrastructure, and energy market with an emphasis on how these affect upstream oil and gas industry investment. A detailed description and analysis is given of the petroleum production sharing contract (&amp;quotPSC&amp;quot) terms embodied in India's New Exploration Licensing Policy (&amp;quotNELP&amp;quot), and demonstrates that, depending on negotiations, Government Take under NELP terms is likely to be in the range 50% to 60% for a stand-alone petroleum development. However, PSC terms are regressive for marginal discoveries. In particular, State royalties might hinder the development of small or marginal discoveries and render them uneconomic. As an illustration, depending on the oil price, up to 6 MMbbls of oil in otherwise economically viable small fields in a geological basin might be made uneconomic and left stranded because of the effect of royalties. The thesis also analyses the economics of developing a sample of actual Indian oil and gas fields offshore the east and west coasts of the country in shallow and deep water. Onshore field developments are not analysed because of lack of data. All of the offshore developments analysed are profitable based on past and current economic conditions and knowledge. The majority are also relatively low-risk investments. Finally, the thesis evaluates the profitability of new oil and gas exploration and development offshore the east and west coasts of India. The required minimum size of new exploration prospects are in the range 10 to 17 MMbbls for oil prospects and 138 to 1,100 Bcf for gas prospects assuming a low probability of success. Once a new discovery is made, the required minimum economically developable reserves are 4 to 12 MMbbls for oil discoveries and 63 to 1,400 Bcf for gas discoveries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petroleum industry and trade</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">petroleum.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of amines and imines organometallic catalysts</field><field name="creator">Rumble, Sarah Louise, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the catalysed syntheses of amines and imines using organoiridium and organorhodium complexes with N-donor ligands as the catalysts. These catalysed syntheses were achieved via hydroamination, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation reactions, as well as tandem hydroamination/imine reduction reactions. An in situ catalysis study found that the most active catalysts for the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1) to give 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (4) were formed from a combination of catalyst components that resulted in an electron deficient metal centre, indicating that an alkyne binding mechanism was most likely. The kinetics of the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1), catalysed by the complexes [Rh(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (7), [Ir(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (8), [Rh(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (9),and [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) (bpm = bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane and bim = bis(Nmethylimidazol- 2-yl)methane) were modelled and compared. The nature of the metal centre was found to have the most influence on the rate of the product release step, while the nature of the N-donor ligand was found to have the most influence on the rate of the substrate binding step. The investigation of the catalysed hydroamination of the phenyl substituted alkynylamines 5-phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (2), 4-phenyl-3-butyn-1-amine (13) and 2- phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (34) revealed a difference in catalytic activity between the rhodium and iridium complexes depending on the alkyne substituent. A series of novel rhodium(I) complexes were synthesised: [RhClCO(Mes-DAD(Me))] (38), [RhClCO(Mes-BIAN)] (22), [Rh(COD)(Mes-BIAN)][BF4] (39), [Rh2(COD)2(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (40) and [Rh2(CO)4(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (41), where Mes- DAD(Me) = biacetylbis(2,4,6-trimethylphenylimine), Mes-BIAN = bis(2,4,6- trimethylphenylimino)acenapthene and bmimen = 1,2-bis[(1-methyl-2- imidazolyl)methylene-amino]ethane. The cationic complex 40 was found to be an active hydroamination catalyst, while the neutral complexes 38 and 22 were only active in the presence of the tetraphenylborate counterion. A range of imines was found to be efficiently reduced to their respective amines via hydrosilylation or hydrogenation using the iridium(I) complex [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) as catalyst. The hydrosilylation reaction was found to be significantly faster in a protic solvent (methanol), giving the desilylated amines without the need for a desilylation step. The mechanism of this reaction was proposed to involve a monohydride iridium(I) complex as a key intermediate. The tandem hydroamination/hydrosilylation of a series of alkynylamine substrates was achieved using the iridium complexes 8 and 10, in which the iridium complex catalyses the two mechanistically distinct reactions in the one-pot. Catalysed tandem hydroamination/hydrogenation reactions were also achieved, but were less facile.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amines</field><field name="subject">organometallic catalysts</field><field name="subject">imines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume: Astrolabe Park, Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jorstad, Lange B., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spatial and temporal variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume is examined to determine the mechanisms responsible for the observed variation, and to provide an assessment of the implications of this variation with respect to the interpretation of monitoring data, specifically with regards to its application to geochemical modelling. An integrated approach to field investigation was utilised in this study, including sample collection from a network of standard and bundled piezometers, surface and borehole geophysical investigation techniques, and a manometer board for the measurement of hydraulic head in bundled piezometers. Nine groundwater sampling events were conducted over a 12 month period, with sample analyses comprising field measurement of water quality parameters and redox sensitive elements, and laboratory analysis for major and trace elements and stable isotopes (??18O, ??2H, ??13C-DIC, ??15N). The vertical position of the centre of mass of the leachate plume was observed to vary up to 2 metres between monitoring events, and concentrations of key indicator parameters were observed to fluctuate by as much as 160%. The electrical images created by surface resistivity transects along a groundwater flow path between the landfill and a groundwater-fed pond a short distance downgradient suggest a plume configuration characterised by discrete pulses of concentrated leachate migrating in a conservative manner between the landfill and the pond. It is hypothesized that these leachate slugs are flushed into the aquifer during sustained periods of rainfall, presumed to be a significant driver of leachate mobilisation into the underlying aquifer. The most significant hydrogeochemical processes affecting contaminant mobilisation, transport and attenuation in the leachate-impacted shallow aquifer included microbial degradation of organic waste, dissolution of inorganic waste, ion exchange, precipitation of sulfide and carbonate minerals, mixing with rainfall recharge along flow path, and redox transformations along the plume fringe. These processes are supported by hydrogeochemical data analysis, and generally agree with the results of inverse geochemical modelling. While analysis of detailed groundwater monitoring appears to provide a plausible description of the plume dynamics, the results of the electrical resistivity transects indicates a more varied and complex plume configuration than is suggested by the borehole data alone. This integration of investigation techniques underscores the inherent inadequacy of even a high-resolution monitoring well network to accurately describe the full extent of variation in time and space within a contaminant plume, even in a relatively simple aquifer environment, and accentuates the potentially significant limitations of site-scale hydrogeochemical interpretation based solely on borehole monitoring data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">plumes (Fluid dynamics).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality and the prediction of work performance: artificial neural networks versus linear regression</field><field name="creator">Minbashian, Amirali, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research that has evaluated the effectiveness of personality variables for predicting work performance has predominantly relied on methods designed to detect simple relationships. The research reported in this thesis employed artificial neural networks ??? a method that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear and configural relationships among variables ??? and the findings were compared to those obtained by the more traditional method of linear regression. Six datasets that comprise a range of occupations, personality inventories, and work performance measures were used as the basis of the analyses. A series of studies were conducted to compare the predictive performance of prediction equations that a) were developed using either artificial neural networks or linear regression, and b) differed with respect to the type and number of personality variables that were used as predictors of work performance. Studies 1 and 2 compared the two methods using individual personality variables that assess the broad constructs of the five-factor model of personality. Studies 3 and 4 used combinations of these broad variables as the predictors. Study 5 employed narrow personality variables that assess specific facets of the broad constructs. Additional methodological contributions include the use of a resampling procedure, the use of multiple measures of predictive performance, and the comparison of two procedures for developing neural networks. Across the studies, it was generally found that the neural networks were rarely able to outperform the simpler linear regression equations, and this was attributed to the lack of reliable nonlinearity and configurality in personality-work performance relationships. However, the neural networks were able to outperform linear regression in the few instances where there was some independent evidence of nonlinear or configural relationships. Consequently, although the findings do not support the  usefulness of neural networks for specifically improving the effectiveness of personality variables as predictors of work performance, in a broader sense they provide some grounds for optimism for organisational researchers interested in applying this method to investigate and exploit complex relationships among variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clearance of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease: To understand the pathogenesis and develop potential therapies in animal models</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yan-Jiang</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. No strong disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) appears to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. We focused our interest on revealing the pathogenesis of the disease and developing novel therapeutic modalities. The thesis consists of three projects: 
1. Prevention of AD by intramuscular delivery of an anti-Abeta single chain antibody (scFv) gene:
Immunotherapy is effective in removing brain Abeta&#131;zbut was associated with detrimental effects. In the present study, the gene of an anti-Abeta scFv was delivered in the hind leg muscles of APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice with adeno-associated virus at three months of age. Six months later, we found that brain Abeta accumulation, AD-type pathologies and cognitive impairment were significantly attenuated in scFv-treated mice relative to enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-treated mice. Intramuscular delivery of scFv gene was well tolerated by the animals. These findings suggest that peripheral application of scFv is effective and safe in preventing the development of AD, and would be a promising non-inflammatory immunological modality for prevention and treatment of AD.
2. Prevention of AD with grape seed derived polyphenols: Polyphenols extracted from grape seeds are able to inhibit Abeta&#131;naggregation, reduce Abeta production and protect against Abeta neurotoxicity in vitro. We investigated the therapeutic effects of a polyphenol-rich grape seed extract (GSE) in vivo. APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were fed with normal AIN-93G diet (control diet), AIN-93G diet with 0.07% curcumin, or diet with 2% GSE beginning at 3 months of age for 9 months. Total phenolic content of GSE was 592.5 mg/g dry weight, including gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin and proanthocyanidins. Long-term feeding of GSE diet was well tolerated. The Abeta&#131;nlevels in the brain and serum of the mice fed with GSE were reduced by 33% and 44% respectively compared with the mice fed with the control diet. Amyloid plaques and microgliosis in the brain of mice fed with GSE were also reduced by 49% and 70% respectively. In conclusion, polyphenol-rich GSE is promising to be a safe and effective drug to prevent the development of AD.  
3. Roles of p75NTR in the development of AD: P75NTR has been suggested to mediate Abeta induced neurotoxicity. However, its role in the development of AD is undetermined. APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were crossed with p75NTR knockout mice to generate APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice with p75NTR gene deleted. P75NTR mainly expressed in the basal forebrain neurons and degenerative neurites in neocortex and hippocampus. Genetic deletion of p75NTR gene in APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice reduced soluble Abeta levels, but increased the insoluble Abeta accumulation and Abeta plaque formation in the brain. P75NTR deletion decreased Abeta production of cortical neurons in vitro. Recombinant extracellular domain of p75NTR attenuated the oligomerization and fibrillation of synthetic Abeta42 peptide in vitro, and reduced local Abeta plaques after hippocampus injection in vivo. Our data suggest that p75NTR plays an important role in AD development and may be a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">amyloid-beta</field><field name="subject">immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">grape seed extract</field><field name="subject">polyphenol</field><field name="subject">p75NTR</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100419.124325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement learning and approximation complexity</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Matthew A. F</field><field name="description">Many tasks can easily be posed as the problem of responding to the states of an external world with actions that maximise the reward received over time. Algorithms that reliably solve such problems exist. However, their worst-case complexities are typically more than proportional to the size of the state space in which a task is to be performed. Many simple tasks involve enormous numbers of states, which can make the application of such algorithms impractical. This thesis examines reinforcement learning algorithms which effectively learn to perform tasks by constructing mappings from states to suitable actions. In problems involving large numbers of states, these algorithms usually must construct approximate, rather than exact, solutions and the primary issue examined in the thesis is the way in which the complexity of constructing adequate approximations scales as the size of a state space increases. The vast majority of reinforcement learning algorithms operate by constructing estimates of the long-term value of states and using these estimates to select actions. The potential effects of errors in such estimates are examined and shown to be severe. Empirical results are presented which suggest that minor errors are likely to result in significant losses in many problems, and where such losses are most likely to occur. The complexity of constructing estimates accurate enough to prevent significant losses is also examined empirically and shown to be substantial.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapumau te mauri : values-based Maori organisations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Knox, Colin</field><field name="description">The political and economic history of New Zealand since the turn of the nineteenth century has been characterised by the colonisation of the indigenous Maori people by settlers mainly from Britain. In 1840 the British Crown and representative Maori Rangatira signed the Maori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi, which guaranteed to Maori continuing ownership of their land and natural resources, and self determination under the protection of the Crown, What Maori did not know in signing the Treaty was that already thousands of new settlers were being recruited in Britain on the promise of a paradise, where vacant land could be purchased cheaply and every man was the equal of his master. While the Maori population was in decline following the introduction of disease and the musket, the immigrant European population exploded. It established a Westminster styled Government which in its early years included no Maori, and passed laws which over the next 50 years alienated Maori from 95% of their land, prevented Maori from accumulating capital and participating in the most rewarding industries, and imposed alien social institutions on a previously well organised and successful people. For many Maori in the twenty-first century, the legacy of colonisation has been either marginalisation in rural communities on land frozen by legal structures which run counter to traditional values and procedures, or migration to towns and cities where employment opportunities are mainly in less skilled work and subject to variation in the economy. This thesis examines the extent of the displacement of the institutions of Maori society and its impact on the development of Maori land and other assets. It proposes an approach which could assist shareholders in Maori land to reassert traditional values and tikanga and promote collective decision making, while gaining understanding of the concepts and language of business and organisations and a skill base for greater participation in the organisations which own and manage their assets. The research results are promising, with participants in a research project accepting an approach to governance and organisation which bridges tikanga and modem business structures. There is evidence from an extended case study that the approach engenders a confidence which has positive social and cultural outcomes while encouraging the development of Maori land</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">community organisation</field><field name="subject">Maori land</field><field name="subject">Maori development</field><field name="subject">Maori organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Networking for gold : a multi-level analysis to explain network organising dynamics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Marketing at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Martin, Simon Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research is to understand how the multiple levels within networks influence the organising dynamics in an intentionally formed network through the measurement of tie strength. This is a significant contribution because previous research is based on network studies in which only one level is considered, most of the research is conceptually undeveloped in the area. The research also addresses the measurement of the strength of relationships rather than just their existence or non-existence. Furthermore, this study examines intentionally created networks &#8211; an area where there is currently very little research. Thus the study is significant because the new data contributes to the marketing research environment and can be presented to examine findings in other research contexts, including the social policy and not-for-profit sectors. To address the aim and context of the study it was necessary to understand a national programme which had global objectives. The research involved a multi-method approach that utilised a single case-study strategy with multiple embedded cases consisting of three interdependent, intentionally formed networks, each with a central broker, in the elite and high-performance sport sector in New Zealand. The overall contributions of the research were: (1) The identification of a new network type, termed here as a structured network. (2) The finding that networks that are intentionally created and managed can be durable and effective, and this is dependent on the role of the central broker. This finding has obvious implications for practitioners involved in such networks and for governments that are interested in creating them. (3) The finding that cross-level pressures influence network effectiveness. (4) The finding that relationships developed at the pre-network formation stage contribute to network effectiveness. (5) And finally, the identification of a new stage of intentional network formation. This stage was taken by the New Zealand government issuing a tender in order to gauge the level of interest and the resources available to provide a network of services before establishing it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">sport sector</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming bilingual : exploring language and literacy learning through the lens of narrative.</field><field name="creator">Taniguchi, Sumiko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I investigate the nature of change that two adult language learners/users have experienced in learning to become bilingual through the mediation of autobiographical narrative writing. The major purposes of the thesis are to identify the nature of change that adult language learners/users have experienced in learning and using plural languages through the mediation of autobiographical writing in L2, and to examine the usefulness of narrative inquiry as a complementary research approach to understand the complexity of language and literacy learning from the learner&#8216;s perspectives. To this end the following research questions have been posed. 1. What can learners&#8216; stories tell about the long-term processes of language and literacy learning? 2. What role can written autobiographical narrative play in processes of language learning? 3. What is the potential contribution of narrative inquiry to research in the field of language and literacy learning? In addressing these questions, I have drawn on socio-cultural and narrative theory to undertake a longitudinal study of two language learners/users &#8211; Satoko, a young Chinese-Japanese woman, and myself. Thus, the study comprises Satoko&#8216;s biographical study and my own autobiographical study, in which I am simultaneously the subject and the object of inquiry. I have analysed how processes of becoming bilingual for both of us were represented in autobiographical narratives, and, in turn, how the act of writing autobiographical narratives mediated ways in which we learned to become bilingual. By utilising narrative inquiry, I have attempted to broaden the locus of research into language and literacy learning from language development to learner development. A feature of the research design implemented in the thesis is its layered approach to narrative construction and analysis. This approach has enabled me to provide detailed insights into the complex interrelationships between linguistic and non-linguistic dimensions of language learning.

Knowledge and attitudes at the end of primary school were compared with those after four years of secondary school in three nations, Australia. The Philippines and Zimbabwe, involving 1296 surveys and 188 interviews. The investigation draws on earlier work in Ireland (Regan, 1996). and is a response to the recent emphasis on the role of schools in development education in Europe (Lemmers, 2001) and the call for a greater emphasis in Australia on this area (Simons. Hart and WTalsh, 1997). The survey compared student understanding with current 'knowledge' in the literature and the interview allowed an examination of the stories students constructed about people in poverty, including their cognitive and affective responses to people in poverty. Results showed that whilst almost all students recognised that poverty exists, they were more likely to define it simply as a lack of income than as a phenomenon involving social power and self esteem. Few students were aware that the majority of the world's poor are female. Nationality was an important predictor of student knowledge and values. Australian students considered nationally based causes (e.g., government, education) to be more important than personal qualities (e.g., laziness) or international causes (e.g., powerful countries). Australian students were also more likely to value hedonism, but it could not be demonstrated conclusively that this affected the ways that they defined poverty and its causes. Filipino students were more likely to perceive poverty as being the fault of the person experiencing poverty and were more pejorative towards the poor.  Whilst Filipino and Zimbabwean students considered that they had learnt a lot about poverty, few Australian students thought this to be the case. Students in senior secondary school were not well informed of current understandings about poverty and development and did not possess a significantly greater knowledge than primary school students on these matters. Specifically. current school practices allow students to perceive poverty as primarily income related and do not place due emphasis on internationally related causes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty - Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">High schools - Australia</field><field name="subject">High schools - Zimbabwe</field><field name="subject">High schools - Philippines</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and characterization of multipath fading channels in cellular mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Khan, Noor Muhammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the enormous capacity and performance gains associated with the use of antenna arrays in wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication links, it is inevitable that these technologies will become an integral part of future systems. In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Arab as spectacle: race, gender and representation in Australian popular culture</field><field name="creator">Abood, Paula, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis, The Arab as Spectacle, is about representation. It is about the limits and the contradictions of representation. It is about the burden and the violence of representation. It is about the persistence of Orientalism and how the hierarchies of race and gender intersect with discourses on sexuality to inform and inflect the representation of Arabs in contemporary literary and media spheres of Australian popular culture. This thesis comprises two sections. Part One is a research dissertation that explores the strategies, devices and parameters of the representation of Arabic culture and identities through close readings of specific texts. This theoretical project inaugurates the second part of my study which takes up the question of the contradictions of representation through a collection of ficto-critical writings. Through these satirical narratives, I seek to expose and disrupt the hegemony of Orientalist representations that proliferate in English language literature and news media by bringing into focus the inherent paradox of representation, working within and against Orientalist representational traditions. In so doing, it is not my aim to 'correct' the Orientalist logic and imagery that I theorise in the first part of this thesis, but rather to undermine the spurious truth-value of Orientalist representations by deploying the literary weapons of satire, parody and irony. In this way, my fiction works to engage creatively and critically with the very tropes that I theorise in my research dissertation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orientalism.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Arabs in popular culture -- Western countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developmental trajectories into substance use in adolescence</field><field name="creator">McAloon, Thomas John, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal developmental characteristics of the association between mental health and substance use. N=1182 adolescents aged between 11 and 20 years were recruited from schools in Australia. Participants completed the Youth Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach, 1991a) and reported on their use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, their social ability, their motivation for using substances, their ability to regulate emotion, and the influences of their parents and peers on their substance use. N=561 of time one participants were retained for testing one year later to assess the potential to predict substance use at time two from mental health at time one. Results indicated a clear and consistent cross-sectional association between externalising scores on the YSR and use of the three substances, regardless of gender. The relation between internalising scores and substance use was non-significant. When the relation between externalising scores and substance use was assessed for mediation, only the influence of parents and peers was found to be significant. A cross-sectional structural model developed to account for this association was demonstrated to be invariant across the three substances of interest, and across gender, but not age category. There was no evidence that social skills, emotion regulation, or substance use motives, had roles in mediating the relationship between mental health and substance use. A model was developed to assess the potential to predict substance use at time two from externalising scores at time one. Results showed that externalising scores predicted increases in alcohol use via parent and peer attitudes. Thus, externalising disposition, in the context of a facilitative social environment, was predictive of an increase in alcohol use over time. Structural models developed to account for the predictive relation between externalising scores and use of cigarettes and marijuana  proved unstable and could not be tested. Substance use at time one was not predictive of externalising scores at time two. The results of the present research are discussed in relation to their potential to inform the developmental substance use literature, and efforts directed against the development of substance use problems.

The                 (re)productions and transmissions of Polish identity formations, and the acts of remembrance, are multifarious by nature, and I have examined them in two distinctly different settings ?? in public spheres in Poland, and in the private realms of Australian Polish diaspora.  In this thesis, these research settings have been conceptualised as the conduits through which Polish identities are maintained.  Polish identity is theorised using a constructivist approach; Polish identities are therefore positioned historically and geographically.  Their performances are fluid: they move through time and across spaces.  The active maintenance of Polish identity developed as a result of foreign occupations.  The partitioning of Poland by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires lasted 123 years.  From 1795 to 1918 the Polish nation was expunged.  Following a brief period of independence between World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII), Poland was again occupied by Nazi and Soviet regimes during WWII (1939-1945).  The Soviet occupation continued after WWII with the Soviet-supported Polish government that lasted until 1989.  Under occupation ?? particularly during WWII ?? Poland suffered events that have been indelibly imprinted within Polish cultural memory.  The macabre nature of this era included the incursion of hegemonic regimes on political and everyday social life, as well as the atrocities for which it is well known.  An important outcome of these occupations has been the division of discourses of Polishness, and their remembrances, into distinctly public and private spheres.  These periods of foreign occupation brought various attempts to suppress and eliminate Polishness: the cultures and identifications of Polish people.  Suppression particularly occurred in public spheres through the prohibition of the Polish language, and by investing the public memory landscape with ideologies that represented the new regimes.  By repressing public commemorations of Polish cultural narratives, a new history was written at the expense of the Polish experience.  There have been two primary responses to these repressions of Polishness.  These responses initially developed during the partitioned period to ensure that Polish language and cultural practices were maintained.  First, a narrative and tradition of resistance emerged in reaction to the Russian, Prussian and Austrian partitions.  It was enacted through military participation in insurrections and through the production of patriotic Romantic Era cultural artefacts, both of which strengthened linkages to the Polish Catholic faith.  Second, Polish cultural practices and language were safeguarded in the private spheres of home.  It was in private settings, in Poland and within the diaspora in Australia, that memories and experiences of occupation were passed on and through generations.  In Poland, such narratives were often maintained in resistance to those imposed by foreign occupiers and because of the inability to commemorate events of Poland??s macabre past in public.  In Australia, identity maintenance has occurred to resist the dissolution of Polishness in a diasporic and multicultural environment.  This thesis demonstrates the utility of studying cultural memories as a means of understanding how identity maintenance can occur in the face of adversities, such as the multiple foreign occupations that occurred in Poland, and in diaspora.  Moreover, it exemplifies the diverse paths of identity maintenance in different contexts.  This thesis shows that despite the distinctive character of both Polish public and private spheres, Polish identities have been informed, shaped and maintained through culturally-enacted memory (re)production.  This process is exhibited in the present ?? in Poland and through the diaspora ?? and it occurred despite the repressive aims of various foreign occupiers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polishness</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Polish -- Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provision of environmental goods on private land: a case study of Australian wetlands</field><field name="creator">Whitten, Stuart Max, Business, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The management of natural resources located on private lands often involves a perceived conflict between the mix of private and public benefit outputs they produce. Governments have tended to respond through legislation to restrict and redirect private decisions about resource management. However, the legislative response faces a lack of information about the costs and benefits of alternative management and policy instruments. A pertinent example of this debate is the management of wetlands on private lands.  The goal in this thesis is to advance the design of policy relating to the production of environmental outputs on private lands. This goal is achieved by first estimating the welfare impacts of alternative private land management strategies on the wider community. These estimates are used as inputs into the development of alternative policy instruments that are then evaluated in terms of their potential cost-effectiveness in influencing private management. Two case studies of wetland management on private land in Australia are presented ??? the Upper South East Region of South Australia, and, the Murrumbidgee River Floodplain in New South Wales.  The conceptual approach described in the first part of the thesis includes a description of the resource management problem and the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative decision frameworks widely employed in Australia. Identification of the cause and nature of transaction costs in the management process is the focus in this discussion.  The welfare impacts of alternative wetland management strategies are investigated through the construction of a bio-economic model for each of the case study areas. The approach integrates biophysical analysis of changing wetland management with the value society places on wetlands. Outputs from this process are used in the development of a range of policy instruments directed towards influencing wetland management. The impact of poorly quantified and uncertain transaction costs on the potential cost-effectiveness of these options is evaluated using threshold policy analysis.  The empirical results show that the perception of a conflict between the private and public values generated by resource management is accurate. For example, scenarios changing wetland management in the Upper South East of South Australia on the Murrumbidgee River floodplain in New South Wales were shown to generate net benefits of $5.2m and $5.1m respectively. Hence, changing wetland management could generate increased community welfare. The potential for these findings to be translated into wetland policy is less conclusive. Policies directed towards wetland management (in part or in whole) incur a range of transaction costs and deliver differential wetland protection benefits. Ten ???best bet??? policies are identified, but more information is required to determine conclusively whether a net benefit results to the wider community when transaction costs are included.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transaction costs</field><field name="subject">benefit-cost analysis</field><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">public goods</field><field name="subject">environmental economics</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="subject">bio-economic modelling</field><field name="subject">policy selection</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting the ageing aircraft challenge</field><field name="creator">Crowley, Christopher Keith, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">&amp;quotMeeting the ageing aircraft challenge&amp;quot is not just about safety, not just about effectiveness, and not just about economy of support. It is about proactive and reactive optimization of all three service goals throughout long life cycles that span 20 or 30 years, or more, and typically, beyond the originally intended design life.  It is therefore about organizational attitudes towards ongoing trend analysis and condition monitoring, and pervading cost benefit assessments of all forms of human innovation across what the author describes as 'the eight sustaining disciplines for long aerospace life cycles', including scientific and technological developments, and opportunities for reliability growth or 'refresh'. Complacency is the root cause of all problems with the design, maintenance and support of all modern infrastructure, and therefore life cycle planners and minders are required to be an enthusiastic but nervous lot - always hoping for the best, but planning for the worst impact of 'Mr Murphy'. Murphy thrives on complacency, is in bed with uncertainty, and never forgets (as we do often) that imperfection (no matter how small) breeds unreliability traps that patiently wait to surprise at some stage along the life cycle journey. He has the upper hand.  ...Our best weapons against Murphy are continual, total picture and longer-term situational awareness; caution, vigilance, innovation and collaboration.  This research study and thesis is intended as a broad and comprehensive management philosophy, a guide and checklist - a broad scrape of everything 'so deep', rather than coverage of any one-niche aspect of the ageing aircraft challenge in great depth. It includes a brief and simple strategic setting for Australian Military Aerospace requirements, and spans a three axes management philosophy: 1. a toolbox of eight sustaining disciplines, 2. trend analysis and 3. time-cost-benefit assessment.  Along with complacency, the prime ageing aircraft 'killers' are identified, as are the key ageing aircraft 'age multipliers'. The eight sustaining disciplines are explained in varying depth, according to their broad significance to the ageing aircraft condition and life cycle. The ever-ubiquitous bathtub reliability curve - the key to understanding, predicting and controlling life cycle behaviour (including costs) - is emphasized.  Engineering life cycle minding and capability management are broad focus areas. The eight areas of attention identified for this broad study are:  1.	  Aerospace design requirements and trends, 2.	  Science and technology opportunities, 3.	  Airworthiness, engineering and maintenance philosophy, 4.	  Reliability behaviour, 5.	  Operational use and abuse patterns, 6.	  Logistics support and managing obsolescence, 7.	  Technical workforce and organizational attitudes (requirements and outlook), and 8.	  Life cycle costing and budgeting. This thesis primarily draws attention to the fundamental driver of life cycle behaviour - reliability. The critical dependency that life cycle control and prediction has on consistent and high quality trend data collection and analysis is emphasized throughout, and the now pressing need for better identification of ageing aircraft cost growth drivers, and their containment, is linked to reliability trend awareness, manipulation and intervention. The human dimension is included - including coverage of organizational attitudes and what it takes to be a 'high reliability organization'.  There are no magic or easy answers to the ageing aircraft condition and challenge. Trend analysis has to be done from the bottom up, system by system, for each fleet type. But over time, with consistent trend data collection, patterns emerge within the sophisticated and stochastic systems behaviour that that ageing aircraft play out. These patterns enable ongoing management of the long life cycle to be more confidently predicted, more assured and with best possible cost growth containment. The best, perhaps only, path to least surprises and best cost containment is now being re-identified in some military aviation organizations as a mature and evolving RAM engineering and RCM framework. RAM-RCM may well be the only recovery from what some admit is a death spiral of ageing aircraft cost growth.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">airplanes</field><field name="subject">Military</field><field name="subject">life cycle costing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GPS study for resolving the stability of Borobudur temple site</field><field name="creator">Lestari, Dwi, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The maintenance of the world???s important cultural monuments is a complex task embracing many disciplines. One important aspect of individual management plans is the stability of the monument. Borobudur, in Central Java, uncovered in a state of dilapidation in the early nineteenth century and finally restored in the second half of the twentieth century was restored using internal beams and injection technology with the view of providing a stable foundation for the foreseeable future. In the past, classical surveying separated the vertical and horizontal components. This separation often resulted in different stations having different information. Moreover, one technique was not generally able to add constraints to the other. Today's surveyors and Cultural Heritage managers use the Global Positioning System which is able to provide precise and reliable information for both the horizontal and vertical components, thereby unifying the networks and maximizing individual strengths, especially the underground marks associated with precise leveling, which are significantly less prone to local erratic movement than surface marks. Of necessity, any measurement of change involves at least two observation epochs. In general the precision is tied to the number of epochs and the span between the epochs. Since this study has had only two observation epochs, the results can only be described as preliminary or indicative. Never the less, there are a number of clear trends that are apparent. The first important point is that GPS is able to deliver precisions that are near 1 mm in the horizontal and 2-3 mm in the vertical relative to a regional fiducial control network. This is comparable to terrestrial surveying techniques. Moreover, it is accomplished in 10 to 14 days compared to many weeks for leveling. The second is that the level of redundancy and spatial coherence is very high enabling errors and outliers to be readily detected. This was used extensively as part of the quality assurance program adopted in this study. The third point is that no alarming deformation of the temple has been detected. At this stage of the study, the 95% confidence levels are quite large due mainly to only 2 epochs being observed but also in part to the way the models, especially the GLOBK model, has been implemented due to the limited number of epochs and the limited time span. It is expected that the model of tectonic motion which connects one epoch to the next will improve dramatically with a third epoch, and this will significantly improve the precision of the observation stations on the temple at the stupa level and on the buttress level. However, there is already clear evidence that some of the buttress level stations are in an unstable environment compared with stupa level stations and this is primarily due to their location. Finally, GPS offers the prospect of fast and hence repeatable work. Kinematic GPS techniques can certainly be used to densify stations and to increase our knowledge of the structural effects of deformation. However, much needs to be done to ensure that satellite tracking is of high quality and able to successfully resolve the ambiguities on an epoch by epoch basis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene profiling in soft tissue sarcoma: predictive value of EGFR in sarcoma tumour progression and survival</field><field name="creator">Das Gupta, Paromita, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite improvements in the clinical management of soft tissue sarcomas (STS), 50% of patients will die of metastatic disease that is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The aims of this study were to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in progressive and metastatic STS. In addition to this, cell lines from fresh tumours were initiated and established, thus increasing the repository of cell lines available for functional studies. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of STS have thus far not resulted in the use of molecular markers for clinical prognostication. Identifying novel genes and pathways will lead to molecular diagnostic methods to better stratify prognostic groups and could identify cellular targets for more efficacious treatments. Gene expression profiling of sarcoma cell lines of increasing metastatic potential revealed over-expression of genes involved in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) pathways. Factors involved in invasion and metastasis such as integrins and MMPs were over-expressed in the cell lines with higher metastatic potential. The developmental Notch pathway and cell cycle regulators were also dysregulated. NDRG1 was significantly over-expressed in the high grade sarcoma cell line, a novel finding in sarcomas. The expression of EGFR, NDRG1 and other genes from the above pathways was validated using quantitative RT-PCR in real time (qRT-PCR). A tissue microarray (TMA) comprising STS of varying tumour grades was constructed for high throughput assessment of target proteins. EGFR, its activated form and its signal transducers were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Activated EGFR (HR 2.228, p &lt; 0.001) and phosphorylated Akt (HR 2.032, p = 0.003) were found to be independent predictors of overall survival and both correlated with tumour grade. Of the several STS cultures initiated and maintained, two of these cell lines were fully characterised in terms of cytogenetics, telomerase and alternate lengthening of 5 telomeres (ALT) status, KIT and TP53 mutation and the expression of certain biomarkers using both qRT-PCR and IHC. In summary, transcript profiling identified several potential biomarkers of tumour progression and metastasis in STS. Crucially, activated EGFR and pAkt were found in a cohort of STS samples to correlate with clinical outcome, identifying them as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in the treatment of STS. Activated EGFR can be used as a diagnostic marker for patient selection, as well as for target effect monitoring. Furthermore, the cell lines established in this project will serve as valuable tools in future preclinical studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activated EGFR</field><field name="subject">soft tissue sarcoma</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">gene expression profiling</field><field name="subject">tissue microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photocatalytic reduction of selenate and selenite : water/wastewater treatment and the formation of nano-selenium compounds</field><field name="creator">Tan, Thatt Yang Timothy, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current work investigates the photocatalytic reduction of selenium (Se) ions, selenate Se(VI) and selenite Se(IV), from two perspectives: Se ion removal from water and wastewater and the formation of nano-Se compounds. Se ion pollution has become an environmental issue in recent years, and hence there is an urgent need for an efficient removal technique. In addition, there is increasing interest in the formation of nano-size semiconductors for niche applications. Since Se is a semiconductor, its formation onto the semiconductor TiO2 could lead to the discovery of new composite materials. The current study has successfully elucidated the mechanism of Se ions reduction by photocatalysis. Factors such as the simultaneous adsorption of the Se ions (the electron scavenger in this case) and a suitable organic compound (the hole scavenger), and the chemical properties of the hole scavenger were crucial for effective and efficient Se ions photoreduction. Optimum conditions in relation to pH, concentrations and types of hole scavenger were reported and discussed. It was also found that stoichiometric adsorption ratio of formate and selenate resulted to optimum photoreduction rate. A modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model that considered the simultaneous adsorption of both solutes was derived. The current investigation has also seen the successful formation Se deposits of different morphologies onto the TiO2 particles. Discrete Se particles of various sizes in the nano-size range as well as a Se film were deposited onto the TiO2 particles under different initial experimental conditions. The Se-TiO2 composite semiconductor was explored for the removal of cadmium Cd2+ ions, which resulted in the formation of CdSe-TiO2 systems. The photoreduction of Se ions using silver-modified TiO2 showed the enhanced reduction of Se ions to Se2- in the form of H2Se gas. It is suggested that the H2Se gas generated from the current photoreduction process could be used as a safer and cheaper technique in the formation of Se-compounds such copper selenide, cadmium selenide and zinc selenide. All these compounds were widely used in optical and semiconducting devices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Selenites</field><field name="subject">Selenium compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of Thrombospondin 1 Structure / Function by Intramolecular Thiol-Disulfide Isomerization</field><field name="creator">Hotchkiss, Kylie A, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) is a 450 kDa homotrimeric multidomain glycoprotein with fundamental roles in many cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. These varied, and sometimes conflicting, functions are mediated by specific domains in TSP1. One region with diverse biological roles is the Ca2+ binding loops (or type 3 repeats). The biological activity of this region is determined through a complex assembly of disulfide bonds linking structure and function. Disulfide interchange in a protein is usually very specific and quite slow, unless catalysed. I have found that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is expressed on the surface of platelets and endothelial cells in a reduced active conformation. The presence of enzymatically active PDI on the surface of TSP1-secreting cells suggests PDI is well positioned to catalyse disulfide interchange in, and regulate the structure/function relationships of, TSP1. PDI was observed to form disulfide-linked complexes with TSP1. Moreover, incubation of platelet or fibroblast TSP1 with PDI enhanced binding of an isomer-specific anti-TSP1 antibody whose epitope is in the Ca2+ binding loops. These findings suggest that PDI may mediate disulfide bond rearrangement in both the soluble and extracellular matrix-bound forms of TSP1. TSP1 is a tight-binding competitive inhibitor of neutrophil cathepsin G; however, incubation with PDI increased the Ki for the interaction ???10-14-fold. TSP1 bound platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) tightly in the region of the Ca2+ binding loops and supported binding of PDGF to its receptor. PDI-mediated disulfide interchange in TSP1 ablated PDGF binding, indicating that PDI-catalysed disulfide interchange in TSP1 may modulate PDGF-TSP1 complex formation and the biological activity of PDGF. Finally, PDI-catalysed isomerization of TSP1 potently affected its cell adhesive properties. Treatment of TSP1 with PDI enhanced adhesion and spreading of endothelial cells through the ??v??3 integrin receptor to TSP1, by exposure of a cryptic RGD sequence. Thus, endothelial cell surface PDI may be a physiological regulator of RGD-dependent binding to TSP1. These data suggest that cell-surface PDI may regulate the disulfide-bonded structure and certain biological functions of TSP1. In conclusion, I propose a novel mechanism for the post-translational regulation of TSP1 structure/function, which in turn may regulate certain aspects of TSP1 in vascular biology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thrombospondin  1</field><field name="subject">Protein disulfide isomerase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The health, wellbeing and work satisfaction of New South Wales?? correctional officers: a pilot study of randomly selected correctional officers in one NSW prison</field><field name="creator">Bond, Lynley Jane Mackay, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract: The role of correctional officers has undergone rapid changes in response to increased prisoner populations and professionalization of the workforce to respond to more diverse prisoner issues and problems, including high levels of prisoners with substance abuse and mental health issues, ageing prisoners, and increased prisoner cultural diversity.  Research into prisoner health has resulted in the implementation of strategies and some improvements in prisoner health.  However there has been no corresponding research into the health of correctional officers. The last comprehensive research into correctional officer health was conducted by Webster et al[1] in 1982.  Recently, in 2002, the New South Wales Auditor General raised correctional officers?? sick leave as an issue of concern.  This pilot study tested a questionnaire which included some comparison questions with Webster??s study, as well as researching some more recent health issues.  The questionnaire appeared overall to be valid and user friendly, and would be suitable for a larger study, albeit with minor alterations.  The results of the research, as expected of a small pilot study (n=30) generated more questions than answers, and raised areas to be tested in a larger research study.  Some results of this study were a reduction in correctional officer smoking levels from 1982 (Webster 44.3%, Australian population 39.1%), and a lower rate of smoking at 13%  than the general male population in Australia in 2004, at 18.6%.  Job satisfaction was almost twice as high as in 1982, yet correctional officers have almost half the level of occupational self esteem.   Correctional officers had higher levels of harmful alcohol consumption (10%,) than 1982 correctional officers (5%) and of the 2004 male population in Australia (7.5%), and the 1982 population (5%).  Occasional harmful alcohol consumption was almost twice as high amongst correctional officers (86%) than amongst other workers (42.8%).  A high percentage of correctional officers had been assaulted in the course of their work (76%), but few sought professional debriefing, with most preferring to discuss this with family members (54%) and co-workers (46%).  Although the mental health of correctional officers appears somewhat poorer than that of the general population, this, and any link between harassment or assault by prisoners and mental health and occupational self esteem and rewards requires further research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Correctional officer</field><field name="subject">Prison</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalyst for high temperature water gas shift reaction</field><field name="creator">Lei, Yun, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is focused on the study of high temperature water gas shift catalysis, the identification of new improved catalysts and the study of the kinetics and mechanism of reaction over these catalysts. Rh-promoted Fe2O3-Cr2O3 was found to offer best performance which was significantly better than unpromoted catalyst over wide temperatures range. An extensive literature survey is first reported. Guidelines to develop new WGS catalysts are developed. As a result, the activities of precious metals supported on various oxides for high temperature WGS reaction have been tested. Rh(1wt%) doped Fe2O3/Cr2O3, exhibits the highest activity for WGS over a wide temperature range. 5wt%CuO/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/U3O8, 1wt%Pt/10%U3O8-Al2O3 and 1wt%Pt/5%V2O5-TiO2 fall into the second most active catalysts group, with an improved activity compared to commercial Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalyst. It is clear that both the support/catalyst and the promoter can affect the efficiency of the WGS, leading to the obvious inference that the reaction rate is controlled at the promoter ??? support interface. Further kinetic studies and characterisation (TPR, TPD, pulse-adsorption (reaction)) on Rh/Fe3O4/Cr2O3 have been conducted. The study, conducted under conditions without inhibition from products of both forward and backward reactions, shows that the overall reaction rate expression is described as: 2 22 ??? =0.0041exp(???4042.6 ) 0.64 0.5 ???0.024 exp(???6022.9 ) 0.46 0.73 CO CO H O CO H r PP P P T T . Kinetics studies carried out under fuel reforming gas compositions shows that reaction rate expression changed when the temperature of reaction varied. The reaction rate equations at temperatures of 573K, 623K and 673K are derived as: 573K: 2 2 2 - 2.84 10-6 0.6 0.12 - 9.08 10-7 0.09 0.52 rCO = ?? PCO PH O ??

TPR, TPD, TPO characterisation studies and reoxidation of catalysts by CO2 or H2O show that the active site for high temperature WGS reaction on Rh/Fe2O3/Cr2O3 is reduced magnetite Fe3O4 which dissociatively breaks down the H2O to form H* and OH* and adsorbs CO2. The deposited metal, Rh, acts as a promoter by facilitating the uptake of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), desorption of H2 (at high temperature) and CO2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">iron oxides</field><field name="subject">chromium</field><field name="subject">catalysts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of petroleum exploration and development in India</field><field name="creator">Venugopal, Sajith, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides the background to and an analysis of the economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas discoveries in India. It is aimed at helping the oil and gas industry assess the financial attractiveness of investment in that country. The thesis describes the geography, climate, infrastructure, and energy market with an emphasis on how these affect upstream oil and gas industry investment. A detailed description and analysis is given of the petroleum production sharing contract (&amp;quotPSC&amp;quot) terms embodied in India's New Exploration Licensing Policy (&amp;quotNELP&amp;quot), and demonstrates that, depending on negotiations, Government Take under NELP terms is likely to be in the range 50% to 60% for a stand-alone petroleum development. However, PSC terms are regressive for marginal discoveries. In particular, State royalties might hinder the development of small or marginal discoveries and render them uneconomic. As an illustration, depending on the oil price, up to 6 MMbbls of oil in otherwise economically viable small fields in a geological basin might be made uneconomic and left stranded because of the effect of royalties. The thesis also analyses the economics of developing a sample of actual Indian oil and gas fields offshore the east and west coasts of the country in shallow and deep water. Onshore field developments are not analysed because of lack of data. All of the offshore developments analysed are profitable based on past and current economic conditions and knowledge. The majority are also relatively low-risk investments. Finally, the thesis evaluates the profitability of new oil and gas exploration and development offshore the east and west coasts of India. The required minimum size of new exploration prospects are in the range 10 to 17 MMbbls for oil prospects and 138 to 1,100 Bcf for gas prospects assuming a low probability of success. Once a new discovery is made, the required minimum economically developable reserves are 4 to 12 MMbbls for oil discoveries and 63 to 1,400 Bcf for gas discoveries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petroleum industry and trade</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">petroleum.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of amines and imines organometallic catalysts</field><field name="creator">Rumble, Sarah Louise, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the catalysed syntheses of amines and imines using organoiridium and organorhodium complexes with N-donor ligands as the catalysts. These catalysed syntheses were achieved via hydroamination, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation reactions, as well as tandem hydroamination/imine reduction reactions. An in situ catalysis study found that the most active catalysts for the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1) to give 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (4) were formed from a combination of catalyst components that resulted in an electron deficient metal centre, indicating that an alkyne binding mechanism was most likely. The kinetics of the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1), catalysed by the complexes [Rh(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (7), [Ir(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (8), [Rh(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (9),and [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) (bpm = bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane and bim = bis(Nmethylimidazol- 2-yl)methane) were modelled and compared. The nature of the metal centre was found to have the most influence on the rate of the product release step, while the nature of the N-donor ligand was found to have the most influence on the rate of the substrate binding step. The investigation of the catalysed hydroamination of the phenyl substituted alkynylamines 5-phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (2), 4-phenyl-3-butyn-1-amine (13) and 2- phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (34) revealed a difference in catalytic activity between the rhodium and iridium complexes depending on the alkyne substituent. A series of novel rhodium(I) complexes were synthesised: [RhClCO(Mes-DAD(Me))] (38), [RhClCO(Mes-BIAN)] (22), [Rh(COD)(Mes-BIAN)][BF4] (39), [Rh2(COD)2(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (40) and [Rh2(CO)4(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (41), where Mes- DAD(Me) = biacetylbis(2,4,6-trimethylphenylimine), Mes-BIAN = bis(2,4,6- trimethylphenylimino)acenapthene and bmimen = 1,2-bis[(1-methyl-2- imidazolyl)methylene-amino]ethane. The cationic complex 40 was found to be an active hydroamination catalyst, while the neutral complexes 38 and 22 were only active in the presence of the tetraphenylborate counterion. A range of imines was found to be efficiently reduced to their respective amines via hydrosilylation or hydrogenation using the iridium(I) complex [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) as catalyst. The hydrosilylation reaction was found to be significantly faster in a protic solvent (methanol), giving the desilylated amines without the need for a desilylation step. The mechanism of this reaction was proposed to involve a monohydride iridium(I) complex as a key intermediate. The tandem hydroamination/hydrosilylation of a series of alkynylamine substrates was achieved using the iridium complexes 8 and 10, in which the iridium complex catalyses the two mechanistically distinct reactions in the one-pot. Catalysed tandem hydroamination/hydrogenation reactions were also achieved, but were less facile.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amines</field><field name="subject">organometallic catalysts</field><field name="subject">imines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the retention and progression of postgraduate business distance education students: an exploratory case study at the University of Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Carroll, David</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Universities have traditionally focused their efforts on recruiting new students and increasing participation rates.

This study is based on a qualitative exploratory research design comprising twenty semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with current and former students and university staff members. The key findings of this study indicate that a combination of situational, institutional and dispositional factors impact upon the retention and progression of postgraduate business distance education students. The employment and family commitments of students, whether students believed that their studies would benefit their career goals and the design of the distance education program appear to be the most important factors impacting upon student retention and progression. In contrast to the majority of services marketing literature, it would appear that student satisfaction is not a key factor impacting upon student retention and progression in this context. This research also provides a range of managerial implications and recommendations for postgraduate distance education providers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postgraduate;</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">students;</field><field name="subject">distance</field><field name="subject">education;</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">of</field><field name="subject">Southern</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">progression;</field><field name="subject">retention</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004922/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flight.</field><field name="creator">Harrow, Janet Gail</field><field name="description">Title page and synopsis only v.2; Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

They have been implicated in controlling various aspects of grape berry development, in particular, the important process of ripening and are used in some crops to control growth and ripening. Abscisic acid (ABA), is associated in grapevine with the response to water stress but may also have a role in berry ripening. We have shown over three seasons that ABA levels in Cabernet Sauvignon berries increase dramatically at veraison, consistent with it being involved either as a trigger for ripening or as a response to the increase in sugars that occurs at this time. Net ABA accumulation doesn't occur until veraison, the decrease in ABA concentration in the first phase of berry development being due to berry expansion. The decrease in ABA that occurs later in development is likely to be due to a combination of catabolism and sequestration into the bound form. The genes crucial to ABA synthesis, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), were expressed throughout berry development and no clear correlation was found between their levels and that of ABA. Laboratory studies have shown that isolated berries respond to the presence of sucrose through an increase in ABA biosynthesis pathway gene expression (NCED and ZEP). This resulted in de novo synthesis of ABA as inhibition of the carotenoid synthesis pathway by a phytoene desaturase inhibitor prevented ABA accumulation. Replicated field trials clearly showed that ABA treatments can be effective in significantly enhancing ripening when applied in at or near the end of the first period of berry expansion. Colour accumulation in the skins commenced earlier in ABA-treated fruit as did the increase in sugar levels. ABA treatment also advanced the timing of the second phase of berry expansion as it appeared to eliminate the lag phase of berry growth. Taken together these data demonstrate that ABA is likely to play some part in the control of berry ripening and can be used to advance the timing of ripening. Further investigation into the characteristics of ABA-treated fruit will be needed to investigate the compositional character of treated fruit and to gauge its suitability for winemaking. An ability to control the timing of ripening may provide considerable benefits to the wine industry in terms of wine style/quality and for winery scheduling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grape; berry; hormone; ABA; abscisic</field><field name="subject">Abscisic acid.</field><field name="subject">Viticulture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe: the centrality of M&#257;tauranga-a-iwi to M&#257;ori education.</field><field name="creator">Doherty, William</field><field name="description">The general aim of this thesis is to improve understanding about the place of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi in the education system. In the modern education system, the linked terms m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory are used to define M&#257;ori identity and M&#257;ori knowledge. But this thesis argues that these concepts must be grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located knowledge within tribal lands. It follows that m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, with their roots in m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, must ultimately be understood as a relationship between the tribal environment and its people. The tribal environment, or rohe, of T&#363;hoe is the illustrative site of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi for this thesis. The rohe for T&#363;hoe is Te Urewera. The relationship that exists between T&#363;hoe and this landscape is outlined mapping this intimate relationship (chapter 2). The thesis does the work of explaining what m&#257;tauranga-a-T&#363;hoe is, and how it has developed through a series of historical engagements. These things were learned by me at the feet of my grandmother (chapter 1). The engagements include: iwi interactions (chapter 6), Pakeha and Crown engagements (chapter 7), with more recent economic realities (chapter 4), and education (chapter 5). The key concepts of m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, and m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, as well as being grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located base, must be viewed as inseparable strands working collectively to enhance the understanding of the other. The indivisible strands are presented in a diagrammatic form (chapter 3). By mapping the complexities of what is m&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe (chapter 8) this thesis illustrates the level of detailed understanding that needs to be included in the education system in order for m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory to be properly understood and engaged for M&#257;ori educational success.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Emissions from Aluminium Electrolysis Cells</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Edwin Campbell</field><field name="description">Modern aluminium electrolysis cells generate between 15 to 40 kg fluoride per tonne of aluminium fluoride produced. This represent a large material recycle load, of which over 99% of this fluoride content is returned to the cell via a dry scrubbing system. Most past research has concentrated on increasing the efficiency of this end scrubbing system, neglecting the actual cause of the fluoride emissions. Lower emissions would reduce this loading, resulting in smaller scrubbing systems, and ultimately lower capital costs. Fluoride emissions also contribute to the changes in heat balance in the cell. The fluoride evolved represents a material loss that requires to be replaced with AlF3. The addition of this species is a major variable in cell heat balance instability [1]. Overall a better understanding of the contributors to fluoride generation in an aluminium cell would benefit the operation and economics of an aluminium smelter. Past studies [2-6] have identified most of the important emission contributors to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation. Two sources were shown to be significant. The most studied source was primary HF generation. This is HF generation from electrolytic reactions between constituents of the fluoride based electrolyte and water from the fed alumina and hydrogen in the anode. Overlooked in some studies were generation reactions outside the electrolyte - defined in this study as secondary HF generation. This source was found to occur mainly from hydrolysis reactions with the generated particulate fluorides. However the results and the relative contributions from these studies are not strictly applicable to the current generation scenario. The present smelting practices and technology, dry scrubbing technology and raw material specifications differ substantially from those used during the period of each past investigation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify emission sources for the current smelter technology and practices. This used controlled laboratory based studies of the individual generation sources complemented by in plant studies analysing the HF emission from production aluminium electrolysis cells. It was shown that the main contributor to primary HF generation is the addition of water to the electrolyte from the feed alumina. This results in the cyclic short term variations in HF emission, which correlate to the rate of alumina addition to the cell. Laboratory and industrial studies show that only a fraction of the added water reacts. The water reacted is likely the structural water of the alumina. The adsorbed water is thought to be flashed off before addition to the bath. Depending on feeding technology and crust integrity, between 10 to 50% of this water can react. This produces 7 to 14 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the most significant emission component. The remainder of this structural water is either entrained in the anode gases or forms part of the electrolyte dissolved water content. Dissolved water generation is the second most significant primary generation contributor, and third most significant emission component. Dissolved water is in equilibrium with the alumina content of the bath. It represents a constant emission source. Depending on feeding technology and cell design, the emission can vary between 3 to 10 kgF/tonneAl. The final primary HF emission contributor results from electrolytic generation of the hydrogen content of the anode. Laboratory studies found the emission to have a reaction efficiency of approximately 10%. This results in a small emission, of 2 &#8211; 5 kg/tonneAl. The remainder of the hydrogen content is expected to be entrained in the anode gases, as the generation of this CO/CO2 mixture is an order of magnitude greater than the HF generation reaction. Secondary generation of hydrogen fluoride is also a significant HF emission source. In an industrial cell this results from mainly thermal hydrolysis of the particulate fluoride emissions at the crust&#8211;air interface. Laboratory studies have shown that other identified secondary emission sources are unlikely due to the ambient conditions and feeding practices in a modern prebake aluminium electrolysis cell. Hence previously proposed generation from hydrolysis of the particulates in the ducts and desorption of the surface fluoride from the fed secondary alumina, have been found to be insignificant compared to the main HF generation sources. The thermal hydrolysis emission contributor is the only significant secondary generation emission component. Industrial measurements show that it varies with ambient humidity and crust integrity, two parameters which vary constantly in a modern prebake anode cell. Measurements show that the emission from this source is responsible for 2 to 8 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the second highest HF emission component. Control of the crust condition and feeder hole states reduces this component significantly. Hence in a modern prebake aluminium cell, the most significant operational factors affecting emission are related mainly to secondary generation. Industrial measurements show that the long term variations in an emission result from changes in the ambient humidity and the cells crust cover. Control of the crust integrity is thus paramount in reducing such variations. This relates both to normal operation and batch operations. Reduction of all other sources of emission are a material composition problem. Simply reducing the water content (LOI(300) and LOI(1000)) and reducing the hydrogen content of the anodes will reduce the emission. However material considerations affect other aspects of cell operation and hence these factors are not as simple to adjust.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity projects and positive youth development: the importance of efficacy, integrity and belonging during ddolescence</field><field name="creator">Bullen, Patricia L.</field><field name="description">Theory and research have indicated that well-being can be enhanced via the fulfilment of three key well-being concerns or needs, namely efficacy, integrity, and belonging. This thesis used a positive youth development framework to explore well-being concern experiences within the context of a young person&#8217;s most salient activities and goals, referred to here as identity projects (Harr&#233;, 2007). Guided by an adaptation of the identity project model (Harr&#233;, 2007), using a longitudinal design, this thesis incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how identity projects were negotiated during adolescence; what impact well-being concerns had on commitment to projects; and how this related to subjective well-being (SWB). In the quantitative study, 162 ethnically diverse Year 12 high school students participated at time one (T1); and one year later 87 students took part at time two (T2). Participants completed an adaptation of the Personal Project Analysis tool (Little, 1983), and two independent measures of SWB. The main foci of the quantitative study were to explore the predictive value of each well-being concern to project commitment and SWB; and to investigate if commitment mediated the link between well-being concerns and SWB. For the qualitative study, narrative interviews were conducted among 16 adolescents at three time points &#8211; Years 12 and 13, and after completing high school. The main foci of the interviews were to investigate how well-being concerns were voiced within the context of specific projects; and to gain insight into how projects were negotiated during life transitions. The quantitative results showed efficacy and integrity, but not belonging, were predictors of concurrent commitment at T1 and actual commitment to T1 projects at T2. The mediating role of commitment (between the well-being concerns and SWB) was, however, not supported. Instead, each well-being concern directly predicted different aspects of SWB, and these relationships changed over time. Overall, experiences of efficacy and belonging, within identity projects, enhanced SWB in the short term, while only experiences of integrity enhanced SWB, namely life satisfaction, in the long term. The qualitative results indicated experiences of efficacy and belonging were most prevalent within leisure pursuits, while integrity was most commonly discussed within education and career projects.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescent Development, Positive Youth Development, Positive Psychology, Personal Projects, Personal Goals, Identity Projects, Well-being Concerns, Psychological Needs, Efficacy, Competence, Belonging, Relatedness, Integrity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical edition of The triumphant widow, or, The medley of humours by William Cavendish and Thomas Shadwell</field><field name="creator">Hoare, Sally Ann</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 03/2012, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fairness, forgiveness and grudge-holding: experimental studies with primary school children in New Zealand : thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yamaguchi, Tomoko</field><field name="description">Fairness, forgiveness and grudge-holding are concepts which underlie many aspects of our interpersonal relationships. Fairness is the foundation of our day-to-day communication with others and forgiveness is concerned with a positive strategy used to manage negative emotional experiences of underserved [i.e. undeserved] unfair treatment. Grudge-holding results as an accumulation of negative feelings, which are associated with the original experience of unfairness. Two experimental studies investigated children&#8217;s perceptions of, feelings about, and reactions towards the unfair behaviour of a mother and a friend, by individually inviting the children to scenario-based interview sessions, which included three imaginary tasks. The children were asked to judge the fairness of a mother and a best friend&#8217;s treatment towards a child protagonist and to report their associated feelings, after listening to a scenario that described an interaction between a child and a mother and an interaction between a child and a friend. They further responded to three scenario-based experimental tasks, regarding their willingness to grant forgiveness, as opposed to expressions of hostility. In the first study, the children&#8217;s willingness to forgive, as a result of unfairness, was explored with 82 local primary school children in Palmerston North, New Zealand, whose ages ranged from 8- to 11-years-old, in addition to 50 parents of these participating children. The parents also completed a questionnaire about their approaches to their children&#8217;s common misbehaviours. The study found that the children were typically willing to grant forgiveness to a mother, even though she had been unfair. Their forgiveness tendencies were not related to aspects of parental disciplinary behaviour. However, an examination of the children&#8217;s verbatim responses through the use of thematic analysis revealed the complex nature of the relationship between parent and child concerning tolerance for mistakes. In the second study, I explored on whether the children&#8217;s repeated exposure to unfairness would contribute to their display of grudge-holding against a mother or a best friend in the scenarios and this investigation involved 55 local primary children, whose ages ranged from 8- to 12-years-old, in Wellington, New Zealand. The children participated in individual scenario-based interview sessions, which included three imaginary tasks over the two time periods, one week apart from each other. The children&#8217;s levels of grudge-holding was measured by analysing the possible increase in hostility, which the children expressed from Time 1 to Time 2. The study showed that a repeated experience of unfairness had a noticeable effect on the children&#8217;s level of hostility towards the person who was unfair and especially towards the best friend. The children&#8217;s verbatim comments also suggested some evidence of accumulated negativity in their responses to an unfairness experience. Thus, this study proved to be a suitable paradigm for operationalising grudge-holding in children.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">negative feelings</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Execution costs in money and futures markets</field><field name="creator">Kruk, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Futures markets</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual writing : a critique of graphic devices in hybrid novels, from a visual communication design perspective.</field><field name="creator">Sadokierski, Zoe</field><field name="description">This thesis examines hybrid novels &#8211; novels in which graphic devices like photographs, drawings and experimental typography are integrated into the written text. Within hybrid novels, word and image combine to create a text that is neither purely written, nor purely visual. Although not new, hybrid novels are increasingly appearing in commercial publishing, and increasingly recognised as an insufficiently explained phenomenon by both literary critics and academics. Book reviews and essays show that readers and critics accustomed to conventional novels can find hybrid novels perplexing. They ask: What are these images? What are they doing in novels? How does one &#8216;read&#8217; them? These questions point to the need for new approaches to the analysis and critique of hybrid texts, approaches that account for the interplay between words and images. This thesis proposes that Visual Communication Designers &#8211; those versed in both the verbal and the visual &#8211; offer useful analytical tools and critique for the study of hybrid texts. So the research asks: How could a designer&#8217;s particular knowledge of wordimage interplay explain the function of graphic devices in hybrid novels? A preliminary study of fifteen hybrid novels develops: criteria for identifying hybrid novels; a typology of graphic devices in hybrid novels &#8211; photographs, illustrative elements, unconventional typesetting, ephemera and diagrams; and a set of analytical tools to critique the effectiveness of the graphic devices in hybrid novels. Then, a primary study uses the analytical tools to critique the graphic devices in three exemplar hybrid novels: Jonathan Safran Foer&#8217;s Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Steven Hall&#8217;s The Raw Shark Texts and Dave Egger&#8217;s You Shall Know Our Velocity. This thesis is practice-led in that an issue identified through my design practice led to the research, and analytical and critical tools derived from practice are applied as research methods. The research also draws upon a theoretical framework from the emergent field of Visual Studies, where scholars call for the interdisciplinary study of hybrid texts in a critically acute and widely accessible way. Finally, this thesis is itself a hybrid text; a combination of graphic devices and writing form parts of the argument.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hybrid novels.</field><field name="subject">Visual communication.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change and continuity : the influences of Taoist philosophy and cultural practices on contemporary art practice</field><field name="creator">Ely, Bonita</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to identify in contemporary art practices the inflections that have either direct, or indirect origins in Taoism, the conceptual source of China&#8217;s principle indigenous, cultural practices. The thesis argues that the increasingly cross cultural qualities of contemporary art practice owe much to the West&#8217;s exposure to Taoism&#8217;s non-absolutist, non-humanist tropes, a cultural borrowing that has received slight attention despite its increasingly pervasive presence. This critical analysis is structured by Deleuze and Guattari&#8217;s theory of the rhizome as a metaphor for cultural influences that are pluralist permeations, rather than a linear hierachy. The thesis tracks discourse between the West and China from early contact to the present, tracing manifold aspects of Taoism&#8217;s modes of visual representation in Western art. Chinese gardens, Chinoiserie, calligraphy, and their coalescence in Chinese painting, are analysed to locate Taoist precepts familiar to the West, principally citing the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, Taoism&#8217;s founder. Here Taoist philosophy, as synthesised in Western thought, is proven to be a source of identifiable innovations in contemporary art practice. For example, spatial articulation as a dominant element of expression in installation art is traced to Western artists&#8217; exposure to the conceptualised spatiality of Sinocised artefacts. Taoist precepts are analysed in the Chinese tradition of improvising upon calligraphic characters as a key factor.This model is deployed using the skills set of studio-based research, to identify the experimental nature and degree of improvisation in Western artists&#8217; adaptations of Taoist methods in innovative painting, then sculpture. Investigations of artworks are structured upon correlations between Deleuze&#8217;s theories of representation and Taoist theories of creativity. A thematic connection with Taoism located in contemporary art, namely, notions of continuity and change, assists this detailed unravelling of creative processes, aesthetics, metonymy and meaning derived from Taoism in global, contemporary art.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art, Modern</field><field name="subject">Taoist influences</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">Taoism</field><field name="subject">East and West</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/40805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of graphic symbol use by students with severe intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Stephenson, J.

The theoretical part in this thesis investigates the following issues: the entitlement failure model, the defence spending allocation model and the terror cycles model. The empirical part focuses on the following: the CMP, the beta-index and beta-mobility idea, and the relation between economic inequality and violent social conflicts. The thesis argues that the introduction of market ethos and democratisation in developing nations has created a fragile economic and social system. It demonstrates the existence of a political equilibrium that maximises the probability of re-election of an incumbent government. This demonstrates the existence of a region of capital allocation such that if the optimal allocation of capital lies in this specific region there does not arise any distribution failure. In the second part we highlight two types of conflicts, namely market conflicts and political conflicts and attempt to weave them together to illuminate an important intersection between the economy and the polity. The thesis argues that conflicts are to some extent driven by international tension, or global, ideological and geo-political factors. Notwithstanding the global influence, local factors such as income inequality, income growth or lack of it, and political institutions, have an influence on conflicts. The thesis proposes a participatory conflict management procedure (CMP) that aspires to discover stable points for collaboration between confrontational parties. Stable points are mutual joint cooperative arrangements that diminish the probability of conflict re-escalation. The thesis presents a fundamental theoretical analysis for a new index of conflicts beta (b ) driven by international tension. In this section we show how to measure the extent to which local conflict in a country is driven by international tension/ global factors. We then offer an empirical foundation to the beta index by calculating the beta values for 92 nations for which we have data from 1970&#8211;2004. The thesis analyses the relationships between violent conflict and inequality. An econometric model is estimated using binary dependent variable techniques to capture the relation between violent conflict and inequality across Middle Eastern and Arab countries. It constructs two models based on the theoretical model and actual data: the first is a dummy variable that takes a value of one when a conflict has resulted over 1000 battle deaths in a given year and country. The second is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the conflict is completely internal, and another which is equal to one when the conflict involves an external actor.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social conflict</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">political violence</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">conflict management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and teaching in ESL : perspectives on educating international students in Australia</field><field name="creator">Glew, Paul J.</field><field name="description">This Doctor of Education (EdD) portfolio addresses the learning by and teaching of English to full-fee-paying international students from language backgrounds other than English in a secondary school setting in Australia. It focuses on the two strands of English second language (ESL) learning and teaching in schools. The first of these is ESL for the general school curriculum in New South Wales (NSW). The second is English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS). The EdD portfolio consists of two volumes. Volume 1 consists of five published journal papers, two refereed papers and one unrefereed paper published in national, state or local conference proceedings. These papers examine theory, pedagogy and teacher knowledge about English language education for high school aged international students. English language programs for overseas students are now a global market driven by commercial interests. I argue for an increased understanding of the needs of overseas students in the Australian education system, and that quality English language education and student welfare are both central to an effective ELICOS program for high school aged international students. Volume 2 comprises a resource for policy makers, principals and teachers entitled &#8216;Excellence in ELICOS: A Resource for quality preparation programs for high school aged international students in Australia&#8217;. Volume 2 is informed and underpinned by the scholarship, research, and theoretical work presented in Volume 1 but also draws on the author&#8217;s professional experience of implementing a holistic approach to international student welfare and English language education in a secondary school in NSW. Volume 2 presents a practical framework, approach and supporting resource that might assist in the establishing, implementing and sustaining of quality, intensive English language courses that are sensitive to the diverse educational and welfare needs of overseas students. Volume 2 was developed in response to the needs and demands of principals and teachers for proven, research driven curricula and policies that meet the needs of the growing population of international students enrolled in NSW secondary schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (secondary)</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mixed method study of violence against nurses in a rural and regional emergency department (ED)</field><field name="creator">Luck, Lauretta</field><field name="description">Internationally violence persists as a complex problem for nurses. While it is widely accepted that nursing staff in any health care setting can be the target of violence, in high acuity areas such as Emergency Departments (ED) nurses have an increased risk of violence. There is limited Australian research into violence experienced by nurses in the Australian Health sector, in particular the rural and regional Australian ED. Greater understanding of the phenomena of violence towards ED nurses, as it is manifest in the &#8216;real world&#8217; rural and regional Australian setting is needed to enable development of context specific solutions for this problem. This thesis presents a contextual, specialty nurses&#8217; assessment of violence risk, strategies for violence prediction and management, and the sequelae for the nurse. The aims of this study were to: Explore and describe the contextual assessment skills and preventative strategies rural and regional ED nurses use to understand and predict violent events, where the agent of violence is the patient, their family or friends, and understand the nature and scope of the sequelae of work place violent events from the nurse&#8217;s perspective. A mixed method instrumental case study was used to generate both qualitative and boundary for inquiry, and a structured process within which the chosen methods were able to define &#8216;the case&#8217; and answer the research question. This study was undertaken in 2005, at a regional Australian ED. Twenty (20) Registered Nurses were recruited into the study and consented to being observed. Textual qualitative data were generated from two hundred and ninety (290) hours of participant observation, sixteen (16) semi-structured interviews, thirteen (13) unstructured field interviews, and researcher journaling. In addition, sixteen (16) violent events were observed and recorded via a structured observation tool. Textual data were analysed thematically assisted by the qualitative data management and retrieval software NVivo2, and numeric data were analysed using frequency counts. The participants used their nursing knowledge(s), experience and context to assess their risk of violence. Embedded in the practice of these ED nurses was their ability to convey caring and respectfully approach all people presenting to ED. The participants&#8217; caring respectful demeanour underpinned their understanding of violence prevention strategies. Using this violence prevention approach, they attributed contextual meaning(s) to the violent event and agent of violence. The meaning(s) they attributed in turn shaped their response(s) to both the violent event and the agent of violence. A high level of observable collegial awareness supported and fostered their resilience towards the potentially negative affects of violence in the workplace. The five themes revealed by this study were; Conveying caring: Averting violence: Being alert: Recognising, assessing and responding to violence: Attributing meaning: Subjective understandings that shape responses to Violence : Collegial awareness: Forming trusting relationships to help manage violence: Fostering resilience: resisting the negative sequelae of violence. Violence was interpreted by these ED nurses in a more systematic and complex way than the current definitions make possible. Violence assessment, prevention and management skills were embodied in the participant ED nurses&#8217; routine practice and their conceptualisation of caring. The meanings given to violence were contextually constructed and these ascribed meaning(s) and judgments informed the actions that the nurses took in response to both the violent event and the agent of violence.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">violence against</field><field name="subject">violence in the workplace</field><field name="subject">emergency nursing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbian language, memory, and the social construction of inclusion</field><field name="creator">Kleinert, Veronica</field><field name="description">Lesbian language can be defined as a codified (Queen 1997) and/or an indexible and discursive body of knowledge (Morrish and Sauntson 2007). A large proportion of research has been conducted on the heterosexual-homosexual binary and the construction of the social relations that constitute normalcy and its discursive opposite, abnormalcy, and the various codifications that exemplify these locations. The objective of this present research is to locate the social construction of inclusion within lesbian language using the empirical research technique of memory work (Haug 1987). The data were obtained from a longitudinal group process involving six respondents identifying as lesbian. The results consist of the analysis of discursive patterns produced by the group using written narratives and discussions ensuing from the reading of the narratives. Memory work is the methodology used to obtain the data and is supported by a broad theoretical framework comprising ethnographic sociolinguistics (Berger and Luckmann 1966; Bourdieu 1980; Rampton et al 2006), critical discourse analysis (Halliday 1994), queer theory (Butler 1990-1997) as well as the newly evolving post-queer theories (Seidman 1997; McLaughlin 2003). My focus is on the richer patterns of discursive content that denote the production of textual lesbian-specific inclusion. The results were contextualised as negotiations of inclusion through the process of self-construction within the dichotomous social locations constituting society, specifically those that surround the concept of reality fantasy - and the accumulations of knowledge realised as inclusiveness. Through these three discrete modes of discursive and cultural expression as bodies of research, the memory work group participants demonstrated their discursive and cultural self construction and subsequent inclusion in lesbian language.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">sex differences</field><field name="subject">sociolinguists</field><field name="subject">memory work</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who really matters : a mixed methods investigation into interoccupational  and professional dynamics when managing  patient flow</field><field name="creator">Eljiz, Kathy</field><field name="description">This study explores how formal and informal social networks and decision making about resources in the hospital setting are related. Over the last few years, tensions between new public management of hospitals and increased demands has led to an increase in bottlenecks, stagnation of patient flow, and overcrowded emergency departments. These problems have led to an increase in access block for patients attempting to access the public hospital system. The introduction of Patient Flow Units has instigated the formalisation of a nurse manager function to coordinate patient flow. Nurses in such a pivotal position and who greatly influence hospital operations, tend to have special characteristics and use these to &#8220;get things done&#8221;. This thesis investigates interpersonal associations between professional (e.g. doctors and nurses) and functional groups (e.g. clinicians and managers), when making clinical and operational decisions when transferring a patient from the emergency department to a ward bed. By employing a mixed methodology, this thesis first sought to establish a snapshot of organisational culture in three hospitals. Drawing on Degeling et al. (1998) and Fitzgerald (2002), an organisational cultural survey was distributed to a total of 1750 participants. The response rate was 11.65% This survey particularly addressed five cultural constructs including a sense of organisational commitment, perceptions of managerial role characteristics, perceptions of currently pursued organisational goals, perceptions of orientation to work values when choosing a job, and interactions with various professional constituencies. In addition, 18 interviews were conducted and a total of 150 hours of observation of work processes, interactions between staff and environmental conditions were studied. This investigation largely confirmed earlier studies by Degeling (2002) and Fitzgerald (2002) that professional groups believed that their organisation primarily exhibited an Elite style of management, that financial viability is the most important goal their organisation is pursuing, and staff welfare was a low priority. In addition, it found significant differences in cultural footprints between the small hospital, which had a more integrated culture, and the large hospital, which was more fragmented in nature. However, the major contribution of this investigation is demonstrated in the qualitative chapter. This thesis found that the role of &#8220;who matters the most&#8221; in relation to decision making about patient flow, changes depending on the stage of the decision making process. It also found that non-managerial nursing staff with no formal power or legitimacy could affect urgency. The thesis comprises eight chapters. Following the introductory chapter, Chapter 2 considers the literature associated with the public health system in Australia with a focus on public hospitals in NSW. Chapter 3 critically examines the literature describing organisational culture, with an emphasis on subcultures. Chapter 4 contains a review of professional identity and roles, networks and alliances, social capital, deep smarts, and stakeholder theory. Description and justification of the research method selected to explore the thesis proposition follows in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 contains an outline of the findings concerning the analysis of the survey questionnaire to determine a cultural footprint of the three hospitals studied. Chapter 7 considers the different roles of professional groups (doctors, nurses, and others) and functional groups (clinicians and managers) in the operational phase of patient flow and in doing so contributes to knowledge. Finally, in Chapter 8, a discussion summarises the thesis findings, describes the implications, acknowledges limitations of the study and identifies avenues for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health administration</field><field name="subject">health services administration</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">medical personnel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community management in the quasi-market : a critical examination of changes in discourse and practice in community organisations in New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">O'Shea, Peri</field><field name="description">The institutionalisation of neo-liberalist discourse has significantly changed the way in which the relationship between government and community organisations is described and regulated in Australia. These changes are most clearly articulated in government policy discourse as a move away from &#8216;funding&#8217; community service organisations, to &#8216;purchasing&#8217; the delivery of services. Under previous funding models, responsiveness to community need was emphasised. Local knowledge was valued and community organisations were largely viewed as best positioned to assess local needs and to design services to the meet those needs. In contrast, new highly regulated funding models have created a change in discourse that positions the community organisation as a seller of services to the government. In the &#8216;quasi-market&#8217; the government is usually the only (or main) purchaser of services. As the sole purchaser, the government is now (potentially) responsible for specifying the nature of services that they are prepared to purchase. These changes in positioning have been accompanied by significant devolution of previous government provision of human services to the non-profit sector, and are supplemented by considerable changes in regulation practices. The principal questions asked in this research are: How have the changes in discourse and practice at the government level influenced existing discourse and practices in community organisations?  How have changes in discourse and practices within and among community organisations affected their capability to operate in a way that is consistent with the values inherent in community discourse? This research approaches the research questions from a Social Constructionist epistemology informed by the work of Michel Foucault and also neo-institutional theorists. This research implements Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as the methodological framework to draw out and analyse tensions that arise from a contest of the discourses of &#8216;community&#8217; and &#8216;managerialism&#8217;. This research critically examines emergent structures and practices of community organisations in New South Wales (NSW) through the critical analysis of relevant texts and data from four focus groups and nineteen interviews of management committee members and coordinators from community organisations throughout NSW Australia, with a focus on Greater Western Sydney. The way in which these changes at the government level have been translated in discourse and practice at the organisational level, has resulted in a number of tensions within and among community organisations. The major tensions that emerged, and are discussed and analysed in this research, were: Increased managerialism and the impact on &#8216;traditional&#8217; beliefs &#8211; or the &#8216;institutional myths&#8217; &#8211; of community discourse and practice. Increased reliance by governments on community organisations and the effects of this on organisational capacity: A shift of emphasis in accountabilities coupled with increased &#8216;professionalisation&#8217; and the impact on &#8216;community representation&#8217;. Need or desire for alliances among community organisations and the impact of this on diversity and individual responsiveness. With these tensions came significant frustration and hardship as traditional strategies became more difficult to action in the quasi-market. Much of this tension was due to the use of one discourse to interpret another. What is required in community organisations is an increase in &#8216;critical consciousness&#8217; to develop a &#8216;cultural literacy&#8217;. This study identified a number of strategies that were assisting community organisations to re-define their position in the new discursive context.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community organization</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">non-governmental organizations</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">critical discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Companion animal veterinary services in Australia : environment, marketing practices and performance</field><field name="creator">Baguley, John</field><field name="description">The marketing of professional services is a relatively recent discipline driven by a changing political and social environment. The services marketing literature has evolved within this changing environment from an initial focus upon the distinction between products and services; to the importance of quality, relationships, interfunctional coordination and processes; and most recently to the contemporary marketing practices framework and the service dominant logic. In this thesis, secondary data were analysed to understand trends within the major forces affecting the attractiveness of the companion animal veterinary services industry in Australia. Case studies complemented this analysis by describing individual organisations operating within local environments, their marketing practices and performance. A survey of the industry was subsequently administered and analysed to describe the relative importance of industry forces upon incumbents, the range of contemporary marketing practices adopted, and to test relationships between environment, marketing practices and marketing performance. Whilst secondary data revealed that pet ownership and household demographic trends were leading to stabilisation of the number of potential buyers for companion animal veterinary services at a national level, this research has found that changing attitudes towards pets, pet care and the human animal bond, together with advances in technology and individual veterinary hospital marketing practices, had generally resulted in a positive impact on veterinary revenue within the last 10 years. For individual veterinary hospitals competing within this industry, external environmental and industry structural forces were of varying importance and both functional and process approaches to marketing were evident within the industry. Specifically with respect to the contemporary marketing practices framework, companion animal veterinary hospitals in Australia mostly related to their markets through interaction marketing but also employed transaction, database and network marketing practices. Network marketing practices were found to be effective for acquiring clients and interaction marketing practices were effective in driving revenue growth. This research has provided potential contributions to extant literature in the areas of industry analysis, services marketing and more specifically within the discipline of veterinary business management. Firstly, the framework combining external forces (political, economic, social, technological and natural) with industry structural forces analysis was an effective method for analysing the marketing environment affecting the companion animal veterinary services industry in Australia. Secondly, industry attractiveness was significantly related to industry profitability and transaction marketing practices were associated with less attractive environments. Thirdly, whilst secondary data defined the industry as mature, marketing practices adopted by industry incumbents have resulted in significant revenue growth in recent years. Finally, whilst the marketing literature has emphasised the distinction between transactional and relational perspectives, this research has highlighted the possibility of considering a functional and process approach to the marketing of professional services. Linked to this latter finding, this research has highlighted the value of the contemporary marketing practices framework for understanding the marketing of professional, high-involvement services, and integrating theoretical and empirical perspectives in marketing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">veterinary services</field><field name="subject">pets</field><field name="subject">services for</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/41997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of spectral tilt on infants' speech perception : implications for infants with hearing loss</field><field name="creator">Beach, Elizabeth F.</field><field name="description">Infants with hearing loss (HL) are being diagnosed and fitted with amplification earlier than ever before. In order to acquire speech and language abilities that are on par with their normal-hearing (NH) peers, hearing-impaired (HI) infants require amplification that provides appropriate exposure to the sounds of their native language. To date, no research has addressed this issue and thus, there is a need to examine the type of amplification that is most suitable for infants during the early stages of language acquisition. In this thesis, three different amplification types were compared: one that preserves the natural spectral shape of speech (unmodified speech); a second that emphasises high-frequency speech information (positive spectral tilt); and a third that emphasises low-frequency information (negative spectral tilt). NH infants were tested to examine how each of these amplification types affects speech perception and to explore whether infants at different stages of language acquisition find modified spectral tilt a help or hindrance in perceiving native-language speech contrasts. A visual habituation (VH) procedure was used to test 288 6- and 9-month-old NH infants on their ability to discriminate the high-frequency fricative contrast /f/- /s/; the mid-frequency approximant contrast /l/-/r/; and the low-frequency vowel contrast /5/-/N/ under modified spectral tilt conditions. For each speech contrast, 96 infants were tested in one of three conditions: (a) unmodified spectral tilt (n = 32); (b) with a positive 6 dB/octave spectral tilt (n = 32); or (c) with a negative 6 dB/octave spectral tilt (n = 32). The results showed that both 6- and 9-month-olds discriminated the three speech contrasts in the unmodified condition. However, when the contrasts were spectrally modified, a consistent developmental trend emerged. Six-month-olds&#8217; discrimination performance improved when the spectral tilt modification amplified the relevant frequency information. That is, for the consonant contrasts (fricatives /f/-/s/ and approximants /l/-/r/) 6-month-olds performed best when high-frequency information was emphasised, whereas for the vowel contrast (/5/-/N/) the best discrimination performance was found when low-frequency information was enhanced. Nine-month-olds, on the other hand, showed no evidence of discriminating any of the contrasts when spectral tilt was modified. For all three contrasts, the older infants&#8217; best discrimination performance was in the unmodified spectral tilt condition. The findings reflect the early stages of linguistic development. Six-month olds, whose acoustically driven speech perception operates in a language-general mode, demonstrated a broad-based ability to discriminate speech sounds. They not only accommodated speech with positive or negative spectral tilt, but a facilitation effect was observed when relevant frequency information was amplified. In contrast, 9-month-olds, whose perception is linguistically driven, found that spectral tilt modifications hinder speech perception. It seems that because older infants are attuning to native phonemic categories, their attention is constrained to native language spectral profiles only. Thus, even those spectral tilt modifications that should have been beneficial for perception were eschewed by 9-month-olds because they were incompatible with the older infants&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; narrow focus on spectrally intact native speech sounds. Only NH infants were tested in this study, so it is not possible draw firm conclusions about amplification schemes until HI infants are tested too. Nevertheless, the results have a number of implications for infants with HL. The demonstration that spectral tilt modifications interfere with older NH infants&#8217; speech perception suggests that future research should investigate whether HI infants also show this developmental pattern. That is, do HI infants progressively attune to the native language, and if so, does this affect their perception of spectrally modified speech sounds? Moreover, if HI infants are to attune to the native language and acquire speech and language in the same way as their NH peers, then the research reported here suggests that, throughout infancy, HI infants will need access to amplified speech that maintains the spectral shape of natural speech. Thus, the current research demonstrates, for the first time, a developmental difference in the way that infants perceive spectrally modified speech, one that is closely linked to the infant&#8217;s stage of native-language attunement. This research provides a solid foundation on which to conduct further research with HI infants and offers preliminary suggestions with regard to amplification and intervention to ensure that HI infants have the opportunity to emulate the native-language attunement process and subsequently achieve language development outcomes comparable with their NH peers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech perception in infants</field><field name="subject">hearing disorders in infants</field><field name="subject">hearing aids</field><field name="subject">spectral analysis (phonetics)</field><field name="subject">language acquisition</field><field name="subject">infants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career management in the NSW Public Service : the experience of  secondary school careers advisers</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Ron</field><field name="description">This research sets out to identify (i) the perceptions of careers advisers and other relevant stakeholders about current career management practices provided for secondary school careers advisers by the NSWDET and (ii) the current and future career issues faced by NSWDET careers advisers in view of social political and economic changes in the last decade in so far as they impact upon their careers. In this thesis, career management is conceptualised as a process which involves employees becoming aware of their own interests, values, strengths and weaknesses, obtaining information about job opportunities within their organisation (and by implication, with other potential employers), identifying career goals and creating plans to achieve such goals. As such, the process is not exclusively driven by the employer, but is rather a joint responsibility. However to discover what the career management stakeholders viewed about the career management received by NSWDET secondary careers advisers, it was necessary to focus on what this employer had provided. To establish a set of criteria to discover the types and support for such career management, the schema of career management interventions provided by Arnold&#8217;s (1997) see Table 1.1, was used as an investigative tool. The conclusions reached are that there remain unmet challenges for the career management of secondary school careers advisers and indeed to the careers of these practitioners in NSWDET schools. An important outcome of this thesis will be to create a set of recommendations to guide the future course of managing the careers of these secondary school careers advisers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">career advisers</field><field name="subject">training of</field><field name="subject">vocational guidance</field><field name="subject">career development</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How role play addresses the difficulties students perceive when writing reflectively about the concepts they are learning in science</field><field name="creator">Millar, Susan</field><field name="description">A fundamental problem which confronts Science teachers is the difficulty many students experience in the construction, understanding and remembering of concepts. This is more likely to occur when teachers adhere to a Transmission model of teaching and learning, and fail to provide students with opportunities to construct their own learning. Social construction, followed by individual reflective writing, enables students to construct their own understanding of concepts and effectively promotes deep learning. This method of constructing knowledge in the classroom is often overlooked by teachers as they either have no knowledge of it, or do not know how to appropriate it for successful teaching in Science. This study identifies the difficulties which students often experience when writing reflectively and offers solutions which are likely to reduce these difficulties. These solutions, and the use of reflective writing itself, challenge the ideology of the Sydney Genre School, which forms the basis of the attempt to deal with literacy in the NSW Science Syllabus. The findings of this investigation support the concept of literacy as the ability to use oral and written language, reading and listening to construct meaning. The investigation demonstrates how structured discussion, role play and reflective writing can be used to this end. While the Sydney Genre School methodology focuses on the structure of genre as a prerequisite for understanding concepts in Science, the findings of this study demonstrate that students can use their own words to discuss and write reflectively as they construct scientific concepts for themselves. Social construction and reflective writing can contribute to the construction of concepts and the development of metacognition in Science. However, students often experience difficulties when writing reflectively about scientific concepts they are learning. In this investigation, students identified these difficulties as an inability to understand, remember and think about a concept and to plan the sequence of their reflective writing. This study was undertaken in four different classes at junior to senior levels. The difficulties identified by students were successfully addressed by role play and the activities that are integral to it. These include physical or kinaesthetic activity, social construction, the use of drawing, diagrams and text, and the provision of a concrete model of the concept. Through the enactment effect, kinaesthetic activity enables students to automatically remember and visualise concepts, whilst visual stimuli and social construction provide opportunities for students to both visualise and verbalise concepts. In addition, the provision of a concrete model enables most students to visualise and understand abstract concepts to some extent. These activities, embedded in role play, enable students to understand, remember, sequence and think about a concept as they engage in reflective writing. This, in turn, enhances understanding and memory. Role play has hitherto been regarded as a useful teaching technique when dealing with very young students. This study demonstrates that role play can be highly effective when teaching Science at the secondary level. This investigation looks at the activities embedded in role play, and demonstrates how they can be effectively translated from theoretical constructs into classroom practice. Grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Glaser, 1978; 1998; 2002) was selected as the most appropriate methodology for this investigation. The problems of identifying and controlling variables in an educational setting were essentially resolved using this qualitative, interpretative approach. Students from four classes in Years 8, 10 and 11 were investigated. Data were gathered using classroom observations, informal interviews, and formal written interviews, focus group conversations and samples of student writing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (secondary)</field><field name="subject">technical writing</field><field name="subject">communication in science</field><field name="subject">cognitive learning</field><field name="subject">role playing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The knowing body : meaning and method in Yat Malmgren's actor training technique</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Janys</field><field name="description">Little has been written of Yat Malmgren&#8217;s actor training technique, despite its international influence in mainstream western actor training. Created originally for the construction and performance of characters in theatrical and screen realism, at the Drama Centre, London, in the 1960-1970s, Malmgren&#8217;s actor training process, known as Character Analysis, forms a body of knowledge, which is transmitted practically and experientially to trainee actors. This thesis outlines the Malmgren technique&#8217;s traditions, processes of transmission and centres primarily on the modes of understanding that underlie this practical system. This research sets a series of widening contextualistations of understandings of the modalities of embedded/embodied knowledge disseminated through the training process. Interwoven throughout this thesis, the researcher&#8217;s voice appears as a Researcher&#8217;s Journal, placing the embodied awareness of the researcher, as one of the principal Malmgren trainers in Australia. The material and engendered locus for this research is my own embodied consciousness. This research differentiates Malmgren&#8217;s training process both from Laban&#8217;s movement techniques and from other twentieth century western actor training processes. It begins with the traditions of Rudolf Laban&#8217;s movement theories, from which the Malmgren technique arose, Hermeneutic phenomenology is the methodological framework used to investigate the meaning of the Malmgren technique to those studying it, taking into account contemporary performance and communication theories of agency and embodiment. Benner&#8217;s (1994) hermeneutic phenomenological method of data collection and analysis, used previously in nursing research, is newly applied to the field of acting. Participants from three full-time acting courses, where Yat Malmgren&#8217;s technique is the principal mode of actor training, provide the interview data to articulate a series of phenomenological themes. This research uses Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#8217;s image of the chiasm, where materiality and consciousness interweave as an underlying metaphorical structure for embodiment. This research proposes a six-step progression, through which Malmgren&#8217;s technique enables trainee actors to develop a growing performative awareness of their bodily-located behaviours. This research also posits the generation of heightened differentiation of sensory inputs and expressions for trainee actors through the Malmgren technique, and how this opens up possibilities for transformation in modes of embodiment for the trainee. Using feminist theories, this research links this development of embodied awareness, in particular the awareness of non-verbal communication and the &#8216;unspoken&#8217;, with a greater understanding of alterity. Whilst the Malmgren technique was developed for purposes of theatrical realism, this research indicates that the technique&#8217;s impact facilitates a range of modes of performance by investigating the less articulated forms of performative communication.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malmgren, Yat, 1916-2002</field><field name="subject">acting</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">psychology of</field><field name="subject">nonverbal communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boundaries of the soul : the mythic imagination, place and shamanic consciousness in literary form</field><field name="creator">Hartley, William</field><field name="description">In the Western cultural tradition there is a particular aspect of consciousness discernable in certain fictive literature; mythopoeic literary consciousness (MLC), the evolution of which may be traced back to its earliest manifestation in the cave paintings of the Upper Palaeolithic period in Europe. Researchers agree that those cave paintings are indicative of shamanic activity, which suggests an interesting relationship between shamanic consciousness and MLC. This research investigates contemporary experiences of this relationship in the context of place and the Imaginal Realm using a combination of empirical and textual methods. The evolution of the narrative psyche is described; beginning with recent interpretations of the aetiology and meaning of the European Upper Palaeolithic cave paintings. Shamanism is then examined and linkages are made with subsequent esoteric traditions such as Gnosticism, Hermeticism, the Imaginal Realm of the Sufi mystics, and the Romantic Movement in European literature. The Imaginal Realm, as a metaphysical construct, is posited in relationship to de Chardin&#8217;s Noosphere, Sheldrake&#8217;s Morphic Resonance, the Celtic Web of Wyrd and Jung&#8217;s Collective Unconscious. Empirical research is presented on contemporary expressions of this tradition. Three internationally recognised Australian authors, David Malouf, Thomas Keneally and Colleen McCullough, were either interviewed or completed a questionnaire on their backgrounds, the role of place relationships, states of consciousness when writing and reading, the role of literature and related questions. Five dedicated readers and two professionally credentialed practicing shamans completed similar questionnaires on their experiences and views on literature, the act of reading, and shamanic and creative consciousness. The responses are accompanied by textual analysis of the work of the three authors, drawing out themes of importance. Further discussion of the empirical and textual material in the context of broader literature establishes the epistemological dimensions of both mythopoeic literary consciousness and shamanic consciousness. The nature and relationship of consciousness and soul are examined from a perspective that unites them with the anima mundi and posits them in relationship with place and elsewhere-place. The concluding section revisits core themes to posit the mythopoeic writer and MLC within the heritage of a metaphysical tradition that delineates the existential boundaries of the psyche. It is argued that MLC is a manifestation of the narrative imperative of the psyche or soul to orientate itself along a place-elsewhere-place continuum, a continuum that parallels states of consciousness from the participation mystique to the de-centred self.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mythopoeic writers</field><field name="subject">mythopoeia</field><field name="subject">myth in literature</field><field name="subject">fantastic literature, English</field><field name="subject">history and criticism</field><field name="subject">art, shamanistic</field><field name="subject">shamanism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainfall energy loss model in soil erosion process</field><field name="creator">Pudasaini, Madhu S.</field><field name="description">Soil erosion is recognized as a global threat against the sustainability of the natural ecosystem and the environment because of its severe effects in agricultural productivity, damage to infrastructure and pollution of water bodies. Adverse impacts due to human activities resulting in accelerated soil erosion process have been well documented. Much more attention has been given to study the mechanisms associated with the process of soil erosion in the second half of the 20th century. Different mathematical models have been developed to simulate soil erosion processes and incorporate the result in different options of erosion controls. Modelling soil erosion is a complex process that involves numerous parameters. It is for this reason that even highly sophisticated and advanced erosion prediction models like Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) do not incorporate all mechanisms of the soil erosion process. An obvious gap is the satisfactory explanation and incorporation of soil erosion mechanism associated with the initial portion of microchannels where both inter-rill and rill erosion exist. This study attempts to fill this gap through extension of knowledge in the area of soil erosion mechanism, specifically within the initial portions of rill where both splash erosion and erosion due to shear stress exist. Detachment of soil particles from the soil surface depends on the kinetic energy imparted by raindrops. Therefore, it is essential to estimate kinetic energy as accurately as possible to enable study of soil erosion and infiltration mechanisms. Rainfall simulation is widely used to generate rainfall of desired intensities and durations to study soil erosion, infiltration and other dynamic behaviours of soil. Kinetic energy of a rainfall event is often estimated from its intensity. The actual kinetic energy imparted on a soil surface is generally less than the total value of kinetic energy of a rainfall event. This is because of the cushioning effect of the overland flow. Therefore, there is a potential risk of over prediction of splash erosion by an erosion prediction model that does not account for this cushioning effect. In this study, experiments were carried out to estimate the kinetic energy of three different simulated rainfall events produced by three different combinations of pressures and nozzle sizes. The equipment consisted of a multipurpose hydraulic flume, 2m long and 1.4m wide. Five highly sensitive force transducers were mounted on the surface of the flume to measure the impact of raindrops. Different slopes were represented in the experiment by tilting the flume in four different angles from 0 to 15 degrees. Two tipping bucket rain gauges were used to measure rainfall intensity. The nozzles were placed at a height sufficient to produce terminal velocity by the falling rain drops before they hit the flume surface. Overland flow was generated by continuously supplying water to the inlet tank constructed at the upstream of the hydraulic flume. Responses received from the transducers (in the form of voltage) and from the tipping bucket (in the form of pulses) were recorded at regular intervals. Based on this experimental study, a logarithmic energy loss model that accounts for the depth of shallow overland flow, rainfall intensity and bed slope to estimate potential loss of kinetic energy is proposed. Analysis of the results from the study indicated a significant reduction in kinetic energy when the surface flow starts to build up. The analysis also indicated that a significant portion of the energy is lost even though the flow depth is small. This implies that while splash erosion initially contributes to the total amount of soil erosion, most of the erosion after the initial phase is due to the flow induced shear stress. Another important conclusion of this study is that steeper the slope, the lesser the expected overland flow depth and hence more potential for splash erosion and sheet erosion. The Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency statistic of 90% obtained from this study signifies that the model could be used as a useful predictive tool to estimate rainfall kinetic energy loss. The energy loss model developed as a result of this study can be incorporated in process-based soil erosion models to accurately estimate splash erosion and improve the predictive power of these models. In Addition, the model can be used to estimate the critical depth of overland flow when the kinetic energy approaching the soil surface is practically nil. This critical depth can be used to define the transition zone and explicitly define the term &#8220;Rill&#8221;. The multipurpose hydraulic flume designed and developed for this study can be used for further studies in area of hydraulic and soil erosion research. The methodology developed in this research will be helpful in carrying out further experiments and improve the			proposed energy loss model. The potential Future improvements to the model include the followings: i) incorporating the effect of sediment concentration, ii) using wider ranges of intensities, and iii) using an actual soil bed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil erosion</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="subject">rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">rainfall simulators</field><field name="subject">energy dissipation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of national employment in public and private sectors in the the state of Kuwait</field><field name="creator">Al-Rashidi, Hamed Ali H.</field><field name="description">Kuwait is a small, developing oil-producing country with a total population of approximately 2.6 million. Kuwaiti citizens represent approximately 40% of the total population. Less than 20% of the total labour force are Kuwaiti citizens. The government sector acts as the main provider of jobs for Kuwaiti citizens. Approximately three-quarters of Kuwaiti citizens are employed in the public sector, whereas non-Kuwaitis represent over 90% of the private sector labour force. The aim of this thesis is to assess the factors determining demand for and supply of national labour in the State of Kuwait. A number of surveys are conducted to collect information on issues relating to the views of employers and employees regarding various aspects of the labour market. The results of the surveys are analysed using multivariate statistical techniques. The sample results of this thesis suggest that approximately 80 percent of Kuwaiti male workers and 96 percent of Kuwaiti female workers are employed in the Government sector, while approximately 11 percent of Kuwaiti males and less than three percent of Kuwaiti females are employed in the private sector. Approximately nine percent of Kuwaiti males and two percent of Kuwaiti females work in the mixed government-private sector. The majority of Kuwaiti citizens seem to be employed as professionals, clerks and services. Twenty percent of Kuwaiti males and 49 percent of Kuwaiti females are professionals, while 51 percent of both Kuwaiti males and Kuwaiti females work as clerks. Many researchers have devoted their time and skill to analysing factors affecting the demand for supply of labour, the impact of wage differentials on employment, the role of government in offering employment and how to minimize the percentage of unemployment. Only a few researchers have given their attention to labour force issues in Middle Eastern countries. This thesis attempts to close some of the existing gaps in the literature on the Kuwaiti economy. In particular, it examines the distribution of manpower in the state of Kuwait; analyses the structure of employment of Kuwaiti citizens; evaluates the main motives of Kuwaiti citizens in searching for jobs in the public sector; and examines the reasons why firms operating in the private sector prefer to employ expatriates rather than Kuwaiti citizens. It also models decisions by Kuwaiti female citizens to participate in the labour force and decision as to whether an unemployed Kuwaiti will join the  market conditions for Kuwaiti citizens over the next five years. In order to achieve these objectives, this thesis conducted surveys based on random samples, related to Kuwaiti labour force, Kuwaiti females and private companies. Multivariate statistical techniques such as discriminant analysis, factor analysis, probit-logit regression analysis and multiple regression analysis are applied to collected data. The results of factor analysis, using the principal component method and varimax rotation, reduce the large number of variables that motivate Kuwaiti citizens to prefer employment in the Government Sector to four factors: job suitability, job prospects and convenience, job security and, most importantly, the level of wages offered by the Government compared to that offered by the private sector. The canonical discriminant functions evaluated at group means (group centroid) suggest that small firms who do not employ nationals are concerned mainly about the wage levels these employees wish to receive. These firms believe that nationals ask for much higher wages than expatriates. Medium-sized employers are not eager to employ nationals for fear that they will not be satisfied with the offered positions and may not stay in employment for long periods. Large employers who elect to employ expatriates rather than nationals do so because they believe that nationals do not possess the necessary qualifications and experience for the positions they wish to occupy.			Discriminant analysis of survey results suggest that the probability that a Kuwaiti woman will join the labour force grows the higher the wage rate, the more educated the woman, the more suitable jobs are available and the easier it is to get domestic help. Participation of Kuwaiti women in the labour force is negatively related to marital status, family income and number of children under the age of six. The prevailing wage rate is the most influential factor affecting Kuwaiti women participation in the labour force, whether they are married or unmarried. The second most important factor influencing Kuwaiti women&#8217;s decision to participate in the labour force is education. While age seems to be the third most important factor that positively influences Kuwaiti unmarried women&#8217;s decision to participate in the labour force, the age factor does not seem to be as significant for married women. Availability of suitable jobs is the third most significant factor in positively influencing Kuwaiti married women to participate in the labour force. This factor does not seem to exert such a great influence on unmarried women. Many Kuwaiti women, particularly if married, indicate that they would prefer to work part-time (i.e. for some part of the day or for only a few days a week) or engage in home-based employment (e.g. caring for others&#8217; young children, tailoring, manufacturing simple products, selling over the phone or internet). The family income has a much higher (negative) effect on the participation rate for married than unmarried Kuwaiti women. Married women are less likely to participate in the labour force if they have children of preschool age. Both the logit and probit regression models gave a good fit. The econometric results suggest that the longer the Kuwaiti citizen is unemployed, the higher the probability that he or she will accept employment in the private sector. On the other hand, the higher the level of education or the average family income, the lower the probability that a person will look for jobs in the private sector. Age does not seem to have any significant impact on the decision to accept employment in the private sector. There is no clear distinction in the attitudes of unemployed Kuwaiti citizens of different ages towards accepting jobs in the Government or the private sector. Sex is a significant factor, however: Kuwaiti females are reluctant to work in the private sector, and the probability that unemployed female Kuwaiti citizens will join the private sector is lower than the probability that a male Kuwaiti unemployed citizen will do so. Unemployed Kuwaiti citizens who enjoy a relatively high family income are more likely to search for jobs in the Government sector where current terms and conditions of employment are much more lucrative, and are prepared to wait for lengthy periods until offered employment in the Government sector.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">labor supply</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">Kuwait</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital culture, copyright maximalism, and the challenge to copyright law</field><field name="creator">Spender, Lynne</field><field name="description">The rapid diffusion of digital technologies since the 1970s has produced significant cultural change within industrialised societies and this dissertation examines the particular challenge that digital technologies and a burgeoning digital culture pose to copyright law. The hypothesis is that the international copyright regime, based on the private ownership of intellectual property, is being undermined by the collaborative and sharing dimensions of a networked digital culture. The argument is premised on evidence that digital culture is now so pervasive and so disruptive of traditional social and economic institutions that current copyright laws are no longer capable of managing the production and distribution of the knowledge, information and entertainment products that are fundamental to the operation of the global information economy. Ideological and cultural differences have led to conflict and &#8216;copyfights&#8217; between the owners of copyright works and the digital creators who produce and share copyright works outside the commercial marketplace, and often, outside the law. Defending their legal rights, the owners have generally adopted a copyright maximalist approach. They have successfully argued for stricter laws to protect their valuable private property rights and have enforced the law against digital pirates and new technologies that they claim threaten their businesses and the orderly operation of the knowledge economy. The digital sharers have adopted a &#8216;copyleft&#8217; approach. Demonstrating little respect for laws that inhibit digital creativity and innovation, and supportive of a public domain of accessible cultural works, they argue for less stringent legal controls over copyright works and for a new intellectual commons in which knowledge, information and entertainment products are shared, rather than privately owned. Analysis of the culture clash between owners and sharers and between their private and public interests demonstrates that the 21st century copyfights are divisive and expensive. This dissertation, as well as addressing the challenge that digital culture poses to copyright law, suggests possibilities for legal reform and opens up new terrain for further study into the question of who should own and benefit from the knowledge and information that form our cultural heritage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">piracy</field><field name="subject">fair use</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">digital media</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">computers and civilization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of L2 vocabulary expansion in the perception and production of Australian English vowels by adult native speakers of Japanese</field><field name="creator">Bundgaard-Nielsen, Rikke L.</field><field name="description">Research indicates that adult Second Language (L2) learners typically do not become native-like in their perception or production of their L2, likely as a result of interference from their native language (L1). Research also indicates that L2 perception and production nonetheless improves with increased experience with the L2. Until recently, however, theories of L2 acquisition (e.g., SLM: Flege, 1995; PAM: Best, 1994) have been vague in their account of the processes underlying this improvement. The recent PAM-L2 (Best and Tyler, 2007), however, opens up new ways to understand experiential change in L2 perception and production. Centrally, PAM-L2 suggests that a large L2 vocabulary curtails change in L2 perception and production because it forces the learner to settle on an accented version of the L2 phonology. The present thesis introduces the Vocabulary-Tuning Model of L2 Rephonologisation (Vocab Model). This model extends PAM-L2 by highlighting the facilitating effect of L2 vocabulary expansion, in early L2 immersion when the L2 vocabulary is still small, on the perception and production of an L2. It is further argued that the processes underpinning this improvement are analogous to those that underpin L1 acquisition in infants and toddlers. The thesis tests the Vocab Model in a series of studies (cross-sectional as well as longitudinal) of the perception and production of Australian English vowels by native speakers of Japanese, who have recently arrived in Australia for the purpose of acquiring English. The results show that L2 vocabulary size is indeed associated with L2 vowel perception and production and thus support the predictions of the Vocab Model. The thesis examines the usefulness of different criteria for L2-L1 vowel assimilation and discusses the findings in relation to results from L1-vowel perception research. The research design also pioneers a &#8216;whole system&#8217; approach to cross-language vowel perception research that allows the learners to use all native vowels and all native vowel combinations (all three thesis studies), and to apply them to the full inventory of L2 vowels (Study 1). It is argued that results from such an approach more appropriately reflect the actual perceptual flexibility of the learners in a natural L2-immersion context than would a smaller subset of L1 and/or L2 vowels. This &#8216;whole system&#8217; approach further suggests that L1 phonotactics is worthwhile to consider in future studies of L2 segmental perception and production.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">dialects</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">phonetics</field><field name="subject">vowels</field><field name="subject">vocabulary</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Japanese speakers</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the retention of first year students</field><field name="creator">Bishop, Graham</field><field name="description">The thesis compares student attrition rates in two UWS Schools for 2004 and 2005. It analyses possible reasons why students discontinue and identifies strategies and approaches to improving the quality of the teaching and learning environment for these students. The thesis focuses on the retention of first year students in the School of Engineering at the University of Western Sydney. Low retention rates are costly to the university, leading to inefficient use of resources, failure to fulfil student aspirations, and intervention between the university and the student. In each chapter, the thesis addresses student retention, satisfaction and performance and the interrelation between them and outlines the measures taken by the School of Engineering to improve these measurements for students commencing in 2006 and proposes many recommendations for further improvements in subsequent years. Each chapter addresses these issues by following the student pathway, commencing with the student leaving High School and entering their chosen university and course of study. At each stage, the relevant issues are addressed which have a direct or indirect impact on student retention, satisfaction and performance. Use is made of reports and papers published by universities and organisations, as outlined in the Literature Review. The research questions provide data through the results obtained from surveys. Typical Retention Rates are 75% for UWS, 81% for the Sector, 76% for the New Generation Universities (NGUs) and 62% for the School of Engineering on which this research is focussed. This thesis confirms the research from many countries that closely links student retention with the quality of teaching and learning. Key issues are: &#8226; a sound first year student orientation and welcome by staff; encountering efficient, effective and accurate student. The introduction of a more effective and tailored orientation program in 2007 attracted, at UWS School of Engineering, 92% attendance and greater awareness by the students of their study program and the available support services; &#8226; having student queries responded to promptly and effectively; The introduction of a First Year Coordinator in 2007 proved to be well received, with a significant number of students having prompt responses to their queries, as compared with previous years; clear expectations management about services and key academic issues like assessment; the marketing of UWS Engineering programs was addressed in 2006 and 2007, with an expansion of the marketing program operated for feeder schools and improved awareness of student expectations prior to entry: an ongoing exercise; having committed, accessible, responsive and capable teaching staff; the accessibility and responsiveness of teaching staff to first year student issues, as outlined in this thesis, is being addressed in 2007; receiving prompt and helpful feedback on their learning; an issue being addressed by the First Year Teaching Team as an essential element of the teaching and learning process; together with: effective use of an appropriate selection from a myriad of learning strategies and resources which give emphasis to active learning, practice oriented learning, peer supported learning and self-managed learning; supported by a reliable infrastructure and support systems; and consistently encountering staff that are responsive and committed to giving service to student support. Results suggest the following recommendations for improving the retention of first year students. Involve staff in retention measures: Streamline pre-enrolment information: Keep all student promises &#8211; e.g. in Unit Outlines and assessment plans: Identify high-risk students early: Cater for poor UAIs and maths/science: Minimise administrative barriers: Appoint a first-year mentor/coordinator: For First year Student Orientation, the student&#8217;s first exposure to the UWS			campus: Aim for 100% attendance: Ensure user-friendliness: Address student expectations :Address aims of the Orientation program: Ensure all key staff easily available: Avoid information overload: Regularly review and modify the program on an annual basis: Ensure full academic-administrative liaison: Ease tutorial registration and offer instant online interactive timetable confirmation: Streamline induction information on a CD or a School web site: Adopt a team approach to teaching First Year Units: Consider alternative peer-mentor models: Strengthen academic mentoring: Ensure staff consultation availability: Regularly encourage prompt attendance and submission of assignments &#8211; a study discipline: Address travel problems: Address campus facilities: Promote learning skills awareness: Encourage students to seek help and: Follow up all student queries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Western Sydney</field><field name="subject">engineering students</field><field name="subject">student retention</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (higher)</field><field name="subject">college dropouts</field><field name="subject">college attendance</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family-friendly organisations (FFOs) : policies, provisions, practices and organisational culture</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, Santha</field><field name="description">Contemporary interest in and demand for a healthy balance between work and family/life (WF/L) commitments has resulted in the proliferation of organisations commonly referred to as family-friendly workplaces (FFWs). Such a proliferation has been met with assertions that WF/L balance is as much organisational rhetoric as it is organisational reality. Such claims are damaging for organisations that are genuinely committed to providing WF/L-friendly work environments. Additionally, such allegations if true also indicate a more serious problem of organisational ineffectiveness. This study therefore perceives a way by which FFWs can test and evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts to provide employees with WF/L balance. Three research questions drive this study: Why are FFWs&#8217; efforts to provide WF/L balance regarded as rhetoric? What is the gap level between WF/L balance rhetoric and reality in an organisation? What organisational issues and challenges contribute to the rhetoric claim? In the absence of models or frameworks that can effectively test and measure rhetoric-reality gaps this research may be considered as &#8216;experimental&#8217;, since it introduces a new conceptual framework, &#8216;The rhetoric-reality discrepancy framework&#8217;. The framework illustrates how gaps arise and highlights key underlying contributing factors. These factors represent organisational challenges that impede WF/L balance for employees, and indicate areas that organisations need to address if they wish to dispel claims that WF/L balance is more rhetoric than reality. The &#8216;experimental&#8217; nature of this framework meant that a within-case approach was the obvious choice, as it allows for the thorough study of the research problem within one organisational setting. The study was based on a case analysis of an Australian organisation that promotes itself as and has achieved formal recognition as a FFW, through nominating itself for and subsequently winning national-level work and family awards. The dual-centred nature of the research inquiry meant that a mixed paradigmatic approach was selected. A positivist approach was used to measure gap levels while an interpretivist approach was used to guide understanding of underlying contributors of these gaps. Additionally, the combined paradigm meant that the choice of research methodology was framed by a mixed methods approach. Quantitative tools such as a questionnaire survey and qualitative channels such as document analysis, personal interviews and participant observation were used. In line with Creswell&#8217;s Sequential Exploratory Design (11.2a), fieldwork commenced with the quantitative phase and on its completion was followed by the qualitative phase. SPSS software was the predominant tool used in the quantitative analytical phase while NVivo software was used in the qualitative phase. Three areas of employee experiences - their awareness of, need for, and take up of WF/L balance initiatives - were used to explore the magnitude of the rhetoric-reality gap, while the qualitative phase sought to understand what caused the gaps, what employees thought of their organisation&#8217;s efforts, and uncover emergent themes. The two methods were &#8216;mixed&#8217; in the final stage of the study, and provided a rich and deeper understanding of the research problem. The quantitative results showed that employees had less than satisfactory experiences in all three areas and further supported the notion that WF/L balance may be more rhetoric than reality. The qualitative findings identified a number of contributing factors, many of which could be broadly categorised under key themes in existing literature, such as poor communication, organisational culture, differential access, cost considerations, and managerial discretion. The study also uncovered other issues that could contribute to organisational rhetoric, such as implementation challenges. One such challenge involved			an organisational need to cater for a diverse workforce and therefore to provide a broad range of initiatives. Another finding is that need for particular provisions is closely linked to employees&#8217; life stage. Both these issues mean that while organisations should offer a wide range of provisions there is also the strong likelihood that a good number of provisions may have very poor take up or have no take up. An emergent theme, though linked to few participants only, was the set of WF/L balance challenges faced by first generation Australians or immigrant workers. Another finding which appears to contradict the gap level finding of organisational rhetoric is that a number of employees either specifically identified their organisation as being WF/L-friendly or identified that flexibility was a key ingredient of WF/L balance and acknowledged that their organisation provided such flexibility.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work-life balance</field><field name="subject">work and family</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="subject">quality of work life</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re'fitting the task to man' : activating open source methodologies for industrial design</field><field name="creator">Desai, Gaurang</field><field name="description">Both, market forces and public systems are unable to provide remote rural communities of developing countries with contextually relevant and appropriate technologies. This is because the number of people and their incomes are too low, to constitute either a market or a political constituency. Consequently, development aid and development projects emerge as the primary means of introducing new technologies to these regions. However developmentalism is heavily inscribed with economic determinism resulting in the conception of technologies that are focused at the level of the nation state and whose primary objective is to increase its productive and consumptive capacity in an attempt to jumpstart economic growth. This results in mass technologies that are inherently violent, ecologically damaging and which restrict individual freedoms. Furthermore, these technologies end up replacing rather than building upon the only resource in which the poor are rich; traditional knowledge and the ability to innovate and contextualize technologies to their own local worlds. How can we disembed the conception of technologies from development aid and build upon the resources of the poor instead of seeking to replace them? How can we create a knowledge network that assists in taking the technological innovations of the poor from concept to market and which protects intellectual property rights and allows follow-on innovation. The emergence of networked computing accompanied by new paradigms of production such as peer to peer and open source along with a rethinking of the &#8216;commons&#8217; which not only reduces development costs but also geographic barriers to collaboration presents us with a unique opportunity to satisfy these conditions. This thesis will therefore explore the feasibility of engaging with Open Source methodologies for facilitating user led technology innovations in developing countries. This includes the many operational and disciplinary challenges that must be addressed before seeking to contextualize Open Source methodologies for the Industrial Design process. It will investigate the intrinsic character of computer software and its development process for insights that can help determine if the open source methodology can be extended to Industrial Designers and the Industrial Design discipline. If yes, what forms of contextualization would be required? Finally, this study will conclude by outlining guidelines and an architecture for the conception of an Open source Community that facilitates user led technology development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial design</field><field name="subject">technological innovations</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">open source</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subjectivity at work</field><field name="creator">Bansel, Peter</field><field name="description">In this thesis I contemplate the work that subjects perform when giving accounts of themselves, and the work that researchers might perform when working with those accounts. It is composed of a series of philosophical contemplations emergent from reflections upon my experience of conducting life-history narrative interviews with forty people aged between eighteen and sixty-five. It is motivated by questions about the practices through which subjects, their experiences and their accounts of that experience are constituted and articulated. It is motivated, too, by ethical questions related to the practices through which researchers engage with the accounts that subjects of research give of themselves. It is a reflexive project in which my presence as researcher and author is figured as an intellectual resource. This is accomplished through the inclusion of a self-conscious textual &#8216;I&#8217; who gives an account of himself. I ask how we might understand biographical accounts of experience to have been constituted and performed as accounts, and their narrators to have been constituted and performed as narrating and narratable subjects. In pursuing these questions I trace and articulate those temporalised and spatialised practices and relations through which subjects are constituted, and constituted as intelligible to themselves and each other. I work to give an account of subjects as the play of possibilities within, and differences among, intersecting repertoires of regulatory and regularising technologies of subjectification. I resist, however, giving accounts of subjects that suggest that they are reducible to these technologies. I am, then, concerned with articulating a subject who is simultaneously, paradoxically, regulated and irreducible, knowable and not. These concerns are articulated and performed through contemplation of philosophical and ethical questions related to working with transcriptions of life-history narrative interviews. Rather than suppose the transcribed interview to be a patient text awaiting interpretation, I perform the act of approaching the text with patience. I work with transcriptions of narrative interviews as resources for the reflexive development of my theorising, and for the articulation and performance of patient theorising through deferral of close attention to one narrative until the final chapter. I work with theory in this way, not as if there is a hypothesis to be tested through research, but with research as a space through which questions of theory might be developed. I open the text to philosophical questions, propositions and concepts motivated more towards further openings rather than closures. It is an assemblage of thoughts, knowledges, relations, memories and forgettings which instantiate multiple trajectories that arc in multiple directions without necessarily meeting or arriving. It is a text of bits and fragments, absences and presences, inclusions and omissions, locutions and lacunae.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">narrative interviews</field><field name="subject">social sciences</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/42819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manumalo: a study of factors which facilitate success for New Zealand-born Samoan students at university</field><field name="creator">Penn, Rosemarie</field><field name="description">This thesis is about factors which aid and hinder successful completions for New Zealand-born Samoans. The thesis explores the proposition that educational marginalisation of minority students will be perpetuated until AUT adopts policies and procedures which enable culturally responsive educational pedagogies and practices which honour indigenous minorities. The thesis asked New Zealand-born Samoan students, what is the nature of their aiga (family) and cultural support frameworks (structures), and, further, to what extent and how and why do these students engage with such networks (processes)? This study used a qualitative approach within which six New Zealand-born Samoan students were interviewed using a semi-structured approach to gathering data. The interview data were transcribed and a thematic analysis was manually completed both within and across the six cases. The turnaround time in gaining ethics approval impacted upon the capacity of the investigator to conduct this research in what she considered to be a culturally appropriate manner and the cautious vigilance of the final ethics committee approval was perceived as a barrier to making culturally appropriate contact. It was discovered that Samoan structures, especially family, are paramount in supporting educational success because of the Fa&#8217;a Samoa processes which they engender. A further discovery was that New Zealand-born Samoans retain cultural affiliations so their lifestyle shows deep regard for Fa&#8217;a Samoa identity. Through these affiliations, meaningful life metaphors become applied. It was concluded that transforming staff so that they understand Pasifika peoples is crucial to growing Pasifika educational success. Staff development must, therefore, be planned so that meaningful understandings of Pasifika concepts and frameworks become nurtured and that is a challenge which AUT must embrace and action.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand-born</field><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of New Zealand nephrite for forensic purposes</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Gareth Peter</field><field name="description">This study investigated the discrimination between sources of the semi-precious mineral, nephrite, by a targeted microanalytical determination of the elemental composition, including the trace elements. Nephrite specimens were collected from two significant nephrite sources in New Zealand, namely the Westland and Wakatipu fields, and combined with donated specimens from the Southland field to complete a representative collection of New Zealand nephrite.  A small number of nephrite specimens were donated from the South Westland nephrite field and from foreign sources.  Representative fragments of these specimens were analysed by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) for major elements and by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for trace elements. The data obtained by the analytical procedure were treated within a compositional data (CoDa) framework of statistical analysis that focuses on the relative sizes of the components in the data set.  The data were transformed under the guidelines of the CoDa framework, where appropriate, and the transformed data were treated with standard statistical methods for exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction and discriminant analysis.  Advances were made to the Hotelling&#8217;s   method for comparison of multivariate means by incorporating a permutation evaluation step.  This permutation method removes the requirement for multivariate normality, and it also allows comparisons to be made when there are many more variables than observations, as is often the case when objects are being characterized using elemental data. The strategy used in this study showed that it is possible to discriminate between sources of nephrite at both an intra- and inter-source level within New Zealand.  In addition, an exploratory investigation showed that New Zealand nephrite could be differentiated from the few nephrite specimens from foreign sources that were available for comparison. Recommendations are made for the protection of the New Zealand nephrite resource and for casework, based on the results obtained in this study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forensic science</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">compositional data analysis</field><field name="subject">nephrite</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The usage of traditional Maori narratives as cognitive models and educational tools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Benavides, Sebastian Pelayo</field><field name="description">The present research consists of an interdisciplinary approach which combines mainly sub-disciplines from the anthropological and psychological perspectives as theoretical background. Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern &#8211;how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction and transmission of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Maori folklore</field><field name="subject">Maori stories</field><field name="subject">cognitive models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fairness, forgiveness and grudge-holding: experimental studies with primary school children in New Zealand : thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yamaguchi, Tomoko</field><field name="description">Fairness, forgiveness and grudge-holding are concepts which underlie many aspects of our interpersonal relationships. Fairness is the foundation of our day-to-day communication with others and forgiveness is concerned with a positive strategy used to manage negative emotional experiences of underserved [i.e. undeserved] unfair treatment. Grudge-holding results as an accumulation of negative feelings, which are associated with the original experience of unfairness. Two experimental studies investigated children&#8217;s perceptions of, feelings about, and reactions towards the unfair behaviour of a mother and a friend, by individually inviting the children to scenario-based interview sessions, which included three imaginary tasks. The children were asked to judge the fairness of a mother and a best friend&#8217;s treatment towards a child protagonist and to report their associated feelings, after listening to a scenario that described an interaction between a child and a mother and an interaction between a child and a friend. They further responded to three scenario-based experimental tasks, regarding their willingness to grant forgiveness, as opposed to expressions of hostility. In the first study, the children&#8217;s willingness to forgive, as a result of unfairness, was explored with 82 local primary school children in Palmerston North, New Zealand, whose ages ranged from 8- to 11-years-old, in addition to 50 parents of these participating children. The parents also completed a questionnaire about their approaches to their children&#8217;s common misbehaviours. The study found that the children were typically willing to grant forgiveness to a mother, even though she had been unfair. Their forgiveness tendencies were not related to aspects of parental disciplinary behaviour. However, an examination of the children&#8217;s verbatim responses through the use of thematic analysis revealed the complex nature of the relationship between parent and child concerning tolerance for mistakes. In the second study, I explored on whether the children&#8217;s repeated exposure to unfairness would contribute to their display of grudge-holding against a mother or a best friend in the scenarios and this investigation involved 55 local primary children, whose ages ranged from 8- to 12-years-old, in Wellington, New Zealand. The children participated in individual scenario-based interview sessions, which included three imaginary tasks over the two time periods, one week apart from each other. The children&#8217;s levels of grudge-holding was measured by analysing the possible increase in hostility, which the children expressed from Time 1 to Time 2. The study showed that a repeated experience of unfairness had a noticeable effect on the children&#8217;s level of hostility towards the person who was unfair and especially towards the best friend. The children&#8217;s verbatim comments also suggested some evidence of accumulated negativity in their responses to an unfairness experience. Thus, this study proved to be a suitable paradigm for operationalising grudge-holding in children.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">negative feelings</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine protected area : a case study in north-easter Iloilo, Philippines : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Economics, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, Cheryl Joy Jardiolin</field><field name="description">Marine Protected Area (MPA), as a fisheries management tool has been promoted by both national and local conservationists and has provided de facto illustrations of integrated coastal management (ICM) in the Philippines. However, conflict is inevitable in the implementation of public policy such as the MPA because of contrasting objectives and expectations from various stakeholders. Coupled with non-human (e.g. MPA size) and human (e.g. mismanagement) threats, conflict becomes a hindrance to MPA effectivity. In the Philippines alone, only 10-20% of the 500 MPAs are attaining their objectives. This study presents an overview of MPA management and examines the interaction between the civil society and market forces of institutional arrangements in the case of North-Eastern Iloilo (NI) in the Philippines. It discusses overall scenarios that resemble conflict between various national, local and international sectors, assessing MPA success factors and the expected implications from such implementation. Results from key informant, focus-group discussion and social survey show that there are problems on MPA management in the region. Using data and strategic analyses, it presents that minimisation of conflicts amongst actors should be the primary goal of the NI municipalities. In addition, MPA size and membership to organisations are also significant factors of success. Moreover, the analysis from a simple correlation to complex Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) conclude that information on MPA regulation does not directly contribute to the improvement in MPA management. It implies that a focus on informing stakeholders about the benefits of having an MPA and its regulations is ineffective. The focus should be on the reduction of conflict between economic actors - for free riding problems are currently occurring, thus minimising conflict by conflict resolution and proper incentives. However, there are still remaining challenges on MPA management, for not all factors are incorporated on this study. The challenge now is on how to identify the remaining factors and integrate them into policies and implementations to improve the overall condition of coastal communities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal management</field><field name="subject">fisheries management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340202 Environment and resource economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tradition, invention, and innovation : multiple reflections of an urban marae : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">George, Lily (L.M.)</field><field name="description">Marae have a place in contemporary Aotearoa New Zealand that is vital to Maori culture, as well as for all peoples of this land. Maori cultural precepts intrinsically abound with notions of the importance of marae for the transmission of that culture. Marae are places of refuge and learning where the active expression of Maori culture is most obvious. Tendrils of tradition incorporated with contemporary nuances reach out to enfold those whom these places and spaces nurture and embrace. While these ideals may not always find articulation in reality, their presence at the least provides a foundation centuries old on which to build pathways in the present and into the future. Awataha Marae is an urban marae based on Auckland?s North Shore. The history of Awataha is situated within the latest of three Renaissance Periods in which there was an upsurge in Maori culture. These Renaissance Periods were about resistance to the impositions of another culture, reclamation of part of what had been lost through colonisation, and rejuvenation of people and culture. Renaissance Period Three, in which Awataha arose, also has connections to the efforts of indigenous peoples worldwide in their endeavours to forge self determining processes for themselves, including those of conducting research that was for their benefit and purposes, rather than for those of others. Following the development of marae from pre-contact to the present day also illuminates the context within which Awataha was formed. From its beginnings as the space in front of the chief?s house where the village members gathered and where relationships were negotiated, marae today are complexes of buildings that reflect the necessities of the society that surrounds them, as well as the desire of the people to retain Maori culture in its most fundamental form. Urban marae have arisen to fulfil those desires for Maori in urban contexts, often separated from their rural homelands and for many, from their cultural heritage. Following changes in the ways in which wharenui were decorated and embellished also provides evidence of the ways in which Maori consciously innovated culture in order to endure in the new world.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori culture</field><field name="subject">Awataha marae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Titiro whakamuri kia marama ai te wao nei : whakapapa epistemologies and Maniapoto Maori cultural identities : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Shane</field><field name="description">The work I have presented here pulls together Maori epistemologies as evidenced in the whakapapa knowledge particularly of Ngati Maniapoto to see if and where connection lies with understandings of Maori cultural wellbeing. Whakapapa knowledge is the unbounded collection of theory, observation and experience as seen through Maori eyes. It is intricately connected by whakapapa, a tool for working with and extrapolating understanding and is the common thread that binds hapu, whanau and iwi (O&#8217;Regan, 2001). The aim is to investigate contemporary Maori realities with a strong interest in these traditions of wisdom and knowing. The rangahau presented here is of necessity both deconstructive and reconstructive. As a deconstructive project the rangahau seeks to place under the microscope of indigenous gaze the colonial theoretical, ethical, moral and political construction of Maori ways of knowing and being and the ontological orders of western paradigms and non-Maori worldview (Romero-Little, 2006). As a constructive project I am concerned with placing on the record and opening up sites for, but not defining, Maori epistemology as legitimate and &#8216;tika&#8217; and at the same time putting forward &#8216;alternate epistemologies&#8217; (Collins, 1991; Lopez, 1998; Smith, 1999; Marsden, 2003) that challenge certified knowledge and critically challenges dominant constructions of the truth as related to knowing. The implications of these explorations of epistemologies for Maori lives, opportunities and experience are also considered. This work argues for the maintenance of Maori cultural identities via whakapapa knowledge using connections to Maori ways of knowing. This includes examination of the effects of coming to terms with, of encountering, coming to terms with and engaging with Maori cultural practices, as well as, processes commonly referred to as &#8216;culture shock&#8217; (Weaver, 1993) the psychological, emotional and physical responses to the phenomenon of identity reclamation and how these realities can be negotiated. What I found is that Maori knowledge systems are replete with elements that contribute positively to the maintenance of cultural identities and these identities are uniquely and distinctively contextually and culturally relevant. These systems have been and continue to be threatened by the impacts of colonisation and colonial ideologies. The work has found that elders and relevant contexts retain and provide a large volume of knowledge that when engaged with can provide useful insights into living within Maori paradigms that can enhance wellbeing in the present. Maori communities and whanau are under high levels of stress with the pressures of contemporary living and the dis-location from ancestral lands, and the living activities, knowledge sharing opportunities and learning practices they support. This work seeks to offer up solutions via the maintenance, enhancement and advancement of cultural identities as a way for mediating and removing some of the effects of the stresses. The implications are that the continued disconnection of Maori from unique cultural identities informed by whakapapa korero knowledge may serve to weaken important elements and connections to an individual&#8217;s and group&#8217;s cultural identity, including personal history, stories, land and people. The potential exists for further investigation of how crucial cultural connections that acknowledge contemporary realities and yet support the maintenance of cultural identities with strong and vibrant connections to whakapapa korero knowledge connections might be maintained, enhanced and advanced. Additionally, the work here opens up the space for and advocates for much deeper exploration of distinctive elements of a groups identity through contextually located knowledge in forms such as waiata, purakau, pakiwaitara, whakairo, rongoa, wairua and the many other knowledge forms of tea o Maori to further depths/heights not yet achieved to reclaim (k)new and subjugated knowledge forms. This potential is exciting but there are a range of risks involved (including appropriations of indigenous knowledge) that requires certain minimum standards of knowledge protection such as discerning which knowledge is suitable for public consumption and that which is not. This is most suitably done after receiving guidance from the knowledge holders as to what the appropriate forums for such knowledge might be and analysing risks for abuse, risks of misinterpretation and risks of unintended use that might cause whakama. The enquiry suggested above as being of benefit is of course a deeply personal exploration and ideas of what is appropriate for public consumption and what is not is something that must be explored at the time of enquiry. As in my work here I was asked to include some things and to exclude others as a result of views by the elders that the public consumption of some knowledge they contributed was inappropriate to be shared beyond our korero because it could be perceived in a number of ways, some helpful and some not, for the people concerned, or for different groups of people. The knowledge that has been shared here and that which has not has therefore been discerned.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ngati Maniapoto</field><field name="subject">Maori traditions</field><field name="subject">cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social attitudes towards the New Zealand superannuation scheme : a manifestation of normative intergenerational justice : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Sociology at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Gribben, Melodie Jo</field><field name="description">The purpose of the current study is to investigate New Zealanders&#8217; social attitudes towards the economic support for the aged provided by the New Zealand Superannuation Scheme. The structure and nature of those social attitudes is revealed. The study examines social attitude responses to determine if intergenerational justice plays any role in the nature of support for the aged. One thousand and eighty-three participants were selected from the electoral roll and all were sent a survey pack followed by two subsequent reminders. Five hundred and nineteen people agreed to participate. The hypothesis is that New Zealanders agree that economic support for the aged should be provided through the Superannuation Scheme, but that the nature of this support varies according to demographic characteristics and individual perceptions of intergenerational justice. The survey results found that respondents support the economic provision for the aged in the current Superannuation Scheme. However, they are less prepared to support those mechanisms that maintain the Superannuation Scheme and they consider intergenerational transferability of the Superannuation Scheme as important. A generational difference was found in the survey among younger respondents, those forty-one and below, with regard to need taking precedence for supporting the aged, concerning ideas about assessing the economic circumstances of the aged and ideas about the balance of &#8216;advantages and disadvantages&#8217; distributed to different generations. Older generations, those respondents aged forty-two and above, supported the social democratic form of the Superannuation Scheme. They believed that entitlement to returns was more important than need and they opposed economic assessments for the receipt of the Superannuation Benefit. However, older generations did not believe that differences in the balance of &#8216;advantages and disadvantages&#8217; between generations have occurred in New Zealand. The survey results indicate that New Zealand is unique compared with other developed countries in that there is little predictor value or correlation value for most of the demographic characteristics pertaining to welfare attitudes towards the economic support of the aged. Meanwhile, generation and household income have some predictor and correlation value in relation to welfare attitudes towards the New Zealand Superannuation Scheme. Finally, the Superannuation Scheme exists in a momentary formal state. It may be the non-transferability of this Scheme between generations that poses a threat to the economic support of the aged, given that the number of people in New Zealand reaching sixty-five is set to increase dramatically.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">economic support</field><field name="subject">welfare attitudes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakatangata kia kaha : toit&#363; te whakapapa, toit&#363; te tuakiri, toit&#363; te mana : an examination of the contribution of Te Aute College to M&#257;ori advancement : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Graham, James Philip Hector</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the contribution of Te Aute College to Maori advancement by exploring the whakapapa of Te Aute College and the brand that has developed out of the school&#8217;s whakapapa from its beginnings in 1854 prior to major European settlement in the Hawkes Bay through to the 21st century. In doing so, the notion of whakapapa is used to reveal the layers of tradition, history, connections, narratives, achievements and setbacks that have enabled the realisation of Maori potential and the ability of Te Aute College to sustain a contribution to the advancement of Maori. This thesis contends that the contribution of Te Aute College to Maori advancement stems from its whakapapa and its brand that is unequivocally Te Aute in focus and character. An Indigenous Maori research paradigm, a whakapapa research methodology, provides the context for researching Te Aute College, the basis of this thesis. The thesis also explores whakapapa as a tool that can be used as a legitimate research framework when engaging in Maori research. It posits an Indigenous Maori research approach as a paradigm base for a philosophical and theoretical discourse when researching Maori institutions and communities. This thesis signifies the continuation of both a personal and professional journey that originates from the author&#8217;s enduring interest in and sense of obligation to contributing to the story of Te Aute College. The initial thesis discourse contextualises the research through a historical chronology of the tangata whenua connection to the research community; of the first 150 years of Te Aute College providing education for predominantly young male Maori and of the &#8216;special character&#8217; education that is offered by Te Aute College today. Three interconnecting themes provide the systematic basis for exploring the distinctive yet simultaneously universal layers of Te Aute College that emerged as significant to this research; the Te Aute Experience, the contribution of Te Aute College and He Toa Takitini - Collaboration. Finally, an analysis is given of these themes in conjunction with the whakapapa of Te Aute College and the future role of Te Aute College in sustaining its contribution to the advancement of Maori.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori education</field><field name="subject">Te Aute College history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of violence in intimate relationships: a critical examination of legal responses</field><field name="creator">Buckingham, Judith Isabel</field><field name="description">In this thesis, red flags for dangerousness/lethality established from domestic violence and homicide research provided the social framework for an examination of legal responses to violence in intimate heterosexual relationships. The research investigated these gendered, structural patterns of violence and the effectiveness of criminal justice interventions in keeping victims safe. Agency interactions with offenders and victims prior to women's deaths were reviewed in selected cases. Criminal law constructions of violence in intimate relationships were evaluated for their recognition and understanding of primary risk factors for dangerousness/lethality. The research found major red flags remain invisible in criminal law stereotypes of violence between intimates. The significance of these risk factors for dangerousness/lethality is therefore overlooked, misunderstood and even misrepresented in defence of violent offenders. Although the aim of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 is to ensure effective protection for victims, the study found a significant number of women (and sometimes other family members and children) experience further sub-lethal and lethal violence following legal interventions with perpetrators. Lacking a principled policy foundation, central focus on victim safety and clear framework for interventions, legal responses are internally incoherent and inconsistent with New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy. The New Zealand government has committed to principled domestic violence intervention and consistency in law and policy. This will require: a) legislative reform; b) public and professional education on the dynamics of violent relationships, including the interrelationship between sublethal and lethal assaults; and c) monitoring of criminal justice interventions to improve accountability. Until this is accomplished, stories of abused women and their children, including informal attempts to seek help and contact with state and community agencies will continue to be dishonoured by a legal system which silences their voices and fails to learn lessons from their injuries and deaths.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic violence</field><field name="subject">homicide</field><field name="subject">fatality review</field><field name="subject">criminal law</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">red flags for dangerousness/lethality</field><field name="subject">battered women</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="subject">criminal jusitce</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Can International Law Achieve the Effective Disarmament of Chemical Weapons?'</field><field name="creator">Lefevre, Peggy</field><field name="description">Chemical weapons are a threat to international security. According to an international convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), all chemical weapons fall under a stringent and irreversible disarmament regime that seeks the abolition of the use and existence of chemical weapons altogether. The CWC is considered to be the first verifiable disarmament treaty; furthermore, it targets an entire category of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).     Unfortunately there is a gap between the legal requirements of the CWC disarmament regime and its implementation. This gap between the theoretical and practical aspects of disarmament implies a practical, result-based approach to disarmament throughout this study; it raises doubts about the feasibility of chemical weapons disarmament under international law. The central question of this study is whether international law can achieve the effective disarmament of chemical weapons.      A background on the chemical weapons disarmament regime is provided in this study. The legal control of chemical weapons follows a clear evolution, from the ban on the use of chemical weapons in conflicts to the international consensus to disarm them altogether. Concerning the legal control for chemical weapons, questions arise about the type of instrument suited for effective disarmament.      As of August 2006 the CWC had been in force for nine years; it is considered to be a well-established treaty and benefits from a very broad membership. However, the disarmament of chemical weapons knows many political, technical and financial difficutlies. It is behind the schedule imposed by the CWC and weapons possessors struggle to meet the environmental and technical requirements provided in the CWC. Throughout this study these difficulties are examined and illustrated with case studies of the main weapons possessors. Such difficulties highlight numerous flaws in the legal regime, at the time of its constitution and during its implementation. Furthermore, they have serious implications for the credibility and authority of that regime.      The chemical weapons disarmament regime, as well as other traditional arms control and disarmament instruments, currently evolves in a changing international security environment that is characterized by new threats. The CWC is challenged by new national and international security policies which rely less on traditional legal instruments and more on alternative, political instruments. The role of treaties such as the CWC is questioned and challenged, which in turn threatens the continuation of and commitment in chemical weapons disarmament. This study concludes with an analysis of the evolution of the chemical weapons disarmament regime in this changing environment, and proposes alternatives and changes that are more suitable for achieving effective disarmament. While the weaknesses of the chemical weapons disarmament regime must be acknowledged, it remains a useful security tool; there are no grounds to question its existence entirely.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International law</field><field name="subject">disarmament</field><field name="subject">chemical weapons</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Juvenile Justice: A comparison between the laws of New Zealand and Germany</field><field name="creator">Wiese, Katja Kristina</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to make a contribution to the controversial subject of how the German youth justice system could be reformed. In this context, this thesis aims to discover innovative strategies that might be implemented into German youth justice law. As New Zealand's juvenile justice system, which was established under the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, has become the centre of extensive international attention and has already been adopted and adapted by other jurisdictions, this thesis focuses on the question whether parts of New Zealand's legislation could be transplanted into German youth justice law. For these purposes, the method of Comparative Law is employed. Accordingly, New Zealand's and Germany's social, legal, historical and cultural background are briefly outlined and compared. This comparison reveals that an implementation of concepts of New Zealand law into German law would generally be possible. The historical development of distinct youth justice systems in both countries are presented and differences and similarities are compiled. Both countries' current youth justice legislations are then critically examined. This thesis further provides an evaluation of the practical effectiveness of New Zealand's youth justice system. In this regard, this research is exploratory and qualitative, drawing on semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners working in the field of youth justice. The comparative and qualitative research identified many strengths as well as some weaknesses of the current youth justice system in New Zealand. Consequently, this thesis comes to the conclusion that an implementation of a youth justice forum comparable to New Zealand's Family Group Conference would be expedient and worthwhile from Germany's perspective, but that some aspects of the New Zealand system like police diversion and the formal court orders, cannot or should not be introduced in Germany. Regarding the latter topic, the comparison of both systems revealed that New Zealand might even be inspired by the German option of imposing youth prison sentences on recidivist offenders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth justice</field><field name="subject">comparison Germany and New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Against God and Sovereign: A study of blasphemy and Sunday laws</field><field name="creator">Higgins, Errol Terrance</field><field name="description">The aim of this manuscript is to show the historical development of blasphemy and Sunday laws, their relationship, their similarities and differences, their origins and justifications, their importance in the area of religious liberty.

For the development of human rights protection mechanisms within regional organizations the governments of the member states are of special relevance. They pull the strings to either foster and develop a system or to disrupt it. Therefore, following a brief historical introduction, the first chapter gives an overview of the regional African organization, the former Organization of African Unity (OAU) and today's African Union (AU) which was instrumental in the establishment of the African Human Rights System and has now enhanced it by adding a judicial authority. However, it will become clear that is has taken a long time for the OAU to put human rights violations within the borders of its own member states on its agenda: Not until there was increasing international pressure due to never-ending excrescences of violence in the dictatorial regimes in Africa did the OAU carefully attend to this matter in the late 1970s. Its efforts culminated in the adoption of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the eponymous Banjul Charter) which entered into force in 1981. The body for the protection created by the Charter was the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights which took up its function in 1987. Since the newly established African Court is not supposed to replace the Commission but rather to strengthen it, the Court operates in concert with the Commission. Therefore the old protection system will still be applicable which deems a portrayal of the system in the following chapter necessary. Here, it will be outlined, that the competences of the Commission remain very limited and that its judicial impact on the State parties involved in its protection procedures has been nearly nil up to this very day. Against this background the next chapter focuses on the Protocol to the Banjul-Charter establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. First, the historical-political background and the protocol's juridical formulation process are examined. Here it will be shown that the end of global bipolarity has had a remarkable impact on the political protagonists in Africa with the effect that the increasing demands for a human rights Court within the OAU no longer remained completely unheard. It will also be outlined that the path towards the adoption of the protocol has been long and difficult. After a short survey of the organisational structure of the Court it will become clear that the protocol follows to a large extend its Inter-American counterpart concerning the institutional embodiment. However, a remarkable and, in international comparison, a unique achievement has also been achieved by the institutional regulations by making gender equality has one of the key issues to encompass when it comes to the nomination and election of judges. The following chapters outline the jurisdiction of the Court and the judicial process before the Court. In this connection the admissibility criteria will be highlighted in which two remarkable regulations stand out: First, it will become clear that in contrast to other regional human rights courts individuals and NGOs alike are entitled to file a complaint with the African Court (even though initially with the help of the Commission, since the protocol makes the complaint authority of individuals and NGOs dependent of a special declaration of acceptance of the State Parties concerned). Moreover, also unique compared to international two-tier human rights procedures, the protocol does not include a provision according to which a complainant would be obliged to go through a prior Commission procedure before filing a complaint with the Court. Individual complainants rather have direct access to the Court once a declaration of acceptance has been submitted by a State Party to the protocol. Following short remarks on the competence of the Court to issue provisional measures which, among other things, reveal that these measures have, in contrast to those of the ECtHR, binding effect the procedural termination of a complaint comes into focus. Here, the possible contents of the rulings and the control mechanisms for their implementation are being contemplated in a detailed fashion. This last aspect most probably will have great influence on the fate of the Court since the Commission for its part had to a large extent no success due to the fact that it had no conventional implementation procedures to rely on. Therefore, in the vast majority of cases the findings of the Commission trailed off without any State Party concerned paying any attention to it. The drafters of the protocol establishing the Court obviously have learned this lesson since the protocol provides for a quite remarkable implementation mechanism that may be able to impose political and legal pressure alike on State Parties if the Court deems that they have not properly complied with a Court's ruling. Even sanctions within the African Union against a recusant State come into question from a legal point of view - a quantum leap regarding the legal situation under the Banjul Charter. The last chapter rehearses the main findings of the thesis and concludes with a positive outlook on the future development of the African human rights system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International law</field><field name="subject">human rights law</field><field name="subject">regional human rights protection</field><field name="subject">human rights in Africa</field><field name="subject">Human Rights Court</field><field name="subject">Human Rights Commission</field><field name="subject">African Court of Human Rights</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Germ-line Interventions in the International Regime of Human Rights and Human Dignity</field><field name="creator">Haberland, Bastian B.</field><field name="description">Germ-line interventions allow parents to take influence on their child&#8217;s genetic disposition and give scientists the means to eradicate hereditary diseases.

This article begins with an overview of the international regulations dealing with germ-line interventions. It then turns to the question whether there are international human rights that promote a permissive policy towards germ-line interventions, such as the right to health, as opposed to those international rules that seem to restrict the application of germ-line interventions, such as human dignity. The analysis results in the conclusion that the prohibition of germ-line interventions for non-therapeutic purposes is an evolving rule of customary international law.

The thesis positions itself as a call for legislative reform. The central argument is that the Act is an anachronistic and potentially draconian piece of social legislation which has no place on the modern-day New Zealand statute book. In the first part of the thesis, Chapter 1 introduces the research, outlines the structure and methodology of the thesis, and locates the study within a wider tradition of scholarship on the management of people with alcohol problems. Chapter 2 summarises the analytical framework that is used to evaluate the Act, attaching particular importance to both the philosophical traditions and the practical strategies of harm minimisation and therapeutic jurisprudence. Chapter 3 gives a positivist reading of the legislation : outlining the evolution of the Act, essaying its major provisions, and noting the efforts that have been made to refine or reform the statute since it was passed in the mid-1960s. Chapter 4 draws on the limited amount of data available to describe how the Act is currently operating 'on the ground'. In the second part of the thesis, the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act is put into a comparative context by describing examples of similar-type statutes that exist in two other jurisdictions. Chapter 5 focuses on the New South Wales Inebriates Act 1912; Chapter 6 focuses on the Swedish Act on Care of Addicts in Certain Cases 1989. The final part of the thesis builds a case for reform of the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act. Chapter 7 identifies various practical and clinical problems with the Act, which mean that the statute does not work in instrumental terms. It is submitted that the Act cannot be said to make better provision for the care and treatment of alcoholics. Chapter 8 highlights several legal and philosophical difficulties with the Act, which mean that the legislation does not work in value terms. It is submitted that the Act is offensive to the right to refuse treatment and fundamentally conflicts with the principles of individual autonomy and informed consent. Chapter 9 proposes three options for reforming the Act, expressing a preference for the outright repeal of the statute. Finally, Chapter 10 draws conclusions from the preceding discussion, and speculates on the likelihood that the recommended reforms will be implemented.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compulsory treatment</field><field name="subject">alcoholism</field><field name="subject">harm minimisation</field><field name="subject">therapeutic jurisprudence</field><field name="subject">legal policy analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Freedom and Uncertainty: Contemporary liberal theory examined from the perspective of moral uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Barber, Matthew Kelvin</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to use general assertions of moral uncertainty as a perspective by which to explore and illuminate contemporary strands of liberal theory. It examines the work of the earlier contemporary liberal theorists, including John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Ronald Dworkin and Bruce Ackerman, as well as the more recent accounts of liberalism that express ideas of pluralism (Michael Walzer, Joseph Raz, John Gray, William Galston, George Crowder), political liberalism (John Rawls, Charles Larmore), public reason (Amy Gutmann &amp; Dennis Thompson, Gerald Gaus), multiculturalism (Charles Taylor, Will Kymlicka, Brian Barry, James Tully, and Bikhu Parekh), and postmodernism (Richard Rorty). The development from the earlier to more recent liberal theories represents a fundamental shift in justificatory strategy: where earlier liberal conceptions aim at universality, and at overcoming or transcending uncertainty, later approaches make this uncertainty, usually in the form of pluralism or difference, central to the liberal project. In order to achieve this, these latter theories tended to presuppose the circumstances of western society, or western democratic values. Generally speaking, these approaches fail to respond adequately to moral uncertainty, and to meet their own justificatory aims. This manifests, in the earlier theories, as plausible but contestable central conceptions, and, in the more recent theories, as the inability to justify particular liberal conceptions in the face of persistence difference. This is an important result, and suggests the need for further developments in liberal justificatory strategies. I suggest that one viable approach would be for liberal theory to accept moral uncertainty, and work from a model of society and self towards a more successful liberal conception.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="subject">liberal theory</field><field name="subject">moral uncertainty</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Doctrine of Good Faith in New Zealand Contractual Relationships</field><field name="creator">Bayley, John Edward</field><field name="description">The majority of established legal systems are predisposed to the express recognition of good faith in contract. The apparent pressure for harmonisation of contract law arising from globalisation and political union will necessitate the Anglo-Commonwealth common law countries addressing their historical resistance to the observance of a general obligation of good faith. Accordingly this thesis appraises whether there is a requirement for a universal doctrine of good faith in New Zealand contractual relationships. The manuscript focuses on a prospective common law doctrine operating primarily as a rule of construction. It identifies the limits of such a judicial doctrine including its probable lack of application to non-contractual dealings and the likely need for a legislative duty if contracting parties are to be precluded from excluding the obligation. The characteristics of the subject doctrine are explored including the potential definition and uses of good faith. Whilst it is shown that good faith serves an important role in contract law, the analysis reveals that there is no current requirement for an express doctrine within New Zealand. The entrenched &#8216;piecemeal&#8217; approach synonymous with Anglo-New Zealand contract law is not demonstrably deficient when gauged against the reasonable expectations of contracting parties. The current methodology is preferred to a general, unfamiliar and uncertain good faith principle which is likely to be reduced to equate with the existing New Zealand law in any event. Further, duties consonant with good faith may enhance economic efficiency but not in some instances. Good faith is therefore best imposed in specific circumstances rather than as a universal doctrine. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that New Zealand is impaired in the international arena due to a lack of good faith despite pressure for New Zealand to accord with widespread overseas practice. The principle is of minimal utility in international trade where commercial certitude is paramount. Although an imperfect exemplar, the unresolved issues pertaining to contractual good faith in domestic American law confirms the identified reservations associated with the subject doctrine.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">contract</field><field name="subject">contractual</field><field name="subject">contractual relationships</field><field name="subject">doctrine</field><field name="subject">good faith</field><field name="subject">bona fides</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Privacy, Constitutions and the Law of Torts: a Comparative and Theoretical Analysis of Protecting Personal Information Against Dissemination in New Zealand, the UK and the USA.</field><field name="creator">Heite, Martin</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Court of Appeal has recently acknowledged the existence of a freestanding tort of invasion of privacy in Hosking v Runting. The tort is in its infancy and the courts are still grappling with essential problems, the most prominent of which is the conflict with countervailing interests in freedom of speech. In need of guidance, the courts turn to overseas authorities, predominantly from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The commonly found descriptive nature of the comparison invites a broader analysis of these jurisdictions. In this thesis, I offer a theoretically informed comparative law analysis of New Zealand's new tort with the American public disclosure of private facts tort and the British extended breach of confidence action. In all three jurisdictions, the conflict of privacy with individual and societal concerns in freedom of speech has led to an exten-sion of (quasi-) constitutional norms derived, for instance, from the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 into the common law sphere &#8211; the horizontal effect. The horizontal application of constitutional rights poses significant legal problems to the common law, because it has learned to deal with duties rather than rights. The time has come to re-consider the nature of rights in both constitutional and tort law. The comparison shows that New Zealand has effectively adopted two torts &#8211; one following the duty-based lead of the United States of America and an alternative modelled along the lines of the more rights-orientated British law. The law of the United Kingdom and the USA differ to a degree that calls their comparability into question. I present the preferable British ap-proach as a 'constitutionalised common law tort of privacy.' The results also show that this model represents a competitive third way to traditional solutions based on common law or statute by means of utilising a statutory human rights instrument as an analytical framework for the common law.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reality and Myth: The New Zealand Media and the Chilling Effect of Defamation Law</field><field name="creator">Cheer, Ursula Jan</field><field name="description">In 2001, I began the field work in an empirical study of the laws of defamation in New Zealand. This study involved a comprehensive mail-out survey of the New Zealand media, and an adapted survey of defamation lawyers, which were designed to discover how the laws of defamation affected both groups, and what the respondents thought about those laws. The survey was augmented by an extensive search of defamation court files in the most important New Zealand High Court registries. The question behind the survey was essentially whether New Zealand&#8217;s defamation laws have a chilling effect on the media, to the extent that stories which should be told do not see the light of day. In this thesis, I contextualise and report on the results of the survey. I first describe and analyse the sources and trends in current defamation law, the other forms of regulation of the media in New Zealand, and the patterns of media ownership. I go on to utilise background data from the survey to present a character and business profile of the media who responded to the survey and find the data confirms the representative nature of those respondents. I then complete contextualisation of the survey by analysing the nature of the chilling effect doctrine itself, a canon which began as a predictive theory importing sociological concepts into legal analysis, but which is now a doctrine applied somewhat inconsistently, but with substantive effects, by the courts. In the following chapters I present the results of the media survey, the court file search and the survey of defamation lawyers, both in narrative and graph or tabular form. My tentative initial finding, that New Zealand&#8217;s defamation laws do not have an excessive chilling effect on our media, although they do have some, is progressively confirmed, with each set of data appearing to mirror and corroborate that which went before. In the final chapters, I take this somewhat surprising finding and augment it by theorising about future developments in defamation law. I suggest that increased constitutionalisation of this area of private law, in the form of full incorporation of a Bill of Rights methodology, is both desirable and necessary to protect against any chilling effects, such as they are. I conclude by posing a question about a possible joint future for defamation and privacy claims.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">defamation</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">chilling effect</field><field name="subject">empirical study</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working for better outcomes: An inquiry into the Rehabilitation and Reintegration of ex-offenders through integration in the labour market as a part of the Criminal Justice process</field><field name="creator">Alexinas, Megan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the place of rehabilitation and reintegration in the criminal justice system.   The aim of the research was to ascertain whether current law, policy and practice are conducive to the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders and the reduction of recidivist offending.  As research shows that offenders who are able to obtain and retain employment are less likely to reoffend, the degree to which current measures facilitate ex-offender employment were examined in particular.  In this context, barriers faced by ex-offenders in obtaining and retaining employment were examined. The research methodology is primarily qualitative, using both primary and secondary information sources, formal and informal.  The research is also informed by a small scale survey of employer attitudes and direct observation by the writer of a community-based employment initiative. The research suggests that viewing criminal offending through a &#8220;human needs&#8221; lens, whereby offender behaviours are seen as directed at the meeting of fundamental needs, provides an appropriate means of understanding and addressing criminal offending. The research concludes that current criminal justice policy lacks the types of measures necessary to rehabilitate and reintegrate ex-offenders.   Specifically, it is argued that there is need for &#8220;throughcare&#8221; (that is, continued support and assistance provided to ex-offenders upon sentence expiry) to be viewed as an integral part of the criminal justice system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">criminal justice</field><field name="subject">offender</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uxorial privileges in substantive criminal law: a comparative law enquiry.</field><field name="creator">McCoy, Gerard John Xavier</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates three exemplars of uxorial substantive privileges in the criminal law: the marital coercion doctrine, the intraspousal conspiracy exemption, and the uxorial post-offence accessorial immunity. Their history, choreography and variations are comparatively investigated across the common law jurisdictions including the impact of statutory interventions. The principal argument is that the judicial and legislative treatment of these uxorial privileges has been inconsistent or erratic so that they are not the products of any systematic, modern development in the criminal law. This thesis proposes that there is no justification for their continued retention in common law legal systems. Archival, Parliamentary, and other sources have been used to identify the factors impinging upon the creation of specific statutory uxorial privileges. The diaspora of these laws throughout the other common law jurisdictions is investigated. The discussion is illustrated by examination of the particular issues raised by polygamy, customary law concubinage as well as by gender-reassignment. This thesis examines whether both gender-specific and marriage-specific criteria are valid constituents within the parameters of substantive criminal law. It traces the genesis of these special defences within the criminal law available exclusively to women, from the time of King Ine of the West Saxons c712, to examine the current status of such laws throughout common law jurisdictions. The investigation explores factors shaping the creation of a statutory defence of marital coercion by the British Parliament in 1925 and outlines the challenges generated by that law and its extraordinary resilience. This thesis demonstrates the failure of the criminal law to provide an overarching construct to implement emergent gender equality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">uxorial privileges in criminal law</field><field name="subject">uxorial privileges</field><field name="subject">uxorial statutory defence</field><field name="subject">marital coercion</field><field name="subject">intraspousal conspiracy</field><field name="subject">uxorial accessorial immunity</field><field name="subject">uxorial privileges in common law</field><field name="subject">criminal law of wives</field><field name="subject">wives in criminal law</field><field name="subject">privileges of spouses in criminal law</field><field name="subject">spousal immunities in criminal law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the efficacy of organ cultures to examine wood formation in Pinus radiata D. Don</field><field name="creator">Putoczki, Tracy Lynn</field><field name="description">Pinus radiata D. Don is an economically important plantation species to New Zealand that is susceptible to the wood quality flaw 'intra-ring checking'. Intra-ring checking is a term used to describe radial fractures that can occur in the earlywood portion of a growth ring, altering the appearance and resilience of the wood, thereby decreasing its economic value. This thesis presents a study that was part of a broad, ongoing collaborative investigation directed at understanding wood quality issues, with the long term goal of enhancement of future radiata pine crops. These investigations are funded by the Wood Quality Initiative Ltd., and involve basic science, field trials and engineering studies related to intra-ring checking. Specifically, the present study was designed to establish the effects of the mineral nutrients boron, calcium and magnesium on wood formation, to determine whether they are associated with intra-ring checking. This research was carried out in three stages. Firstly, the ultra-structural and biochemical properties of wood with intra-ring checking were examined to determine if specific features of the cell wall were associated with the incidence of intra-ring checks. Electron microscopy techniques revealed that the CML/S1 region of the cell wall often showed a decrease in CML lignin staining and S1 striations in wood with intra-ring checks. However, Klason and acetyl bromide assays did not show a change in lignin content. In order to understand how changes in the CML/S1 region of the cell wall may occur, methods were required that would allow for the observation of wood formation in a controlled environment. In the second stage of this study, an organ culture technique was successfully developed to allow for the growth of radiata pine cambial tissue, sandwiched between phloem and xylem, on a defined nutrient medium. This nutrient medium was manipulated, using ion-binding resins, to control the amount of boron, calcium and magnesium available to the growing tissues, to determine if variations in wood formation could be induced. In the final stage of this research, an extensive comparative examination of different techniques that could be used for the observation and measurement of selected wood properties was undertaken, in order to determine the efficacy of the organ cultures to study wood formation in an altered nutrient environment. Wood properties were examined for various stages of xylogenesis, beginning with cell division and expansion, followed by cell wall deposition, and lastly with the onset of lignification in order to define the success of the culture technique. Electron microscopy investigations suggested that in the presence of very little boron the CML/S1 wall showed darker striation deposits, while an increase in calcium availability, resulted in a more defined CML/S1/S2 wall region compared to the controls. Further examination of the cell walls suggested that pectin esterification and possibly lignification could also be increased by limited boron availability. However, in many of the observed and measured parameters of wood properties, a great deal of complex 'between-tree' and 'within-culture' variation was observed. The results show that elucidation of the association between nutrient availability and the incidence of intra-ring checking can not be established from this organ culture study. In a concurrent study, the preliminary investigation of arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) in radiata pine was undertaken. Radiata pine AGPs were positioned in the compound middle lamella of xylem cells, suggesting potential roles in cell-cell adhesion or cell-cell signalling. For the first time, radiata pine AGPs were isolated and characterized in terms of their protein and carbohydrate composition, both of which yielded features typical of AGPs in other plant species. Unique to radiata pine AGPs was the presence of a large proportion of 5-linked arabinose. While the precise function(s) of AGPs are unknown, the results obtained in this research have established a basis for further investigation into the potential for their involvement in wood formation. Overall, new tools have been established to facilitate future research on radiata pine, a commercially important species, and novel results have been obtained concerning the mechanisms of wood formation therein.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arabinogalactan proteins</field><field name="subject">intra-ring checking</field><field name="subject">organ culture</field><field name="subject">wood formation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hormonal control of wood formation in radiata pine</field><field name="creator">Welsh, Shayne</field><field name="description">Pinus radiata is by far the dominant species grown in New Zealand plantations as a  renewable source of wood. Several wood quality issues have been identified in the  material produced, including the high incidence of compression wood, which is  undesirable for end users. At present our understanding of the complex array of  developmental processes involved in wood formation (which has a direct bearing on  wood quality) is limited. Hence, the forest industry is interested in attaining a better  understanding of the processes involved. Towards this goal, and for reasons of  biological curiosity, the experiments described in this thesis were carried out to  investigate several aspects of xylem cell development.  In an in arbor study, changes in the orientation of cortical microtubules and cellulose  microfibrils were observed in developing tracheids. Results obtained provide evidence  that cortical microtubules act to guide cellulose synthase complexes during secondary  wall formation in tracheids.  The mechanisms involved in controlling cell wall deposition in wood cells are poorly  understood, and are difficult to study, especially in arbor. A major part of this thesis  involved the development of an in vitro method for culturing radiata pine wood in  which hormone levels, nutrients, sugars and other factors, could be controlled without  confounding influences from other parts of the tree. The method developed was used  in subsequent parts of this thesis to study compression wood development, and the  influence of the hormone gibberellin on cellulose microfibril organisation in the cell  wall.  Results from the in vitro compression wood experiments suggested that:  1. when a tree is growing at a lean, the developing cell wall was able to perceive  compressive forces generated by the weight of the rest of the tree, rather than  perceive the lean per se. 2. ethylene, rather than auxin, was involved in the induction of compression  wood.  Culture of stem explants with gibberellin resulted in wider cells, with steeper cortical  microtubules, and correspondingly steeper cellulose microfibrils in the S2 layer of  developing wood cells. This observation provides further evidence that the orientation  of microtubules guides the orientation of cellulose microfibrils.  Overall, the work described in this thesis furthers our knowledge in the field of xylem  cell development. The stem culture protocol developed will undoubtedly provide a  valuable tool for future studies to be carried out.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">cytoskeleton</field><field name="subject">microtubules</field><field name="subject">cell wall</field><field name="subject">xylogenesis</field><field name="subject">compression wood</field><field name="subject">microfibrils</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ferrocenes of Substituted Indenyl Ligands</field><field name="creator">Fern, Glen Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the preparation and characterization of a variety of methyl-, trimethylsilyl-, and diphenylphosphino-substituted indenes. The indenes were then used in the preparation of bis(indenyl)iron(II) complexes. The bis(indenyl)iron(II) complexes were characterized by &#185;H, &#185;&#179;C, and &#179;&#185;P-NMR, UV/visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and mass spectrometry. The cyclic voltammetry shows an approximately linear relationship between the oxidation potential and the type of substituent and its ring position, but with increasing substitution leads to lower than expected oxidation potentials. The UV/visible spectra show two absorption bands in the visible region. The position of the bands are essentially unaffected by methyl-substitution, but the low energy band red-shifts with trimethylsilyl- and diphenylphosphino-substitution. Di(2-methylindenyl)iron(II), bis(4,7-dimethyl-indenyl)iron(II), bis(1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)indenyl)iron(II), rac-bis(1-diphenyl-phosphinoindenyl)iron(II),  rac-bis(1-diphenylphosphino-3-methylindenyl)iron(II), and rac-bis(1-diphenylphosphino-2,3-dimethylindenyl)iron(II) were characterized by X-ray crystallography.The planar chiral ferrocenylphosphine bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindenyl)iron(II) is observed to undergo a facile ring-flipping isomerization from the meso isomer to the racemic isomer in THF at ambient temperature. The isomerization is slowed by the addition of the noncoordinating solvent chloroform, but is accelerated by the addition of LiCl. Rate and activation parameters for the isomerization have been determined to be: kobs = 1.6 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#185; at 23 &#8451;, &#916;H&#8225; = 58 &#177; 4 kJ mol&#8315;&#185;, &#916;S&#8225; = &#8722;140 &#177; 15 J mol&#8315;&#185; K&#8315;&#185;. Deuterium labeling of bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindenyl)iron(II) in the 3- and 3&#697;-position ruled out the isomerization proceeding by [1,5]-proton shifts or dissociative mechanisms. The proposed mechanism for the isomerization proceeds via coordination of two THF ligands with ring-slippage of one of the indenyl ligands until it is coordinated through the phosphine. Coordination of the indenyl ligand by the other face leads to the formation of the other isomer.The heterobimetallic complexes (bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindenyl)iron(II))-cis-dichloropalladium(II), (bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindenyl)iron(II))-cis-dichloro-platinum(II), and [(cyclooctadiene)(rac-bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindenyl)iron(II))-rhodium(I)] tetraphenylborate were prepared. Attempts to prepare dichloro(bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindenyl)iron(II))nickel(II) lead to the formation of trans-dichloro(bis(1-diphenylphosphinoindene))nickel(II). The complex (bis(1-diphenyl-phosphinoindenyl)iron(II))-cis-dichloropalladium(II) is able to catalyze the cross-coupling of bromobenzene with n-/sec-butylmagnesium chloride.

For otariids this is especially important since females frequently leave their pups for foraging and must reunite on return. Pups must deal with these fasting periods during maternal absence and consequently may attempt to obtain allomaternal care from unrelated females. This research on the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) at Ohau Point, Kaikoura, New Zealand, quantified mother-pup recognition behaviour during reunions, individuality of pup calls used by mothers to recognise their pup, and the occurrence of allosuckling as a possible recognition error by females and as a strategy employed by pups to gain allomaternal care during their mothers' absence. A combination of behavioural observations, morphometry, VHF radio telemetry, acoustics and DNA genotyping were employed to study these topics. Postpartum interaction behaviours between mothers and pups appeared to facilitate development of an efficient mother-pup recognition system, involving mainly vocal and olfactory cues that were utilised during reunions. Greater selective pressure on pups to reunite resulted in an asymmetry of searching behaviour between females and pups during reunions. The vocalisations of pups were stereotypic, especially those features of the fundamental frequency and frequency of the lowest harmonic, which are likely to facilitate recognition of a pup by their mother. Pups attempted to steal milk from unrelated females more often during maternal absence and appeared to modify the intra-individual variation pattern of a feature of their vocal signatures over this period, which may assist attempts at allosuckling under nutritional stress. Fostering was demonstrated to occur despite costs to filial pups and possible costs to female reproductive success and may be attributed to development of erroneous recognition between females and non filial pups, or kin selection. This study provides a valuable contribution to the knowledge of recognition systems between pinniped mothers and pups, of alternative pup strategies under nutritional stress and of the rare occurrence of fostering in otariid pinnipeds.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal</field><field name="subject">mother-pup reunion</field><field name="subject">allosuckling</field><field name="subject">fostering</field><field name="subject">milk stealing</field><field name="subject">vocalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Profession and Place: Contesting Professional Boundaries at the Margins</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Lee Ethne</field><field name="description">There is considerable concern regarding the adequacy of rural health services in New Zealand, with much attention having been paid to issues of recruitment and retention of rural general practitioners. Rhetoric of 'crisis' is often utilised to raise political awareness of the problematic, but in fact, rural general practitioner recruitment and retention has been documented for about a hundred years. For about the same length of time nurses have been providing primary health care services in rural and remote places, often working alone. Using the notion of nurses as a 'stop-gap' in the provision of rural primary health care until problems with recruitment and retention of rural general practitioners are addressed, is a rhetorical device that facilitates the under analysis of the role nurses play and the contribution that they make. The longstanding practice of rural primary care nursing in its various guises over the last century challenges the notion of nursing as a stop-gap.Any investigation of health care in the contemporary moment needs to take account of the influence of biomedical dominance, an increasingly litigious mentality in relation to health care, a shifting focus towards primary rather than secondary health care, and the positioning and re-positioning of health professionals within the neo-liberal state. The very existence of nurses working as the first point of contact in the health care system, with success over time in so far as they do not provoke undue litigation, and appear to deliver an appropriate service must raise questions about who can claim the right to be a primary health care provider. 	Based on qualitative research conducted in New Zealand and the Western Isles with rural primary care nurses and Family Health Nurses respectively, this thesis explores the ways that nurses construct flexible generalist professional identities that challenge traditional inter and intra-professional boundaries. In the New Zealand case, rural primary care nurses negotiate the boundaries between nursing and medicine, those within nursing itself, and also those between nursing a paramedic work. Nurses perform this boundary work by negotiating self-governing 'appropriate' and 'safe' professional identities. In the Western Isles case, the introduction of the newly developed role of Family Health Nurse serves to highlight the problematic nature of inserting an ostensibly generalist nursing role beyond the rural.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural nursing</field><field name="subject">spatialised professional identity</field><field name="subject">feminised professional work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron Diffraction Studies of Unsupported Antimony Clusters</field><field name="creator">Kaufmann, Martin</field><field name="description">This thesis contains two main parts: the first part focusses on an electron diffraction study on  unsupported antimony (Sb) clusters, while in the second part the design and development of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) is discussed.     Electron diffraction is an ideal tool to study the structure of clusters entrained in a beam. The main advantage of this technique is the ability to study the clusters in situ and in an interaction-free environment. It is therefore not necessary to remove the particles from the vacuum system which would lead to oxidation. Since the particles do not have to be deposited on a sample for further investigation, there is also no substrate which could influence the cluster structure. An additional advantage is the short exposure to the electron beam, thereby minimising the likelihood of damaging the particles.    Sb clusters were produced using an inert-gas aggregation source. To control the cluster properties the source temperature, pressure and type of cooling gas can be adjusted. In the range of source parameters tested, Sb clusters with three different structures were observed: a crystalline structure corresponding to the rhombohedral structure of bulk Sb, an amorphous structure equivalent to the structure of amorphous Sb thin films, and a structure with the same diffraction signature as Sb4 (Sb evaporates mainly as Sb4). This last structure was found to belong to large particles consisting of randomly oriented Sb4 units.    In order to study the size distributions and morphologies of the Sb clusters, the clusters were deposited onto substrates and studied under an electron microscope. The crystalline particles showed a wide variety of strongly faceted shapes. Depending on source conditions, the average cluster diameters ranged from 15 to 130 nm. There was a considerable disagreement between these values and the size estimates from the diffraction results with the latter being smaller by an order of magnitude. This might be due to the existence of domains inside the clusters. The amorphous particles were all found to be spherical with mean sizes between 27 and 45 nm. The Sb4 particles showed a liquid-like morphology and tended to coalesce easily. Their sizes ranged from 18 to 35 nm.    To obtain an independent method for determining the cluster size, a TOFMS was designed and developed in collaboration with Dr Bernhard Kaiser. However, the TOFMS failed to detect a cluster signal in the original set-up which is most likely due to a defective ioniser and underestimated cluster energies. Further tests were performed in a new vacuum system and mass spectra for palladium clusters were successfully recorded.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">clusters</field><field name="subject">electron diffraction</field><field name="subject">Sb</field><field name="subject">amorphous</field><field name="subject">Sb4</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand fur seals in the Kaikoura region:  colony dynamics, maternal investment and  health</field><field name="creator">Boren, Laura Joy</field><field name="description">Colony dynamics, maternal investment, and indicators of health were investigated for  the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) over four austral summers, 2001-  2005. Effort was focused at the Ohau Point seal colony, north of Kaikoura. Two  colonies at Banks Peninsula were included for comparisons of colony growth and pup  condition. A range of other colonies were also included for making comparisons about  colony dynamics and health indices. Colony dynamics were investigated through  mark-recapture estimates of pup production and daily census of all individuals at the  Ohau Point colony. Maternal attendance patterns were observed through behavioural  observations of known females (n = 120), the use of VHF radio transmitters (n = 33),  and female mass and body condition estimates (n = 51). Maternal investment was also  investigated through longitudinal sampling of pup mass and growth rates. Parameters  used to indicate colony health were: body condition, growth, presence of parasites,  and the levels and common causes of mortality. The influence of parasites on pup  growth was tested using treatment of selected pups with Ivermectin anti-helmentic  medication, and mortality in the region was investigated through reports of dead  individuals, and post mortems of those found fresh.  The Ohau Point colony is in an exponential state of growth, and pup mass and  condition was higher and responded to changes in environmental variables differently  than at the Banks Peninsula colonies. Lactation lengths were consistently longer at  Ohau Point than is typically reported for the species (323-355 days vs. 285 days).  Maternal investment strategies were indicative of a close, reliable food source, and  showed flexibility between years through extension of foraging trip durations and the  increased use of overnight foraging trips. Individual strategies did not significantly  influence pup growth. However, increased maternal condition and the ability to  respond to inter-annual changes in resource availability resulted in accelerated pup  growth even during an El Ni&#241;o event. The incidence of pups with intestinal parasites  was low at Ohau Point, and the average mass of treated and non-treated pups did not  differ. Pup mortality in the region was low (3% to 50 days old), however, mortality of  older pups was greatly influenced by the proximity of humans, with 2/3 of pup  mortality observed between the age of 50 days and weaning being caused by car  collisions.  The results suggest that population dynamics and maternal investment in the region  are greatly influenced by local variables, notably the presence of an accessible food  source within close proximity to the colony. Various indicators of health reflect a  growing colony in good condition, and the presence of a reliable food source may  influence the maximum density and carrying capacity the colony is able to sustain.  However, some concerns are raised about the influence of human interactions in the  region, and how this may affect mortality and colony dynamics in the future. Extra  fencing along the Ohau Point colony is recommended to provide added protection  from the road. Continued monitoring of mortality and health indices in the region is  also recommended for comparison with other colonies as Ohau Point reaches carrying  capacity and density-dependent pressures increase.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal</field><field name="subject">Arctocephalus forsteri</field><field name="subject">colony growth</field><field name="subject">maternal investment</field><field name="subject">pup health and condition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing and improving the effectiveness of staff training and warning system response at Whakapapa and Turoa ski areas, Mt. Ruapehu.</field><field name="creator">Christianson, Amy Nadine</field><field name="description">Ruapehu is an active volcano located on the North Island of New Zealand, with the most recent major eruptions occurring in 1945, 1969, 1975, and 1995/96. Ruapehu is also home to the three major North Island ski areas, Whakapapa, Turoa, and Tukino. Because of the high frequency of eruptions, there is a significant volcanic hazard at the ski areas particularly from lahars which can form even after minor eruptions. Most recently, lahars have affected Whakapapa ski area in 1969, 1975, and 1995/96. The most significant risk at Turoa is from ballistic bombs due to the proximity of the top two T-Bars to the crater. Ash fall has also caused disruption at the ski areas, covering the snow and causing damage to structures. There is yet to be a death at the ski areas from a volcanic event; however the risk at the ski areas is too high to be completely ignored.     The ski areas at Whakapapa and Turoa are currently operated by Ruapehu Alpine Lifts (RAL), who have been significantly improving their commitment to providing volcanic hazard training for their staff and preparing for handling a volcanic eruption. RAL is joined by the Institute of Geological Sciences (GNS) and the Department of Conservation (DoC) in trying to mitigate this risk through  a range of initiatives, including an automated Eruption Detection System (EDS), linked to sirens and loudspeakers on Whakapapa ski areas, as well as by providing staff training and public education.     The aim of this study was to provide RAL with recommendations to improve their staff training and warning system response. Staff induction week at both Turoa and Whakapapa ski areas was observed. Surveys were distributed and collected from staff at both ski areas, and interviews were conducted with staff at Whakapapa ski area. Data obtained from staff interviews and surveys provided the author with insight into staff's mental models regarding a volcanic event response. A simulation of the warning system was observed, as well as a blind test, to collect data on the effectiveness of training on staff response.    Results indicated permanent and seasonal staff were knowledgeable of the volcanic hazards that may affect the ski areas, but had differing perspectives on the risk associated with those hazards. They were found to be confident in the initial response to a volcanic event (i.e. move to higher ground), but were unsure of what would happen after this initial response. RAL was also found to have greatly improved their volcanic hazard training in the past year, however further recommendations were suggested to increase training effectiveness. A training needs analysis was done for different departments at the ski areas by taking a new approach of anticipating demands staff may encounter during a volcanic event and complementing these demands with existing staff competencies. Additional recommendations were made to assist RAL in developing an effective plan to use when responding to volcanic events, as well as other changes that could be made to improve the likelihood of customer safety at the ski areas during an eruption.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ruapehu</field><field name="subject">skiing</field><field name="subject">volcanic hazards</field><field name="subject">lahars</field><field name="subject">emergency management</field><field name="subject">risk perception</field><field name="subject">eruption response plan</field><field name="subject">evacuation</field><field name="subject">training needs analysis</field><field name="subject">mental models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Inhibitors of the Shikimate Pathway Enzyme 3-Dehydroquinate Dehydratase</field><field name="creator">Gower, Mary Amanda</field><field name="description">The shikimate pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of essential aromatic metabolites and, as such, its enzymes are targets for the design of potential antimicrobial and herbicidal agents.  The enzyme 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (dehydroquinase, DHQase) catalyses the conversion of 3-dehydroquinate to 3-dehydroshikimate, the third step of the shikimate pathway.  There are two types of DHQase, unrelated structurally and mechanistically.  Type I DHQase catalyses the rection by via a covalently attached imine intermediate.  Type II DHQase catalyses the reaction by way of an enolate intermediate.    This thesis describes the synthesis of a series of potential inhibitors of type II DHQase.  Inhibitors with C and N at C-3 and with both sp2 and sp3 character at this position were prepared.  A potential type I DHQase inhibitor was also prepared.    The biological evaluation of these inhibitors against type II DHQases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptomyces coelicolor and type I DHQase from Salmonella typhi is described.  Inhibitors were evaluated by spectrophotometric assay.  However, this proved inappropriate for some inhibitors with the S. coelicolor enzyme.  The development of an alternative 1H NMR assay and its application to the evaluation of S. coelicolor DHQase inhibitors is therefore also described.  Some insights into the structure activity relationships of type II DHQases, obtained from the results of these studies, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shikimate pathway</field><field name="subject">dehydroquinase</field><field name="subject">dehydroquinase inhibitors</field><field name="subject">biological evaluation</field><field name="subject">NMR assay</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Higher Dimensional Gravity, Black Holes and Brane  Worlds</field><field name="creator">Carter, Benedict Miles Nicholas</field><field name="description">Current research is focussed on extending our knowledge of how gravity behaves on small scales and near black hole horizons, with various modifications which may probe the low energy limits of quantum gravity. This thesis is concerned with such modifications to gravity and their implications.  In chapter two thermodynamical stability analyses are performed on higher dimensional Kerr anti de Sitter black holes. We find conditions for the black holes to be able to be in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and for the background to be stable against classical tensor perturbations.  In chapter three new spherically symmetric gravastar solutions, stable to radial perturbations, are found by utilising the construction of Visser and Wiltshire. The solutions possess an anti de Sitter or de Sitter interior and a Schwarzschild (anti) de Sitter or Reissner Nordstrom exterior. We find a wide range of parameters which allow stable gravastar solutions, and present the different qualitative behaviors of the equation of state for these parameters.  In chapter four a six dimensional warped brane world compactification of the Salam-Sezgin supergravity model is constructed by generalizing an earlier hybrid Kaluza Klein / Randall Sundrum construction. We demonstrate that the model reproduces localized gravity on the brane in the expected form of a Newtonian potential with Yukawa type corrections. We show that allowed parameter ranges include values which potentially solve the hierarchy problem. The class of solutions given applies to Ricci flat geometries in four dimensions, and consequently includes brane world realisations of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes as particular examples. Arguments are given which suggest that the hybrid compactification of the Salam Sezgin model can be extended to reductions to arbitrary Einstein space geometries in four dimensions.  This work furthers our understanding of higher dimensional general relativity, which is potentially interesting given the possibility that higher dimensions may become observable at the TeV scale, which will be probed in the Large Hadron Collider in the next few years.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black hole</field><field name="subject">kerr</field><field name="subject">de-sitter</field><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">general relativity</field><field name="subject">brane world</field><field name="subject">higher dimension</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demand for Rail: transport options for the Waimakariri District</field><field name="creator">Versteeg, Luke Oscar</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to investigate the feasibility of a passenger rail service operating on a current rail line in Canterbury, known as the Main North Line, which connects the Waimakariri District to Christchurch. The Main North Line runs through the two main urban areas of the Waimakariri District: Rangiora and Kaiapoi. The need for research into the potential use of the Main North Line for passenger services has arisen due to increasing car congestion on arterial roads between the Waimakariri District and Christchurch. All traffic coming from the Waimakariri District into Christchurch must cross the Waimakariri River, creating a transport bottleneck. An assessment of the location of the Main North Line was conducted with respect to the travel needs of Waimakariri District residents using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate how far residents live and work from the line and resident surveys to determine whether people would use rail as their main mode of travel into Christchurch. Assessment of the infrastructure was with regard to the locations of potential railways stations and the capabilities of the infrastructure for supporting different levels of passenger service. National and regional transport strategies are placing more importance on the transportation of people and freight by way of rail. A potential rail service for Canterbury will therefore likely include national and regional stakeholders in co-operation with a private service operator, as currently occurs in Wellington and Auckland. An average of 71% of Waimakariri District residents stated they would switch to rail as their main mode of transport for the journey into Christchurch. GIS analysis found that the number of journeys which start in the Waimakariri District and terminate within 1km of Christchurch stations is around 610 which increases to around 4,300 if connecting bus services were utilised in Christchurch.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rail</field><field name="subject">public transport</field><field name="subject">passenger services</field><field name="subject">Waimakariri District</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Mesoscale Meteorological Models  to Assess Wind Energy Potential</field><field name="creator">Green, Michael Paul</field><field name="description">As the demand for safe and clean electricity increases, the New Zealand wind energy industry seems poised to expand. Many generating companies have projects in the planning stage and there are likely to be many more potential sites yet to be identified. Reliable wind climate predictions over a wide area and for different heights above grounds are often vital to determine the viability of wind farm projects. This study investigates the use of meteorological mesoscale models to determine the wind and energy resource, particularly in areas of complex terrain. Complex terrain environments are likely to be typical of where New Zealand wind energy developments will take place. Using the prognostic mesoscale meteorological model TAPM (The Air Pollution Model), regions of relatively high mean wind speed were identified for a number of regions, including Banks Peninsula and parts of Canterbury and Otago. The simulations were conducted for a one-year period (2001) and at different heights above ground level. Depending on the resolution of the model calculations, speed-up effects from the forcing of some topographic features were accounted for by this model. Where the modelling was considered reliable, hourly wind data were obtained from grid points within the inner grid and used as input data for the industry-standard wind energy assessment model WAsP (The Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program). As WAsP is able to account for detailed topography and surface roughness features, wind and energy predictions at a specific site or over a wider area surrounding the site were made. Limitations of both models in complex terrain were identified. These limitations were due to a number of factors, including the grid spacing used for mesoscale model calculations, the complexity of the terrain, and difficulties in modelling some regional scale airflow regimes. Being aware of when and where model limitations are likely to occur is important in being able to overcome and account for them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="subject">mesoscale models</field><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the spatial distribution of stoats, ship rats and weasels in a beech forest setting using GIS</field><field name="creator">Lough, Hamish</field><field name="description">Using trap data the Hawdon, Poulter and South Branch valleys, a spatial distribution model was created for Stoats (Mustela erminea), Ship Rats (Rattus rattus) and Weasels (Mustela nivalis) in the North Branch of the Hurunui River. Ten spatial attributes were analysed in this thesis as potential spatial predictors of Stoats, Ship rats or Weasels; four of which were distance related measurements (distance from ecotonal edge, distance from river, distance from river tributary and distance from trapping edge); three were climate based variables (mean maximum temperature, mean minimum temperature and mean precipitation) and three were topographical based variables (elevation, aspect and slope). Relationships that existed between each spatial attribute and the number of Stoats, Ship Rats and Weasels caught were quantified by comparing the significance of the mean trapping rate with each spatial attribute and expressed spatially as maps in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Results from this thesis found elevation, aspect and distance from ecotonal edge as potential spatial predictors of Stoat populations. Elevation and aspect were found to be potential predictors of Ship rat and Weasel populations. GIS is able to predict the spatial distribution of pest species to a similar (or better) level compared to more formal associative models. The potential of GIS is however, restrained by the same limitations associated with these models. By using a larger trapping data set and identifying a number of social interactions between Stoats, Ship Rats and Weasels, one can improve the accuracy of spatially modelling each species within a Beech forest environment. Therefore, improve our understanding how landscapes influence the distribution of each pest species.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Conservation</field><field name="subject">Stoat distribution</field><field name="subject">Ship Rat distribution</field><field name="subject">Weasel distribution</field><field name="subject">distribution maps</field><field name="subject">Operation Ark</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">Ecological modelling</field><field name="subject">Hawdon valley</field><field name="subject">Poulter valley</field><field name="subject">South Branch</field><field name="subject">North Branch</field><field name="subject">Hurunui Mainland Island</field><field name="subject">Nothofagus</field><field name="subject">beech forest.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'An island story'?

Gaines</field><field name="description">The past twenty years of research that has associated air pollution with health outcomes has brought remarkable advance in statistical techniques that effectively tease out the intricacies of the relationship. However, while statistical techniques progressed, an assumption based on seminal work in the field persisted: that concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution are spatially homogeneous within urban areas, and consequently, that personal exposures could be based on central monitoring site data alone. Although this assumption went unaddressed for years, it has now come to researchers' attention that it may be flawed and that the assumption may induce exposure misclassification error under certain conditions. This thesis explores intraurban spatial variability in PM through a systematic review of the literature, experimental field testing, modelling, and new methodological approaches. The key outcomes of the thesis are as follows: (i) the publication of the first systematic review of the intraurban particulate literature, challenging the widely-held assumption that PM concentrations are spatially uniform; (ii) an experimental test was conducted in Christchurch, New Zealand, revealing that the homogenous assumption was false for a city with high wintertime particulate matter concentrations; (iii) an integrated meteorological-emission model was evaluated for the first time at the intraurban level for PM and a new study design was suggested; and (iv) the spatial modification effect of social and ecological confounders was analysed with respect to respiratory hospital admissions and PM. Collectively, these outcomes provide a new body of knowledge informing researchers focused on assessing the relationship between air pollution and health in applications ranging from small-area exposure assessment to the wider field of environmental epidemiology.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial epidemiology</field><field name="subject">air pollution</field><field name="subject">environmental epidemiology</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Christchurch</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of integrin-like proteins, tyrosine phosphorylation and F-actin in hyphal tip growth</field><field name="creator">Chitcholtan, Kanueng</field><field name="description">Tip growth, the mechanism by which hyphae, pollen tubes, root hairs, and algal rhizoids extend, is a complex and dynamic process that is characterised by localised extension at the extreme apex of the cell and morphological polarity. Its complexity suggests that high degree of regulation is needed to ensure that the characteristics of a particular cell type are maintained during growth. Regulation is likely to come about through bidirectional interplay between the cell wall and cytoplasm, although the mechanisms by which such cross-talk might occur are unknown. Results of this thesis present immunocytochemical data that indicate the presence of, and a close association between &#946;4 integrin subunit-like proteins and proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the oomycete Achlya bisexualis. When hyphae were plasmolysed, these proteins were present in wall-membrane attachment sites where there was also F-actin. A combination of immunoblots, ELISA, and a coupled enzyme assay suggest that phosphorylation may occur by both autophosphorylation and through the possible action of a tyrosine kinase. Tyrphostins, which are inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, abolished the anti-phosphotyrosine staining, inhibited the kinase activity, slowed tip growth and affected the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, results show A. bisexualis contains proteins epitopically similar to the rod domain of animal talin. However, these proteins do not co-localise with F-actin, and mainly locate at the sub-apical region in hyphae. For comparative purposes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was also used to investigate the presence of &#946;4 integrin subunit-like proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation.  Immunoblotting showed that S. cereviaise contains a protein, which is found in the microsomal pellet fraction, that cross reacts with anti-&#946;4 integrin subunit antibody. Furthermore, there are a number of proteins containing phosphotyrosine residues. Immunocytochemistry shows that this anti-&#946;4 integrin staining is at the cortical site but anti-phosphotyrosine residues are distributed throughout cells. On the basis of an ELISA and a coupled enzyme assay, it is suggested that a soluble fraction of S. cerevisiae contains tyrosine kinase activity. This activity is strongly inhibited by tyrphostins.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrin</field><field name="subject">tip growth</field><field name="subject">tyrosine phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">Achlya bisexualis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide signalling in the basolateral complex of the amygdala: an extension of NMDA receptor activation during Pavlovian fear conditioning and expression</field><field name="creator">Overeem, Kathie</field><field name="description">N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptors located within the basolateral complex of the amygdala are required for the consolidation and expression of Pavlovian conditioned fear. The events downstream of receptor activation that mediate these processes are not well defined. An intermediate step that may be of significance is the synthesis of the gas nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide is synthesised as a result of NMDA receptor activation and acts as an unconventional neurotransmitter freely diffusing across cell membranes interacting with its targets in a non-synaptic manner. The targets of NO include cellular components that play significant roles during the consolidation of conditioned fear and the neurotransmission associated with its expression. This implies that NO may be an important intermediary of NMDA receptor activation and both these processes. The current study sought to examine this possibility using fear potentiated startle to examine the expression of learned fear. Three experiments were conducted, fifty rats received intra-BSC microinfusions of the global nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME either prior to fear conditioning, fear testing, or examination of the shock sensitization of the acoustic startle affect. The results indicated that NO was indeed required for both the consolidation and expression of learned fear, whereas it was not required for shock enhanced startle responding. This study provides new information about the sub-cellular basis of conditioned fear, and highlights the pivotal role played by NO in processes associated with conditioned fear.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">Pavlovian Fear conditioning</field><field name="subject">Fear expression</field><field name="subject">Shock sensitisation of the acoustic startle</field><field name="subject">Amygdala</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scintillator wavelength influence in an optical dosimeter</field><field name="creator">Chen, Tom (Chien-Sheng)</field><field name="description">Green and red scintillator crystals with plastic fiber optics were used to investigate their application as optical fiber dosimeters.

In Part 2, we changed the field to X=1cm, Y1=5cm and Y2=1cm. The SOBR for red and green with no filter are 44.43 and 45.47. After we added the filter, the SOBR for red and green became 15.62 and 1684. This change in field shape gave us a higher SOBR, especially when the filter was added. In Part 3, we tested the angular response of our detector. Both systems increased their response when gantry angle reach 45&#176; and -45&#176; (315&#176;). When the filter was added, a change of a factor of 2 in response remained. When the crystal was then rotated and pointed in the direction of the gantry, good response was obtained from range 90&#176; to -90&#176; (270&#176;). The response of green system was within 2.5%. For the red system, a large step about 10% was observed. Conversion of the fiber fluorescence and Cerenkov radiation in the scintillator crystal and transmission to the detector is a problem in all optical fiber systems, including the dual fiber system, that remains to be addressed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scintillator Dosimeter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic and kinetic investigations into living free-radical polymerisation used in the preparation of polymer therapeutics</field><field name="creator">Adash, Uma</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to successfully prepare polymers of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide, (PHPMA) using controlled/"living" free-radical polymerisation technique. For this purpose, atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) and reversible addition-fragmentation (chain) transfer (RAFT) polymerisation were used in preparation of a number of base polymers with the intention of quantitatively converting them into PHPMA. Both methods were applied under varying polymerisation conditions, and the kinetics of the systems investigated. Various rate constants were measured, while computer modelling of the experimental data allowed estimation of other kinetic parameters of interest. Investigations into solvent and ligand effects on the kinetics of ATRP of the activated ester methacryloyloxy succinimide (MAOS) and one of the archetypal methacrylate monomers, methyl methacrylate (MMA) were carried out. The method of RAFT was also employed in polymerisation of MAOS and a number of other monomers in the hope of finding the best synthetic precursor of PHPMA. Polymers of methacryloyl chloride (MAC) and p-nitrophenyl methacrylate (NPMA) were prepared, as well as the polymers of HPMA itself and N-isopropyl methacrylamide. Polymerisation of MMA by RAFT was also attempted in view of adding to current knowledge on the monomer's behaviour and the kinetic characteristics of its RAFT polymerisation. Preparation of PHPMA from PMAOS, PMAC and PNPMA was attempted. Successful preparation of PHPMA from the polymer of the acid chloride was achieved under mild reaction conditions, while displacement of N-hydroxysuccinimide groups of PMAOS resulted in unexpected modification of the polymer under the conditions used. Conversion of PNPMA into PHPMA was not achieved. At this stage these results suggest inadequacy of both PMAOS and PNPMA as reactive polymeric precursors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">living free-radical polymerisation</field><field name="subject">atom transfer radical polymerisation</field><field name="subject">reversible addition-fragmentation (chain) transfer polymerisation</field><field name="subject">polymer therapeutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digging the dirt on density: a study of medium density housing in Christchurch's Living Three zone</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">Since the 1987 Brundtland Report, the development of urban areas has been considered a key  determinant in achieving 'sustainability'. Greater residential density is increasingly advocated  for and applied through policy statements around the world as a way of achieving this goal.  Various tiers of New Zealand government are following international policy trends,  developing programmes, protocols and strategies that promote sustainability and 'good' urban  design practices through intensification, or concentration, within urban areas. Research shows  that a policy framework of urban concentration, through greater residential density, is only  successful where consumers and providers of housing support its practical application.  Confrontation between policy and the market, and the acceptability of greater levels of  residential density to residents, can jeopardise a policy's success.  This research uses a mix of survey and interview techniques to determine the acceptability of  "medium density" developments to residents, and to understand the practises and motivations  of housing developers in Christchurch's "Living 3" zone. This zone is predominantly sited  between the central business district and low-density suburban areas, making it ideally located  to facilitate policies of intensification. The principle purpose of the zone is the development  of medium-density residential accommodation, however greater residential density is  relatively new to Christchurch where the potential for expansion is seemingly unbounded.  The intention of this research is to assist the planning, production and performance of future  developments. In conclusion, this thesis makes recommendations to improve the form and  design of medium density residential developments in Christchurch's inner Living Three zone  in terms of the market's producers and consumers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">brundtland report</field><field name="subject">residential density</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to Photoactivated Cytotoxins</field><field name="creator">Zibaseresht, Ramin</field><field name="description">The synthesis and coordination chemistry of eleven bridging ligands, eight of which are new compounds, are described. These ligands are all based on the tridentate terpyridyl system. The other metal ion binding sites of these ligands contain pyridine/bipyridine/pyrazole rings or amine/azamacrocycles domains. In these ligands, the two metal ion binding sites are differentiated by the number of atoms in each site, the configuration of the binding site or the types of donor atom that are present. This binding site differentiation allows to use the different coordination properties of the binding sites to control the regiochemistry of the complexation, ensuring that the correct metal ion is incorporated at the correct binding site in the ligand. Many of the complexes synthesised are mono-ruthenium(II) complexes where Ru(II) ions are situated in the terpyridyl sites of the ligands. These include heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes of the type [Ru(ttp)(L)]2+, where ttp is 4'-(p-tolyl)-2,2':6',2&#698;- terpyridine, and L is the bridging ligand. Reactions of the Ru(II) complexes with a range of metal ions including Co(III) ion have been investigated. The Ru(II) complexes can be classified into three main categories depending on the type of ligands that have been employed: (1) Ru(II) complexes which can react with Co(III) ions to form heterodinuclear Ru(II)-Co(III) complexes; (2) Ru(II) complexes which react only with Ag(I) ions and no other common metal ions that we have tried; (3) Ru(II) complexes with no detectable ability to coordinate other common metal ions. Following standard cobalt chemistry, some heterodinuclear Ru(II)-Co(III) complexes of the type [(ttp)Ru(cymt)Co(X)2]3+, where X = NO2 -, Cl-, and OH-, have been successfully prepared from the corresponding Ru(II) complexes. In these heterodinuclear complexes, anions such as NO2 -, Cl-, or OH- can be readily attached to the Co(III) ions. However, attachment of a neutral species such as en ligands to the Co(III) ions in the complexes proved to be more difficult. Reactions of heterodinuclear Ru(II)-Co(III) complexes with en ligands result in removal of the cobalt ions from the complexes. This is may be a result of a significant difference in the overall charges between the complexes with anionic and the complexes with neutral ligands (3+ vs 5+). Higher overall charge of the complexes when protonable ligands such as monodentate en are present, may destabilize the complexes even more. A combination of NMR spectroscopy, ESI-MS, UV-vis spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography has been used to characterise the ligands and their complexes. The crystal structures of one new ligand and sixteen complexes are described.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ruthenium complexes</field><field name="subject">Cobalt complexes</field><field name="subject">Coordination chemistry</field><field name="subject">Heterodinuclear complexes</field><field name="subject">X-ray crystallography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gastrointestinal Physiology of Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum) with Gastric Dilation Air Sacculitis (GDAS)</field><field name="creator">Forgan, Leonard George</field><field name="description">The syndrome known as Gastric Dilation Air Sacculitis (GDAS) has recently been described by Lumsden et al. (2002) for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Walbaum), in seawater (SW) culture in New Zealand. The syndrome is characterised by distended abdomens, gastric dilation and air sacculitis, increased feed conversion ratios (FCR) and mortality. Consequently, financial returns on affected stocks are greatly reduced. A study into the epidemiology and physiology of the syndrome was initiated, working with the major aquaculture company, The New Zealand King Salmon Company (NZKS). The study revealed causative factors of GDAS. GDAS was experimentally induced only in saltwater by feeding a commercially manufactured low-cohesion pelleted diet. Control groups were fed a different diet with high physical cohesion. Low-cohesion pellets have previously been associated with a high incidence of GDAS in commercial sea cages. These data implicated osmoregulatory stress and physical properties of the feed in GDAS development. In addition, gastrointestinal (GI) physiology in GDAS -affected and -control fish was characterised. The process of GDAS development in O. tshawytscha is characterised by a loss of smooth muscle tone of the stomach as it distends.  Laplace's law (P= 2T/r, where P is the distending pressure, T is the tension in the wall and r is the radius of the cylinder) predicts that unless muscle mass increases, the ability of the stomach wall to contract will be lost and consequently a loss of GI motor function will result. Therefore, GI circular smooth muscle integrity in terms of (1) stimulated and maximal contractility, (2) osmoregulatory ability of the intestine and the (3) control of the GI system was studied in pathologically affected (+ve) and unaffected (-ve) smolt. Affected fish showed changes in GI circular smooth muscle function and osmoregulatory dysfunction. Feeding different diets induced distinct gastric evacuation patterns. The intestinal brake hypothesis is presented and argued to be the probable mechanism for GDAS development. GDAS (+ve) serum showed the presence of factors capable of contracting gut smooth muscle. In addition, potential humoral mediators of the intestinal brake in fish were investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinook</field><field name="subject">Salmon</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal</field><field name="subject">GDAS</field><field name="subject">Osmoregulation</field><field name="subject">Smooth Muscle</field><field name="subject">CCK</field><field name="subject">Gastrin</field><field name="subject">GLP-1</field><field name="subject">5HT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of encoding and retrieval  processes in children's false memories in the  DRM paradigm.</field><field name="creator">Blakeley, Marissa</field><field name="description">Furthering our understanding of children's memory mechanisms will expand our knowledge  of ways to reduce false memory errors. Hege and Dodson (2004) found that adult participants  who studied pictures later recalled items more accurately than participants who studied words.  This demonstrated that encoding information in a distinctive manner can reduce false  memories. The main aim of the present study was to explore whether using distinctive  information within the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm can reduce false memories in  children (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). Two hundred and forty-three eleven year-old children (mean age 11.5) studied pictures and words on a screen, each with an  accompanying aural label. In contrast to the findings of Hege and Dodson, studying pictures  did not reduce false memories in these participants. There were no significant encoding differences between children who studied pictures and children who studied words, as  measured by the rate of falsely recalled non-presented critical lure words. Moreover, the  children's average rate of recall of the false memories was very low (19.6%). This is just over  half the rate reported by Hege and Dodson with adult subjects. On the other hand,  manipulation of the test instructions at retrieval had a significant effect on the rate of recall of  critical lures. Each group of participants received different retrieval instructions. As expected,  the highest numbers of recalled critical lures occurred when subjects were asked to report  studied items as well as related items (inclusion recall instructions). This study demonstrated  the complex role of encoding and retrieval mechanisms in older children's memory processes,  and showed that children do not appear to reduce false memories in a manner that is  consistent with adults. The results are discussed in terms of children's processing of pictures  and words, eleven-year-olds' semantic development, and links to fuzzy-trace theory.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">false memories</field><field name="subject">reducing false memories</field><field name="subject">false memories in children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photoinhibition under drought and high light loads in New Zealand's divaricate shrubs</field><field name="creator">Schneiderheinze, Jenny</field><field name="description">A question that has plagued New Zealand botanists for many years is the occurrence of the divaricate growth form in several different plant families, and what selection pressure could have led to such parallel evolution. One prominent theory is that the divaricate habit is an adaptation to climatic extremes. This study aims to test if the 'self-shading' growth form of divaricates protects their internal leaves from photoinhibition under physiological drought and high irradiance. By being able to forego the costs of maintaining photoprotective mechanisms, they should have greater carbon gain than their non-divaricate congeners under these conditions.  To test if divaricates are protected from the detrimental effects of photoinhibition, the water potentials, pigment and vitamin E concentrations, and photosynthetic rates of two divaricates species in their natural habitat were measured. Additionally, these parameters were recorded for the same divaricate species and their non-divaricate congeners under glasshouse conditions. In the field there were clear differences in several key parameters between divaricates under different levels of irradiance and water availability, and in most cases there was clear evidence of photoinbition. In the glasshouse, the maximum photosynthetic rates were significantly higher in divaricate leaves than in non-divaricate leaves, but there were no clear differences in the avoidance of photoinhibition between divaricates and non-divaricates. Interestingly, more pronounced responses to the different treatments were observed between genera than between the growth forms in the field and glasshouse experiments.  The presence of photoinhibition and photoprotective mechanisms in divaricate leaves does not support the theory that the divaricate habit evolved as a physiological response to extreme climate conditions. The absence of a strong difference in the amount of photoinhibition between divariacte and non-divaricate congeners mean that high irradiance and drought stress are unlikely to have been a key factor in the evolution of the divaricate habit. That the within genus physiologies are more similar than within the growth forms would indicate that the divaricate habit possibly evolved after the evolution of the physiological responses of the genera.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant families</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">habit</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">divaricate</field><field name="subject">shrubs</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of F-actin in Hyphal Branching</field><field name="creator">McNaughton, Fergus Samuel</field><field name="description">Hyphal organisms are a commonly used model system for studies of polarised growth. While growing hyphal tips offer a good example of polarised growth, little detail of the process of polarisation can be determined from them. Hyphal branching offers a good example of the development of polarity, however to date it has been largely impractical to study hyphal branching, due to the irregular timing and location along the hypha of natural branch formation. Chemical induction of branches circumnavigates this problem, using a localised concentration of nutrients adjacent to the growing hypha to stimulate controlled branching.    Using previous studies of hyphal branching combined with the current understanding of hyphal tip growth, a model of the branching process was established (Jackson et al. 2001). Reception of a branching cue leads to the formation of a radial F-actin array at the new branch site. This, by means of either delivery of cell wall softening enzymes or direct mechanical pressure, leads in turn to the emergence of a visible bump in the hyphal wall. This bump enlarges and then progresses into the branch proper. The bump stage of the branching process is perhaps the least understood, with existing studies giving detail of pre- and post-bump events. The research described in this thesis suggests that bump emergence is a two stage process; an early bump stage, where localised cell wall softening leads to turgor pressure in the cell pushing out the bump, and a late bump, where F-actin is arranged into the developing branch. The addition of an F-actin inhibitor to the induction solution confirmed that the early bump stage is relatively independent of the F-actin cytoskeleton, however this experiment was unable to test F-actin's role in full branch development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hyphal branching</field><field name="subject">F-actin</field><field name="subject">cytoskeleton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Braided river springs: distribution, benthic ecology, and role in the landscape</field><field name="creator">Gray, Duncan Peter</field><field name="description">Alluvial springs are an interesting feature of braided river flood plains.  The aim of this study was to quantify and characterise the fauna and physicochemistry of these springs.  The distribution and occurrence of springs was assessed using a GIS analysis in 20 South Island braided rivers. The greatest number of springs was found in east coast inter-montane valleys, 65% of which were associated with obstructions in the river valley, such as alluvial fans, bluffs or flood retention works.    A comparison between springs, hill slope streams and main channels in the upper Waimakariri River revealed physically disparate environments, which were reflected by their invertebrate communities.  Springs contained the greatest number of unique taxa, which was attributed to high stability and the presence of phreatic taxa.  In spring-sources the presence of aquatic plants were found to be a powerful structuring influence on benthic invertebrate communities. The generalist, asynchronous nature of New Zealand benthic invertebrate fauna, and the high diversity and evenness of predatory taxa are also thought to be influential on the high levels of taxonomic richness at spring-sources.  Away from the spring-source taxonomic richness decreased due to the decline in stability and habitat complexity.    Spring age, or time since major disturbance, was important in structuring benthic invertebrate communities.  Older springs were dominated by non-insect taxa, whereas younger springs, were dominated by insects which are rapid dispersers.  A macrophyte manipulation experiment was conducted in four spring-sources.  The removal of macrophytes from treatment plots resulted in a decrease in taxa abundance, but an increase in evenness.  Mayflies and caddisflies increased, replacing mollusca and diptera.  This shift in community composition may have been due to changes in available living space, food resources, flow characteristics and physical structure between the cobble and macrophyte habitats.  Springs contributed a major proportion of the benthic invertebrate biodiversity to the upper Waimakariri River and this study confirms that they deserve commensurate consideration in regional river management planning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">springs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of the type ii intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction directed toward natural product synthesis</field><field name="creator">Muscroft-Taylor, Andrew Clive</field><field name="description">This thesis describes synthetic studies directed towards the total synthesis of the nakafuran and florlide marine natural products. Chapter One provides an overview of the importance of natural products to current medicinal chemistry and describes how the "supply issue" associated with these biologically derived compounds can be resolved through the process of total synthesis. Two families of marine natural products, the nakafurans and the florlides, are introduced as synthetic targets and strategies utilising a type II intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) reaction to achieve their total synthesis are delineated. The efficient preparation of regio- and stereodefined vinyl coupling fragments via hydrostannylation and hydrohalogenation methodology is described in Chapter Two. The palladium-catalysed cross-coupling of these fragments, via Stille or Negishi coupling methodology, yielded dienes which were successfully advanced to IMDA triene precursors. Chapter Three describes investigation of the type II IMDA reaction to give bicyclo[4.3.1]decene carbocyclic skeletons. A facile acid-catalysed 6,7-alkene to 7,8-alkene olefinic isomerisation, via a proposed oxonium intermediate, and the inability to appropriately functionalise the desired adducts impeded progress along the synthetic route. Molecular modelling was conducted to investigate the causes of this unexpected reactivity. Investigations in Chapter Four describe the successful synthesis and cyclisation of homomethyl triene analogues prepared via application of enyne metathesis chemistry. The use of an exo-cyclopropylcarbinyl fragmentation was found to be unsuccessful as a means of installing the desired 6-methyl-bicyclo[4.3.1]decan-2-one core with a competing endo-ring expansion giving rise to a bicyclo[4.4.1]undecane ring system.

Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is the predominant base drug in most herbal highs. The limited research into BZP has suggested that it produces similar effects to amphetamine, but could be 10 times less potent. There are to date, however, no long-term behavioural studies of BZP exposure. This study therefore, investigated effects of BZP exposure in adolescent male and female rats on subsequent measures of anxiety-like behaviours in adulthood. One group of experimental animals was treated daily with BZP, whereas another group received the same total amount of drug via a four day "binge" regime.  The results suggested that, when observed in a Y-maze, social interaction test and a light/dark emergence test, BZP-treated rats were more anxious than control animals. In the Y-maze, male controls were more active than female controls, but BZP-treated females were more active than treated males.  Results of this interaction indicate that the male rats may have been more affected by the administration of BZP during adolescence than females.  Additionally, rats given the binge dose regime showed significantly increased anxiety in the Y-maze relative to the daily-exposed or control rats'. This suggests that larger quantities of BZP over a shorter time frame produce more detrimental effects than smaller quantities of BZP over a longer time frame. Overall, it would appear that the administration of BZP to adolescent animals produces behavioural changes in emotionality that are detectable in adulthood.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">benzylpiperazine</field><field name="subject">drug</field><field name="subject">developmental</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phonological representations, phonological awareness, and print decoding ability in children with moderate to severe speech impairment</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Dean Edward</field><field name="description">The development of reading competency is one of the most significant pedagogical achievements during the first few years of schooling. Although most children learn to read successfully when exposed to reading instruction, up to 18% of children experience significant reading difficulty  (Shaywitz, 1998). As a group, young children with speech impairment are at risk of reading impairment, with approximately 50% of these children demonstrating poor acquisition of early reading skills (Nathan, Stackhouse, Goulandris, &amp; Snowling, 2004; Larivee &amp; Catts, 1999). A number of variables contribute to reading outcomes for children with speech impairment including co-occurring language impairment, the nature and severity of their speech impairment as well as social and cultural influences. An area of research that has received increasing attention is understanding how access to the underlying sound structure or phonological representations of spoken words stored in long-term memory account for reading difficulties observed in children (Elbro, 1996; Fowler, 1991). Researchers have hypothesised that children with speech impairment may be at increased risk of reading disability due to deficits at the level of phonological representations (Bird, Bishop, &amp; Freeman, 1995).   Phonological representation deficits can manifest in poor performance on tasks that require children to think about the sound structure of words. Knowledge about the phonological components of words is commonly referred to as phonological awareness. Identifying and manipulating phonemes within words are examples of phonological awareness skills. Some children with speech impairment perform poorly on phonological awareness measures compared to children without speech difficulties (Bird et al., 1995; Carroll &amp; Snowling, 2004; Rvachew, Ohberg, Grawburg, &amp; Heyding, 2003). As performance on phonological awareness tasks is a strong predictor of early reading ability (Hogan, Catts, &amp; Little, 2005), there is an important need to determine if children with speech impairment who demonstrate poor phonological awareness, have deficits at the level of phonological representations. This thesis reports a series of studies that investigated the relationship between phonological representations, phonological awareness, and word decoding ability in children with moderate to severe speech impairment. A child with complex communication needs (CCN) who used Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) was also examined to determine how the absence of effective articulation skills influences the development of phonological representations.  The study employed a longitudinal design to compare the performance of nine children (aged 3:09-5:03 at initial assessment) with moderate to severe speech impairment and 17 children with typical speech development on novel assessment measures designed to determine characteristics of children's phonological representations. The tasks required children to judge the accuracy of spoken multisyllable words and newly learned nonwords. The relationships between performance on these tasks and measures of speech, phonological awareness and early print decoding were also examined. Four assessment trials were implemented at six-monthly intervals over an 18-month period. The first assessment trial was administered approximately 6 to12 months before children commenced school. The fourth trial was administered after children had completed 6 to 12 months of formal education. The child with CCN completed three assessment trials over a period of 16 months.  Data analyses revealed that the children with speech impairment had significantly greater difficulty (p&lt;0.01) judging mispronounced multisyllable words compared to their peers with typical speech development. As a group, children with speech impairment also demonstrated inferior performance on the judgment of mispronounced forms of newly learned nonwords (p&lt;0.05). No group differences were observed on the judgment of correctly pronounced real and nonword stimuli.  Significant group differences on speech production and phoneme segmentation tasks were identified at each assessment trial. Moderate to high correlations (i.e., r = 0.40 to 0.70) were also observed between performance on the phonological representation tasks and performance on phonological awareness and speech production measures at each trial across the study. Although no significant group differences were observed on the nonword decoding task, 4 of the 9 children with speech impairment could not decode any letters in nonwords (compared to only 1 child without speech impairment) at the final assessment trial when children were 6-years-old. Two children with speech impairment showed superior nonword decoding ability at trial 3 and 4.  The within-group variability observed on the nonword decoding task highlighted the heterogeneity of children with speech impairment. The performances of four children with speech impairment with differing types of speech error patterns were analysed to investigate the role of phonological representations in their speech and phonological awareness development. The child with delayed speech development and excellent phonological awareness at trial 1, demonstrated superior phonological awareness and word decoding skills at age 6 years, although his performance on phonological representation tasks was inconsistent across trials. In contrast, a child with delayed development and poor early phonological awareness demonstrated weak performance on phonological representation, phonological awareness, and decoding at each successive assessment trial. The child with a high percentage of inconsistent speech error patterns generally demonstrated poor performance on phonological representation, phonological awareness and decoding measures at each of the 4 assessment trials. The child with consistent and unusual speech error patterns showed increasingly stronger performance on the phonological representation tasks and average performance on phonological awareness but limited word decoding ability at age 6. The 11-year-old girl with CCN, whose speech attempts were limited and unintelligible, demonstrated below average performance on phonological representation tasks, suggesting that an absence of articulatory feedback may negatively influence the development of well-specified phonological representations.   This thesis provides evidence for the use of receptive tasks to identify differences in the phonological representations of children with and without speech impairment. The findings also provide support for the link between the representation of phonological information in long-term memory and children's speech production accuracy, phonological awareness and print decoding ability. The variable performance of some children with speech impairment and the child with cerebral palsy demonstrate the need to consider individual characteristics to develop an understanding of how children store and access speech sound information to assist their acquisition of early reading skills.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phonological representations</field><field name="subject">phonological awareness</field><field name="subject">speech impairment</field><field name="subject">print decoding</field><field name="subject">early reading</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological Activity of Steroid Analogues:Synthesis and Receptor/Enzyme Interactions</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Anna Rose</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the biological activity of selected non-steroidal analogues of sex steroid hormones by examining two different effects of analogues on endogenous sex hormone activity.

As the biological activity of steroids is related to their chemical structure, the important features of steroid structure are identified, including the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene nucleus, arrangement of ring substituents and ring junction conformation. The concept of non-steroidal analogues of steroids is introduced, and the harmful or beneficial effects analogues have on endogenous steroid activity are considered. Alteration of steroid activity and its consequences are focussed on two main areas; the potential adverse effects of environmental chemicals which mimic sex steroid activity, and the use of non-steroidal analogues in medicinal chemistry for treating sex steroid related disease. Chapter Two describes an investigation into the 17&#946;-estradiol mimicking activity of non-steroidal analogues. Exogenous chemicals that mimic estradiol are of concern as they may alter endogenous estradiol activity and disrupt endocrine systems. Firstly, an introduction to the field of research concerned with environmental chemicals that mimic steroid hormones is given. The interaction of xenoestrogens with the estrogen receptor is described, as are the methods available for assessing the estrogen mimicking activity of xenoestrogens. The concern for insecticides mimicking estrogen activity is described by reviewing reported activities of insecticides, which leads into a discussion of work carried out as part of this thesis. Metabolites of the pyrethroid insecticides permethrin and cypermethrin, 2.14, 2.15, and 2.16 were synthesised while others were commercially obtained. The interaction of pyrethroid insecticide metabolites with the human estrogen receptor expressed in recombinant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was studied, following the establishment and validation of the assay. Metabolites 2.11, 2.12, and 2.14 were found to weakly stimulate estrogen receptor-mediated estradiol responsive gene expression in the yeast assay (105 less active than 17&#946;-estradiol). Since the activity of the metabolites using the yeast assay was greater than for the parent compounds, metabolic pathways need to be considered when assessing the impact of exposure to environmental estrogens. The low estrogenic activity suggests these compounds are not individually contributing significantly to the xenoestrogenic impact on humans, but will add to total xenoestrogen exposure. Chapter Three describes the inhibition of a sex steroid metabolising enzyme, steroid 5a-reductase, by novel non-steroidal compounds. Inhibitors of this enzyme are potentially useful therapeutic agents for regulating the activity of an androgen in prostate disorders. A review of the literature on non-steroidal inhibition of 5a-reductase identified three key structural features known to enhance inhibitor potency; ring substitution, position and nature of ring unsaturation and angular methyl group presence. These features were taken into account in the design of inhibitors synthesised in this thesis (3.55-3.57, 3.59, 3.61, 3.62, 3.110 and 3.111). Inhibitors consisting of non-steroidal 5- or 1-aryl pyridone scaffolds were synthesised to investigate SAR for 4'-substituents. The 5-aryl 1-methyl-2-pyridone/piperidone scaffold of compounds 3.55-3.57 and 3.59 was constructed by Suzuki cross coupling methodology, while the 1-aryl 2-methyl 2,3-dihydro-4-pyridone scaffold of 3.61 and 3.62 was constructed by aza Diels-Alder methodology. Long carbon chain olefin containing tethers 3.107 and 3.108 were synthesised for conjugation to inhibitor 3.57 by cross metathesis to give conjugates 3.110 and 3.111. Compounds 3.55-3.57, 3.59, 3.61, 3.62, 3.110 and 3.111 inhibited the type 1 5a-reductase isozyme expressed by HEK-I cells, with activities comparable to those of related literature compounds. The 1-aryl 2,3-dihydro-4-pyridone 3.62 inhibited both the type 1 and 2 isozymes (expressed by HEK-II cells) of 5a-reductase. The presence of bulky hydrophobic groups (benzoyl, long chain tethers) at the 4' position enhanced the potency of type 1 inhibition by 5-aryl pyridone type compounds in comparison to N,N-diisopropyl- and N-allylacetamide groups. This information provides further understanding of SAR within and across different classes of non-steroidal inhibitors of steroid 5a-reductase towards improved drug design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">steroids</field><field name="subject">non-steroidal</field><field name="subject">analogues</field><field name="subject">estrogen receptor</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">steroid 5-alpha reductase</field><field name="subject">inhibitors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Suppressing Discretization Error  in Langevin Simulations of  (2+1)-dimensional Field Theories</field><field name="creator">Wojtas, David Heinrich</field><field name="description">Lattice simulations are a popular tool for studying the non-perturbative physics  of nonlinear field theories. To perform accurate lattice simulations, a careful  account of the discretization error is necessary. Spatial discretization error as  a result of lattice spacing dependence in Langevin simulations of anisotropic  (2 + 1)-dimensional classical scalar field theories is studied. A transfer integral  operator (TIO) method and a one-loop renormalization (1LR) procedure are used  to formulate effective potentials. The effective potentials contain counterterms  which are intended to suppress the lattice spacing dependence. The two effective  potentials were tested numerically in the case of a phi-4 model. A high accuracy  modified Euler method was used to evolve a phenomenological Langevin equation.  Large scale Langevin simulations were performed in parameter ranges determined  to be appropriate. Attempts at extracting correlation lengths as a means of  determining effectiveness of each method were not successful. Lattice sizes used  in this study were not of a sufficient size to obtain an accurate representation of  thermal equilibrium. As an alternative, the initial behaviour of the ensemble field  average was observed. Results for the TIO method showed that it was successful  at suppressing lattice spacing dependence in a mean field limit. Results for the  1LR method showed that it performed poorly.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum field theory</field><field name="subject">Langevin simulations</field><field name="subject">transfer matrix</field><field name="subject">discretization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Coordination of Breathing and Swallowing Across the Human Lifespan: Implications for Neural Control</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Bronwen Noreen</field><field name="description">Our understanding of the neural control of breathing-swallowing coordination (BSC) is largely unclear. Although brainstem control is undoubtedly predominant, this research investigated the hypothesis that the cortex becomes increasingly influential in BSC between birth and adulthood. The main paradigm used to test this primary hypothesis was a comparison of BSC in conditions along a continuum of volitional through non-volitional swallowing on the basis of a decreasing level of cortical activation along this continuum. Voluntarily-initiated swallows during wakefulness were at one end of the continuum and reflexively-initiated swallows during sleep were at the other extreme. Non-volitional wakeful swallows were considered between these two conditions. The BSC of ten infants between birth and 1 year of age and twenty adults between the ages of 20 and 75 years was recorded using non-invasive time-locked recording methods. In order to apply the 'continuum-of-volition' paradigm to swallowing conditions in infants, BSC was monitored during nutritive (breast- or bottle-feeding), non-nutritive wake, and sleep swallows. Infants were monitored longitudinally to determine whether maturation of the cortex and corticobulbar tracts during the first year of life influenced the patterns of BSC. In adults, BSC was monitored during three non-nutritive conditions: volitional, spontaneous wake, and sleep conditions. Post-swallow expiration was found to be predominant in all conditions for all participants at all ages. In addition, the infant results revealed that nutritive BSC matured during the first year of life and differed to non-nutritive wakeful BSC, particularly in the first 2 months of life. Non-nutritive wakeful and sleep BSC did not differ from one another. In summary, the infant results support increasing cortical input into volitional nutritive BSC, an early impact of feeding on BSC, and no difference between BSC when asleep and non-volitional non-nutritive swallows when awake. The results obtained from adults revealed that irrespective of the level of arousal, volitional BSC is different to non-volitional BSC. These results imply that cortical influence on BSC is limited to conditions in which swallowing is voluntarily initiated. The combined interpretation of infant and adult results suggest that cortical influence over BSC, although increasing with maturation, is limited to the volitional swallowing conditions of feeding in infants and during non-nutritive but volitional swallows in adults. From this, it can be deduced that the most likely cortical sites involved in BSC are those involved in the voluntary initiation or planning of swallowing. Infant and adult swallowing apnoea duration (SAD) was also compared across all of the above conditions. SAD was influenced by feeding throughout the first year of life but was not influenced by level of arousal at any stage in the first year or in adulthood. Also, SAD did not change with age in any swallowing condition during infancy. However, comparison of non-nutritive wake SAD across the lifespan revealed that SAD of newborns and young adults is shorter than that of elderly adults, with no difference between consecutive age-groups: newborns, one-year-olds, and young adults. These results suggest SAD is largely mature at birth and impervious to descending suprabulbar influence. Finally, the effects of volitional swallowing and level of arousal on peak submental surface electromyography (SEMG) was investigated in adults. Like BSC, submental muscle activity was influenced only by volitional swallowing, being longer for volitional than non-volitional swallows without being influenced by level of arousal. Since peak submental SEMG activity represents a measure of relative hyolaryngeal excursion, these results suggest that the cortex has some degree of influence over this particular feature of pharyngeal-stage swallowing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breathing</field><field name="subject">swallowing</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">infant</field><field name="subject">neural controls</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between eating disorder  psychopathology and quality of life within a nonclinical  sample</field><field name="creator">Vallance, Joanna</field><field name="description">Recently researchers have begun investigating the impact of eating disorders on  quality of life (QOL). The present study examines the impact of eating disorder  psychopathology on QOL within a non-clinical sample. Two hundred and fourteen  women completed questionnaires assessing eating disorder symptoms, body  dissatisfaction, body checking and body avoidance behaviours and general  psychopathology. The results indicated that eating disturbance and body image  dissatisfaction were associated with a poorer QOL. In addition, eating disorder  psychopathology uniquely predicted QOL above and beyond the variance accounted  for by general psychopathology. These results indicate that eating disorder  psychopathology is negatively impacting on the lives of women within the  community.

M. L.)</field><field name="description">Infection by Campylobacter is the most notified gastrointestinal disease in New Zealand. Reliable recovery and identification of campylobacters is challenging. Improved and validated methods are needed to increase the power of subtyping and epidemiological studies to trace the sources and transmission routes of Campylobacter. An enrichment-PCR method for the isolation and detection of C. jejuni and C. coli was developed and sensitivity levels determined in 13 environmental matrices, including animal faeces, food and water. Less than ten cells per sample of either C. jejuni or C. coli could be detected, except for rabbit faeces where the minimum number of cells detected per sample was greater than ten cells for C. coli (range 3-32 cells). The sensitivity of the method was comparable to that determined for the conventional methods in the same matrices. Application of the method to retail chicken carcasses (n =204) determined a prevalence of 27.5% C. jejuni and 1% C. coli. River water assays (n = 293) found 55.3% of samples to contain C. jejuni and 4.1% C. coli. Furthermore, the enrichment-PCR assay was shown to identify up to three subtypes in individual water samples.  It was proposed that the identification of non-dominant subtypes carried by a chicken carcass may aid the identification of subtypes implicated in human cases of campylobacteriosis. An average of twenty-three C. jejuni isolates from each of ten retail chicken carcass were subtyped by PFGE using the two restriction enzymes SmaI and KpnI. Fifteen subtypes, in total, were identified from the ten carcasses. One subtype was identified on three carcasses. Five carcasses carried a single subtype, three carcasses carried two subtypes each and two carcasses carried three subtypes each. Some of the subtypes carried by an individual carcass were shown to be clonally related raising the question of in vivo recombination events during host passage. Comparison of C. jejuni subtypes from chickens with those isolated from human clinical cases revealed three of the fifteen subtypes correlated with those from human cases. None of the minority subtypes were identified in human case isolate data, suggesting that the lack of identification of non-dominant subtypes from chicken carcasses may not hinder the investigation of campylobacteriosis outbreaks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">environmental matrices</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Pleistocene Glacial Geology of the Hope-Waiau Valley System in North Canterbury, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rother, Henrik</field><field name="description">This thesis presents stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochronological results from valley fill and glacial moraines of the Hope-Waiau Valleys in North Canterbury, New Zealand. The findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of the modern valley fill comprises in-situ sedimentary sequences that were deposited during the penultimate glaciation (OIS 6), the last interglacial (OIS 5) and during the mid-late last glacial cycle (OIS 3/2). The sediments survived at low elevations in the valley floor despite overriding by later glacial advances. Sedimentologically, the fill indicates deposition in an ice marginal zone and consists of paraglacial/distal-proglacial aggradation gravels and ice-proximal/marginal-subglacial sediments. Deposition during glacial advance phases was characterized by the sedimentation of outwash gravels and small push moraines while glacial retreat phases are dominated by glaciolacustrine deposits which are frequently interbedded with debris flow diamictons. The overall depositional arrangement indicates that glacial retreat from the lower valley portion occurred via large scale ice stagnation.     Results from infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating gives evidence for five large aggradation and degradation phases in the Hope-Waiau Valleys over the last 200 ka. Combined with surface exposure dating (SED) of moraines the geochronological results indicate that glacial advances during OIS 6 were substantially larger in both ice extent and ice volume than during OIS 4-2. The last glacial maximum (LGM) ice advance occurred prior to 20.5 ka and glacial retreat from extended ice positions began by ~18 ka BP. A late glacial re-advance (Lewis Pass advance) occurred at ~13 ka BP and is probably associated with a regional cooling event correlated to the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR).     The findings from the Hope-Waiau Valleys were integrated into a model for glaciations in the Southern Alps which uses data from a snow mass balance model to analyse the sensitivity of glacial accumulation to temperature forcing. Model results indicate that in the central hyperhumid sector of the Southern Alps ice would expand rapidly with minor cooling (2-4&#8451;) suggesting that full glaciation could be generated with little thermal forcing. Some Quaternary glacial advances in the Southern Alps may have been triggered by regional climate phenomena (e.g. changes in ENSO mode) rather than requiring a thermal trigger from the Northern Hemisphere.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Glacial Geology</field><field name="subject">Quaternary</field><field name="subject">Glacial sedimentology</field><field name="subject">Glacial geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Cosmogenic Dating</field><field name="subject">Luminescence Dating</field><field name="subject">Waiau River</field><field name="subject">Southern Alps</field><field name="subject">Mountain Glaciations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal variation and inter-relationship of movement and resource selection of red deer (Cervus elaphus) with respect to climate: a case study</field><field name="creator">Hu, Qinglin</field><field name="description">Red deer (Cervus elaphus) is one of at least 31 herbivorous exotic mammals existing in New Zealand.

It was hypothesized that higher levels of positive perfectionism would be associated with higher academic achievement, higher achievement motivation, lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress, the use of more adaptive coping strategies, and positive personality variables, compared with negative perfectionists. Additionally, it was hypothesized that higher levels of negative perfectionism would be associated with lower levels of academic achievement, lower achievement motivation, higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, the use of more maladaptive coping strategies, and negative personality variables. 99 first year tertiary students participated, 71 from the University of Canterbury, and 28 from the Christchurch College of Education. The Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) was used to measure positive, negative and total levels of perfectionism. The short-form of the Ray Achievement Orientation Scale (Ray AO) was used to measure the level of achievement motivation. The NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI) was used to measure the "Big Five" personality variables (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience). The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) was used to measure levels of positive and negative affect. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) was used to measure levels of depression, anxiety and stress. The COPE was used to measure the use of functional and dysfunctional coping strategies. Demographic and academic information were obtained from student's academic files. The results indicated that, generally, the hypotheses were correct. Positive perfectionism showed associations with higher academic achievement, higher achievement motivation, positive personality factors, and more use of functional  forms of coping, while negative perfectionism showed associations with negative affect, depression, anxiety, stress, negative personality factors, and more use of dysfunctional coping strategies. It is therefore concluded that positive perfectionism can have a positive association with academic achievement, achievement motivation and general well-being, while negative perfectionism can have a negative association with these factors.  Many individuals are concerned with meeting high standards for performance. Consequently, the concept of perfectionism has been studied increasingly in the last few decades. The concept has evolved to now being formally defined, theoretically integrated and empirically measured (Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2002a; Flett &amp; Hewitt, 2002b; Rheaume, Freeston, Dugas, Letarte &amp; Ladouceur, 1995).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perfectionism</field><field name="subject">academic achievement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental Grief when a child is diagnoised with a life-threatening chronic-illness: The impact of gender, perceptions and coping strategies.</field><field name="creator">Betman, Johannah Erna Marie</field><field name="description">The grief experienced by mothers and fathers when their child is diagnosed with a life threatening chronic-illness was investigated in order to validate the presence of grief in these parents and look at the factors that influence it. More specifically, I was interested in whether the grief experience differed for mothers and fathers and the impact that perceptions and coping have on both these gender differences in grief and on grief in general. The particular population investigated in this study were parents of children with Cystic Fibrosis. Participants were recruited through questionnaires randomly sent out by the National Cystic Fibrosis Association. In all, 37 mothers and 15 fathers took part. Results not only confirmed presence of grief in these parents but also indicated that this grief differs for mothers and fathers, with mothers reporting significantly higher levels of physical distress. In line with the literature no gender differences were found in regards to perception of impact parents felt their child's chronic-illness had had on their lives. Contrary to what was expected, however, no differences were found amongst the coping strategies used by mothers and fathers. In regards to the question of which factors have the greatest impact on the grief experienced by mothers and fathers combined, the coping strategy of self-blame was found to be the most important, followed closely by negative perceptions.

Expected losses in terms of dollar value and casualties are calculated for two earthquake scenarios.    Findings are based on: (1) data describing the earthquake ground shaking and microzonation effects; (2) an inventory of buildings by value, floor area, replacement value, occupancy and age; (3) damage ratios defining the performance of buildings as a function of earthquake intensity; (4) daytime and night-time population distribution data and (5) casualty functions defining casualty risk as a function of building damage. A GIS serves as a platform for collecting, storing and analyzing the original and the derived data. It also allows for easy display of input and output data, providing a critical functionality for communication of outcomes.    The results of this study suggest that economic losses due to building damage in the Christchurch CBD and Mount Pleasant will possibly be in the order of $5.6 and $35.3 million in a magnitude 8.0 Alpine fault earthquake and a magnitude 7.0 Ashley fault earthquake respectively. Damage to non-residential buildings constitutes the vast majority of the economic loss.

It focuses on the interactions between waves and currents in the swash zone and the resulting sediment transport. No previous study has attempted to concurrently measure wave and current data and longshore sediment transport rates on a mixed sand and gravel lakeshore beach in New Zealand. Many of these beaches, in both the oceanic and lacustrine environments, are in net long-term erosion. It is recognised that longshore sediment transport is a part of this process, but very little knowledge has existed regarding rates of sediment movement and the relationships between waves, currents and swash activity in the foreshore of these beach types. A field programme was designed to measure a comprehensive range of wind, wave, current and morphological variables concurrently with longshore transport. Four electronic instruments were used to measure both waves and currents simultaneously in the offshore, nearshore and swash zone. In the offshore area, an InterOcean S4ADW wave and current meter was installed to record wave height, period, direction and velocity. A WG-30 capacitance wave gauge measured the total water surface variation. A pair of Marsh-McBirney electromagnetic current meters, measuring current directions and velocities were installed in the nearshore and swash zone. Data were sampled for 18 minutes every hour with a Campbell Scientific CR23x data-logger. The wave gauge data was sampled at a rate of 10 Hz (0.1 s) and the two current meters at a rate of 2 Hz (0.5 s). Longshore sediment transport rates were investigated with the use of two traps placed in the nearshore and swash zone to collect sediment transported under wave and swash action. This occurred concurrently with the wave measurements and together yielded over 500 individual hours of high quality time series data. Important new insights were made into lake wave processes in New Zealand's alpine lakes. Measured wave heights averaged 0.20-0.35 m and ranged up to 0.85 m. Wave height was found to be strongly linked to the wind and grew rapidly to increasing wind strength in an exponential fashion. Wave period responded more slowly and required time and distance for the wave length to develop. Overall, there was a narrow band of wave periods with means ranging from 1.43 to 2.33 s. The wave spectrum was found to be more mixed and complicated than had previously been assumed for lake environments. Spectral band width parameters were large, with 95% of the values between 0.75 and 0.90. The wave regime attained the characteristics of a storm wave spectrum. The waves were characteristically steep and capable of obtaining far greater steepness than oceanic wind-waves. Values ranged from 0.010 to 0.074, with an average of 0.051. Waves were able to progress very close to shore without modification and broke in water less than 0.5 m deep. Wave refraction from deep to shallow water only caused wave angles to be altered in the order of 10%. The two main breaker types were spilling and plunging. However, rapid increases in beach slope near the shoreline often caused the waves to plunge immediately landward of the swash zone, leading to a greater proportion of plunging waves. Wave energy attenuation was found to be severe. Measured velocities were some 10 times less at two thirds the water depth beneath the wave. Mean orbital velocities were 0.30 m s&#8315;&#185; in deep water and 0.15 m s&#8315;&#185; in shallow water. The ratio difference between the measured deep water orbital velocities and the nearshore orbital velocities was just under one half (us/uo = 0.58), almost identical to the predicted phase velocity difference by Linear wave theory. In general Linear wave theory was found to provide good approximations of the wave conditions in a small lake environment. The swash zone is an important area of wave dissipation and it defines the limits of sediment transport. The width of the swash zone was found to be controlled by the wave height, which in turn determined the quantity of sediment transported through the swash zone. It ranged in width from 0.05 m to 6.0 m and widened landward in response to increased wave height and lakeward in response the wave length. Slope was found to be an important secondary control on swash zone width. In low energy conditions, swash zone slopes were typically steep. At the onset of wave activity the swash zone becomes scoured by swash activity and the beach slope grades down. An equation was developed, using the wave height and beach slope that provides close estimates of the swash zone width under a wide range of conditions. Run-up heights were calculated using the swash zone width and slope angle. Run-up elevations ranged from 0.01 m to 0.73 m and were strongly related to the wave height and the beach slope. On average, run-up exceeds the deep water wave height by a factor of 1.16H. The highest run-up elevations were found to occur at intermediate slope angles of between 6-8&#176;. Above 8&#176;, the run-up declined in response to beach porosity and lower wave energy conditions. A generalised run-up equation for lake environments has been developed, that takes into account the negative relationship between beach slope and run-up. Swash velocities averaged 0.30 m s&#8315;&#185; but maximum velocities averaged 0.98 m s&#8315;&#185;. After wave breaking, swash velocities quickly reduced through dissipation by approximately one half. Swash velocity was strongly linked to wave height and beach slope. Maximum velocities occurred at beach slopes of 5&#176;, where incident swash dominated. At slopes between 6&#176; and 10&#176;, swash velocities were hindered by turbulence, but the relative differences between the swash and backswash flows were negligible. At slope angles above 10&#176; there was a slight asymmetry to the swash/backswash flow velocities due to beach porosity absorbing water at the limits of the swash zone. Three equations were developed for estimating the mean and maximum swash velocity flows. From an analysis of these interactions, a process-response model was developed that formalises the morphodynamic response of the swash zone to wave activity. Longshore sediment transport occurred exclusively in the swash zone, landward of the breaking wave in bedload. The sediments collected in transit were a heterogeneous mix of coarse sands and fine-large gravels. Hourly trapped rates ranged from 0.02 to 214.88 kg hr&#8315;&#185;. Numerical methods were developed to convert trapped mass rates in to volumetric rates that use the density and porosity of the sediment. A sediment transport flux curve was developed from measuring the distribution of longshore sediment transport across the swash zone. Using numerical integration, the area under this curve was calculated and an equation written to accurately estimate the total integrated transport rates in the swash zone. The total transport rates ranged from a minimum of 1.10 x 10-5 m&#179; hr&#8315;&#185; to a maximum of 1.15 m&#179; hr&#8315;&#185;. The mean rate was 7.36 x 10&#8315;&#178; m&#179; hr&#8315;&#185;. Sediment transport was found to be most strongly controlled by the wave height, period, wave steepness and mean swash velocity. Transport is initiated when waves break at an oblique angle to the shoreline. No relationships could be found between the grain size and transport rates. Instead, the critical threshold velocities of the sediment sizes were almost always exceed in the turbulent conditions under the breaking wave. The highest transport rates were associated with the lowest beach slopes. It was found that this was linked to swash high velocities and wave heights associated with foreshore scouring. An expression was developed to estimate the longshore sediment transport, termed the LEXSED formula, that divides the cube of the wave height and the wave length and multiplies this by the mean swash velocity and the wave approach angle. The expression performs well across a wide range of conditions and the estimates show very good correlations to the empirical data. LEXSED was used to calculate an accurate annual sediment transport budget for the fieldsite beaches. LEXSED was compared to 16 other longshore sediment transport formulas and performed best overall. The underlying principles of the model make its application to other mixed sand and gravel beaches promising.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Longshore sediment transport</field><field name="subject">lakeshore processes</field><field name="subject">Lake Coleridge</field><field name="subject">swash zone</field><field name="subject">run-up</field><field name="subject">lake waves</field><field name="subject">transport equations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coal seam gas associations in the Huntly, Ohai and Greymouth regions, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Butland, Caroline</field><field name="description">Coal seam gas has been recognised as a new, potential energy resource in New Zealand. Exploration  and assessment programmes carried out by various companies have evaluated the resource and  indicated that this unconventional gas may form a part of New Zealand's future energy supply. This  study has delineated some of the controls between coal properties and gas content in coal seams in  selected New Zealand locations.  Four coal cores, one from Huntly (Eocene), two from Ohai (Cretaceous) and one from Greymouth  (Cretaceous), have been sampled and analysed in terms of gas content and coal properties. Methods  used include proximate, sulphur and calorifc value analyses; ash constituent determination; rank  assessment; macroscopic analysis; mineralogical analysis; maceral analysis; and gas analyses  (desorption, adsorption, gas quality and gas isotopes).  Coal cores varied in rank from sub-bituminous B-A (Huntly); sub-bituminous C-A (Ohai); and high  volatile bituminous A (Greymouth). All locations contained high vitrinite content (~85 %) with  overall relatively low mineral matter observed in most samples. Mineral matter consisted of both  detrital grains (quartz in matrix material) and infilling pores and fractures (clays in fusinite pores;  carbonates in fractures). Average gas contents were 1.6 m3/t in the Huntly core, 4.7 m3/t in the Ohai  cores, and 2.35 m3/t in the Greymouth core. The Ohai core contained more gas and was more  saturated than the other cores. Carbon isotopes indicated that the Ohai gas composition was more  mature, containing heavier 13C isotopes than either the Huntly or Greymouth gas samples. This  indicates the gas was derived from a mixed biogenic and thermogenic source. The Huntly and  Greymouth gases appear to be derived from a biogenic (by CO2 reduction) source.  The ash yield proved to be the dominant control on gas volume in all locations when the ash yield  was above 10 %. Below 10 % the amount of gas variation is unrelated to ash yield. Although  organic content had some influence on gas volume, associations were basin and /or rank dependant.  In the Huntly core total gas content and structured vitrinite increased together. Although this  relationship did not appear in the other cores, in the Ohai SC3 core lost gas and fusinite are  associated with each other, while desmocollinite (unstructured vitrinite) correlated positively with  residual gas in the Greymouth core. Although it is generally accepted that higher rank coals will  have higher adsorption capacities, this was not seen in this data set. Although the lowest rank coal  (Huntly) contains the lowest adsorption capacity, the highest adsorption capacity was not seen in the  highest rank coal (Greymouth), but in the Ohai coal instead.  The Ohai core acted like a higher rank coal with respect to the Greymouth coal, in terms of  adsorption capacity, isotopic signatures and gas volume. Two hypothesis can be used to explain  these results: (1) That a thermogenically derived gas migrated from down-dip of the SC3 and SC1  drill holes and saturated the section. (2) Rank measurements (e.g. proximate analyses) have a fairly  wide variance in both the Greymouth and Ohai coal cores, thus it maybe feasible that the Ohai cores  may be higher rank coal than the Greymouth coal core. Although the second hypothesis may explain  the adsorption capacity, isotopic signatures and the gas volume, when the data is plotted on a  Suggate rank curve, the Ohai coal core is clearly lower rank than the Greymouth core. Thus,  pending additional data, the first hypothesis is favoured.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal seam gas</field><field name="subject">Macroscopic analysis</field><field name="subject">Mineralogical analysis</field><field name="subject">Desorption</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Gas quality</field><field name="subject">Gas isotopes</field><field name="subject">Ohai</field><field name="subject">Huntly</field><field name="subject">Greymouth</field><field name="subject">Ash yield</field><field name="subject">Vitrinite</field><field name="subject">Macerals</field><field name="subject">Sub-bituminous</field><field name="subject">Fusinite</field><field name="subject">Suggate rank</field><field name="subject">Coal geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Petrographic analyses</field><field name="subject">Organic petrology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Rock Weathering Along the Victoria Land Coast, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Christine Eleanor</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to investigate the physical weathering of rock along the Victoria Land Coast, Antarctica.  It was designed to contribute to the Latitudinal Gradient Project, a joint initiative between the New Zealand, Italian and United States Antarctic Programmes.  The Latitudinal Gradient Project aims to improve our understanding of the ecosystems of the Dry Valleys and ice-free areas of the Ross Sea Region and, by using latitude as a proxy measure, identify how they might be affected by future climate change.    The approach taken for this research was to use information on rock (from one rock group) temperature and moisture conditions gathered from three field locations to inform laboratory simulations.  The laboratory simulations would then be used to investigate the weathering of small rock blocks and aggregates. Two temperature cycles approximating those experienced during summer and spring/autumn were identified and simulations undertaken in a specially adapted freezer.  Three levels of moisture were applied: no moisture, half saturation and full saturation.  Results of the laboratory simulations indicated that although rocks responded in different ways to different processes, granular disintegration took place even in the absence of additional moisture and did not require crossings of the 0 OC isotherm, nor were high levels of moisture required for across zero temperature cycling to produce weathering effects.   A model that related weathering to latitude was developed and changes in climate explored.  It was found that the weathering effect of summer and spring/autumn cycles was different and depended on rock characteristics rather than latitude.  Increasing the ratio of summer to spring/autumn temperature cycles by 10% indicated that weathering could decrease or remain the same depending on the particular rock.  Changes in temperature were found to be more important than changes in moisture.  A weathering index that related local climate and rock properties to weathering was also developed and this highlighted the difficulties of using laboratory results to predict field rates of weathering.  There were some surprising results from the field, including the presence of much more moisture on the surface of the rock, primarily from blowing snow, than had been predicted for this dry environment.  This occurred even in the presence of negative rock surface temperatures.  In addition, winter rock surface temperatures can fluctuate up to 25 OC, getting as  warm  as -10 OC.  Macro-climate and changes in air temperature in response to foehn and katabatic winds were the drivers for these fluctuations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctica;  rock weathering; laboratory simulation; mositure; Latitudinal Gradient Project; weathering index</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How does mitochondrial heteroplasmy affect cell proliferation?</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Selina Kaye</field><field name="description">Mitochondrial mutations and heteroplasmy have been associated with disease states  that result from inadequate cellular energy production. As mitochondrial DNA  (mtDNA) encodes many of the polypeptides involved in oxidative phosphorylation  (OXPHOS), mtDNA mutations may lower energy production which is required for  cell division and sustained ATP synthesis. In order to test the relationship between  mtDNA mutations and the rate of cell division, a mammary epithelial cancer cell line,  MCF-7, is used as a model. Nine proliferate single cell clones have been isolated from  MCF-7. Population doubling times of six single cell clones and the MCF-7 stock have  been determined. Clones with distinctly different growth rates were selected for  mutational analysis. Growth rates of these clones appeared to be different from each  other. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, three cases of  heteroplasmy have been identified in the mitochondrial genes of the MCF-7 stock and  four single cell clones (ATPase C9119T, ND6 T14300G, Cytb G15807A).  Heteroplasmy present in the Cytb gene is differs between single cell clones.  Differences between the growth rates may be indicative of metabolic variations in  these single cell clones. The OXPHOS enzymes encoded by the mutated genes were  quantified by standard enzymatic assays. The assays demonstrated significant  differences in specific activity between the clones, but were not correlated with  mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This thesis determines that the differences in specific  activity observed between clones is of nuclear origin.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">DNA mutation</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">oxidative phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">cancer cell line</field><field name="subject">cell proliferation</field><field name="subject">population doubling time</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Reproductive Ecology and Biology of the Pill-box Crab: Halicarcinus cookii (Brachyura: Hymenosomatidae) Filhol, 1885</field><field name="creator">van den Brink, Anneke Maria</field><field name="description">This study investigates the reproductive strategies of the pill-box crab, Halicarcinus cookii on the Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand. Various aspects essential to understanding reproductive strategies were examined including growth, population dynamics, reproductive biology and mating behaviour. H. cookii exhibits obvious sexual dimorphism such that females develop wide abdomens forming brood chambers, and males tend to grow larger than females and have larger chelipeds in relation to body size. H. cookii allocates energy into growth and reproduction in separate phases of its life cycle where growth ceases as reproductive maturity begins due to a terminal/pubertal moult. Despite the presence of ovigerous females throughout the 15 month sampling period, the population was highly seasonal, with peaks in recruitment and growth occurring primarily during the winter months and peaks in numbers of mature individuals during the summer months.  Reproductive output increased with body size in H. cookii, as larger females produced more eggs and larger males transferred more sperm than their smaller counterparts. Ovaries matured prior to the terminal/pubertal moult (anecdysis) and, in multiparous females, in synchrony with brood development, allowing females to produce broods in quick succession, maximising their reproductive output in their short life span (approximately 12-18 months, 6 months as an adult). Incubation duration of broods decreased as seawater temperature increased, suggesting that temperature is the primary cause of the seasonal population cycling.  Sperm storage allowed females to produce at least 4 fertilised broods without re-mating. Some sperm mixing in the spermathecae appeared to occur and the ventral-type structure implies last male sperm precedence. Males therefore preferentially mated with females closest to laying a new brood and guarded them longer than other females to ensure their paternity. Guarding duration varied according to the sex ratio allowing males to maximise their reproductive output.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crustacea</field><field name="subject">Brachyura</field><field name="subject">mating strategy</field><field name="subject">crab</field><field name="subject">Halicarcinus</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">Kaikoura</field><field name="subject">intertidal</field><field name="subject">egg development</field><field name="subject">mate attraction</field><field name="subject">population ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">R Coronae Borealis stars : characteristics of their decline phase</field><field name="creator">Skuljan, Ljiljana</field><field name="description">R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars belong to a rare class of variable stars characterized by sudden and unpredictable declines, which are believed to be caused by dust cloud obscuration. In spite of the fact that these stars are so rare (only about 40 are known in our Galaxy), there are many reasons for investigating them. The unusual variability and peculiar chemical composition make them unique among all known types of variable stars. Their evolution and the nature of their unpredictable minima are still not entirely understood. Very few observations of RCB stars during the decline phase exist. Only three RCB stars (R CrB, RY Sgr and V854 Cen) have been studied in detail and only a few declines have been completely covered by observations. This thesis investigates the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of RCB variables during their decline phases. A programme of photometric and spectroscopic observations of nine RCB and three HdC stars has been undertaken at Mt John University Observatory (MJUO) over a period of two and a half years. The programme includes some typical examples of RCB stars (Teff ~ 7000 K), as well as some cool ones (Teff ~ 5000 K). One of the most unusual of all RCB stars, V854 Cen, is also included. The photometric observations, as part of the long-term monitoring of RCB stars at MJUO, have provided the UBVRIphotometry and have served as a decline indicator. Complex colour changes during the declines were monitored and compared with the spectroscopy. The photometry during the recovery phases of the nine RCB stars in the last 12 years was used for studying the extinction properties of the gas obscuring the photosphere. An analysis of 26 different declines shows that the material causing the declines has extinction properties similar to those of the interstellar medium. The medium and high-resolution spectroscopy has been obtained for six declines of different programme stars using the 1-m telescope at MJUO. Although the duration and depth of the declines are very different, they all show similar photometric and spectroscopic characteristics. The results have been compared with other observations and used to examine a simple line-region model (E1/E2/BL), which attempts to describe the evolution and origin of emission lines during a decline. In general, the evolution of various emission lines observed in this work is consistent with their classification into these three groups. However, some characteristics of the emission lines indicate a different origin from that suggested by the model. A very rich emission line spectrum was monitored during the 1998 decline of V854 Cen, while only the most prominent lines were observed in the other stars. Short-lived high-excitation lines from the initial decline phase, such as CI and 01, were classified as Ei. They show a characteristic, shock-induced red shift indicating the photospheric origin. Lines classified as E2 are mainly from the low-excitation ions and neutral atoms. All lines from this group appear at the very beginning of the decline and are visible through to the late recovery phase, slightly blue-shifted relative to the stellar velocity. The lines of the low-excitation ions exhibit a complex structure with a strong central and two weaker components, one on each side. Their absolute flux evolution has been compared with the changes in the stellar continuum flux. The behaviour of these lines indicates that they are not affected by the dust cloud in the same way as the photospheric continuum. Assuming that the dust cloud is formed at about 2R* and taking into account the acceleration obtained from the analysis of the high-velocity Nal D absorption lines, the position of the E2 line emitting region was estimated to be about 3R* - 5R*. The third group (BL) consists of broad emission lines, which are a typical feature of all observed declines. The most prominent broad lines present in all RCB stars belong to the Nal D doublet. The observations demonstrate that these lines are the strongest in V854 Cen, due to the significant amount of material produced by its frequent declines. In contrast to the E2 lines, whose fluxes have been found to decrease during the decline, the absolute flux of the broad lines stays constant throughout the whole decline phase. This is consistent with the idea that the broad emission is a permanent feature, whose visibility depends only on the photospheric brightness. Various Nal D components (sharp and broad emission and high-velocity absorption) have been analysed in a number of RCB declines and presented in this thesis. The high-velocity blue-shifted Nal D absorption demonstrates similar velocities (between -230 kms-1 and -400 kms-1), structure and behaviour in the different declines. The observations from the 1998 decline of V854 Cen clearly show that the high-velocity absorption lines can also appear during the initial decline phase. This suggests that they can be associated with the clouds formed in some previous declines, as well as with the current one. The spectroscopic observations of the 1998 decline of V854 Cen obtained in this thesis represent the first almost complete coverage of a decline of this star.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stars</field><field name="subject">variables</field><field name="subject">R Coronae Borealis</field><field name="subject">methods</field><field name="subject">data analysis</field><field name="subject">techniques</field><field name="subject">spectroscopic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological enhancement of an aphid parasitoid</field><field name="creator">Tylianakis, Jason</field><field name="description">Insects have become increasingly resistant to chemical control methods, while at the same time public awareness of the harmful effects of synthetic pesticides has increased. The search for more environmentally 'friendly' means of pest suppression is gaining momentum and biological control (the use of natural enemies to reduce populations of noxious organisms) has become an increasingly sought-after option.  Despite an increase in the establishment rate of insect natural enemies, classical biological control of arthropods is currently no more successful than it was one hundred years ago. Ecological theory relevant to population biology, food webs and diversity provides insight into how biological control agents can be made more effective, yet this theory has often been absent from the biological control literature. Examples of the use of ecological concepts (including intraguild predation, life-history omnivory and resource subsidies) in practical biological control are reviewed, and aspects of theory not yet considered in this context are discussed.  Cereals are important as primary food crops, globally and within New Zealand. Possibly the greatest amount of damage sustained by cereal crops in New Zealand is caused by aphids and chemical control of these pests is very expensive relative to biological control. This thesis examines how biological control of the rose-grain aphid Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) (Hemiptera: Aphidiidae) by the koinobiont, synovigenic endoparasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi De Stefani-Perez (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) can be enhanced by floral resource subsidies. The mechanisms underlying this enhancement were determined in a series of laboratory experiments and then tested in laboratory microcosms and in the field.   Sugar resources significantly increased longevity and egg load in A. rhopalosiphi and another species of aphidiid, Diaeretiella rapae McIntosh. Pollen had no significant effect on longevity or egg load in these species. These results are discussed in terms of the effects of resource subsidies on egg- versus time-limitation.  Laboratory microcosm experiments tested whether the mechanisms of increased potential fecundity via enhanced egg load and longevity translate into increased rates of parasitism (i.e., realised fecundity). Only treatments receiving sugar showed increased reproductive success. The presence of flowering buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (c.v. Kitawase) (Polygonaceae) plants caused a slight, non-significant increase in rates of parasitism.  Field surveys of natural aphid populations in a wheat Triticum aestivum (L.) (c.v. Otane) (Gramineae) field showed that proximity to floral buckwheat patches, distance to the nearest edge or the leeward end of the field were not significantly correlated with rates of parasitism. These variables were significantly correlated with aphid density in some surveys. Rates of parasitism were not correlated with aphid density. When aphid population density was controlled by experimental placement of aphids, proximity to floral resource patches significantly affected rates of parasitism. Parasitism rates were highest at the edges of buckwheat patches and declined exponentially with distance, eventually reaching zero beyond 14 m. Lower levels of parasitism were observed within the floral patches than at their edges. This phenomenon is compatible with the concept of spatio-temporal partitioning between parasitoid feeding and host-searching behaviours.  Potential costs (increased predation risk, opportunity costs) and benefits (increased fecundity and longevity) associated with floral feeding by parasitoids, and temporal variation in these factors, are discussed. It is concluded that resource subsidies are not only effective in the practical enhancement of the efficacy of a specific biological control agent, but their use is based on a sound foundation in ecological theory that allows extension of these principles across taxa.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">aphid</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">resource subsidy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of hormonal interaction on desensitization of the adrenocorticotropin response to arginine vasopressin in ovine anterior pituitary cells</field><field name="creator">Fan, Shujun</field><field name="description">Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are major physiological stimulators of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary gland, while glucocorticoids act as inhibitors. In addition to acting alone, CRH, AVP and glucocorticoids interact with each other to regulate ACTH release in response to stress. Prolonged or repeated stimulus results in attenuated ACTH responsiveness, a process termed as desensitization. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of interactions between CRH, AVP and steroids on desensitization of the ACTH response to AVP. Perifused ovine anterior pituitary cells were stimulated with three 5-min pulses of 100 nM AVP at 120, 200 and 280 min, and were continuously exposed to CRH (0.2 nM) from 80 min and/or cortisol (10-500 nM) from 0 min onwards. Desensitization was induced by a 15 min pre-treatment with 5 nM (0.5 nM for CRH alone) AVP immediately preceding the second AVP pulse. When CRH was absent, pre-treatment with 0.5 nM AVP did not influence the ACTH response to the second AVP pulse. In the presence of CRH, the response to the second AVP pulse was reduced to 66.7&#177;2.2% of control (n=6, P&lt;0.0001, t-test). On the other hand, following 5 nM AVP pre-treatment, continuous perifusion with cortisol (100 nM) results in a significantly smaller reduction in the response to the second AVP pulse compared with that seen in its absence (78.4&#177;1.7% c.f. 66.7&#177;1.9% of control; n=10, P&lt;0.001, t-test). In contrast to this, following 5 nM AVP pre-treatment, continuous CRH and cortisol in combination results in a greater reduction in the response to the second AVP pulse compared with that obtained in the absence of these two hormones (46.5&#177;1.7% c.f. 66.2&#177;1.7 of control; n=8, P&lt;0.0001, t-test). Taken together, these data suggest that desensitization of the ACTH response to AVP can be modulated by CRH and/or cortisol: CRH or CRH and cortisol in combination amplify this desensitization, whereas cortisol reduces it.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hormonal interaction</field><field name="subject">desensitization</field><field name="subject">adrenocorticotropin</field><field name="subject">vasopressin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification Studies of Bacillus Spores Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Kunnil, Joseph</field><field name="description">Fluorescence spectroscopy was examined as a potential technique for identifying aerosol particles like bacterial spores. This technique was used for laboratory measurements on some common biological agent simulants. We have measured the intrinsic steady-state fluorescence emission spectra as a function of the excitation wavelength for several bacterial spores (washed and unwashed) in dry and aqueous suspensions at room temperature using excitation wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm. These measurements were compared to those of common, naturally occurring biological components like fungal spores and pollen and non spore samples like ovalbumin. The spectra of samples were combined into fluorescence profiles or fluorescence fingerprints. Different substrates were used for collection and detection of spores. Each bacterium produces a unique in vitro fluorescence profile when measured in dried and aqueous suspension and exhibits a strong maximum in its fluorescence emission spectrum near 330-340 nm. The fluorescence profiles were reproducible. The complexity of microorganisms made the interpretation of their spectral signature a difficult task. Principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were done as a data reduction technique for detection and identification from different backgrounds. PCA illustrates that linear combination of detected fluorescence intensities, which are present in different ratios in each of samples studied, can be used to discriminate biological agent simulants from other biological samples. The hydration effects, washing effects and the role of tryptophan on spore fluorescence were also investigated. The emission spectra of the dried spores showed a maximum near 330 nm, suggesting a hydrophobic environment for its tryptophan residues. The aqueous solution of tryptophan showed fluorescence shifted to 360 nm and in ethanol solution the maximum was shifted to 340 nm, suggesting a rather more polar average location of the tryptophan. To find the limit of detection we measured the quantum efficiency (QE) of a few samples. We concluded that spectroscopy techniques coupled with effective interpretation models are applicable to biological simulants agents.

Its mode of action in plants is the disruption of the Shikimate pathway, part of an important route to the biosynthesis of essential aromatic amino acids. It is well documented that glyphosate can be degraded by soil microorganisms after contact of the herbicide solution with the soil. It is also accepted that glyphosate, an excellent ligand, is readily absorbed to metal ions, such as Fe(III), that can be abundant in soils.  There have been many accounts on the microbial degradation of glyphosate, and several metal-glyphosate complexes have been synthesised and characterised. Surprisingly, given the degree of adsorption to metal ions in the soil, there have not, to date, been any reports in the literature on the reactivity of metal-glyphosate complexes. The behaviour of these types of complexes under various reaction conditions may give us an insight into the mechanisms present when glyphosate degrades.  In order to explore the behaviour of metal-glyphosate adducts, we have prepared several new cobalt-PMG complexes in the lab. These complexes have been characterised by NMR, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and in some cases X-ray crystal structure determination. We chose to synthesise complexes where the PMG ligand is bidentate or tridentate, filling the remaining four or three (respectively) coordination sites with an ancillary, nitrogen-containing ligand.  We have subjected the complexes to photolytic and basic conditions, as we are interested in ascertaining how coordinated PMG might behave when irradiated with UV light, and when it is C-deprotonated. Metal-glyphosate complexes in nature may be exposed to UV light, so we are concerned with how the coordinated ligand might react under these circumstances. We have found that the prepared cobalt-PMG complexes are reactive when exposed to UV light, and that this appears to result in the degradation of the complex, and in some cases, the PMG ligand itself.  The reactivity of C-deprotonated PMG is also an area of interest to us. It is possible that elevations in soil pH can lead to C-deprotonation of glyphosate, then further reactivity that may contribute to the degradation of the compound. Furthermore, when the herbicide is held in the active site of an enzyme within a microbe, it may become deprotonated, and this may aid in its microbial degradation. We have found that, under basic conditions, the reactivity of the prepared PMG complexes depends on the ancillary ligand attached - &#960;-acidic, pyridine-containing ancillary ligands appear to increase the reactivity of coordinated PMG. It seems that amine-containing ligands hinder the reactivity of the coordinated PMG such that the complex remains intact.  It is hoped that the results of the research described in this thesis will assist in the future investigations into the reactivity of the herbicide glyphosate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glyphosate complexes</field><field name="subject">photochemistry</field><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">glyphosate degradation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes to the cytoskeleton and cell wall underlie invasive hyphal growth.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Sophie</field><field name="description">Tip growth is a form of cellular expansion characteristic of fungal hyphae and some types of plant cells.  Currently there is no unified model that satisfactorily describes this in hyphal species.  Traditionally turgor has been considered an essential driving force behind cell expansion.  In recent years this hypothesis has been challenged by evidence that in some species tip growth can occur despite the absence of measurable hydrostatic pressure.  There are currently two contentious theories of hyphal extension.  These are the turgor-driven model and the amoeboid-movement theory.  Though the essential mechanism underlying cell growth differs between these theories, the actin cytoskeleton is considered important in both.  It has been suggested that both the turgor-driven and amoeboid-like modes of growth could occur depending on the whether the hyphae are growing invasively or non-invasively respectively (Money, 1990).  It has also been proposed that both modes may occur within the same mycelium (Garrill, 2000). Two distinct patterns of actin have been identified in the hyphal tips of oomycetes.  This has lead to the hypothesis that two different mechanisms of apical extension may be employed by some hyphal organisms.  During the course of this thesis, actin deplete zones have been observed in a significantly higher number of invasive compared to non-invasive hyphae of the oomycete Achlya bisexualis.  Furthermore the difference between burst pressures was found to be lower in invasive hyphae compared to non-invasive hyphae suggestive of a weaker cell wall.  A lack of significant difference in turgor pressures between the invasive and non-invasive hyphae of this organism suggests that the deplete zone and weaker wall plays a functional role in enabling hyphae to penetrate substrate.  Fractal analysis of mycelial colonies shows that the variation in agar concentration and therefore substrate solidity has a significant effect on mycelial morphology.  This is most likely due to an effect at the cellular level.  The results of the experiments carried out during the course of this thesis provide the basis for future work towards elucidating the mechanisms of hyphal extension.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Actin</field><field name="subject">hyphae</field><field name="subject">oomycete</field><field name="subject">invasive growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Switches: The Design, Synthesis and Biological Applications of Photoactive Enzyme Inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Nathan Austin</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the design, synthesis and biological applications of a series of inhibitors which incorporate an azobenzene photoswitch, a peptidyl backbone and a trifluoromethyl ketone warhead. The photoswitch can be isomerised by irradiation with UV or visible light and has been employed to modulate the reactivity of the enzyme.    Chapter one gives a brief outline of some of the important areas related to this work. Examples of previously utilised photoswitches as well as some background on serine protease and the uses of fluorine in medicine has been covered.    Chapter two outlines the synthesis of the key trifluoromethyl carbinol 2.6 by two different methods. The condensation of a fluorinated aldehyde with a nitroalkane affords an &#945;-nitro trifluoromethyl carbinol which can be reduced to give the desired amine 2.6. Treatment of oxazolones with trifluoroacetic anhydride via a modified Dakin-West reaction gives trifluoromethyl ketones which can be reduced to give trifluoromethyl carbinols.    Chapter three investigate the synthesis of substituted stilbenes and phenanthrenes as alternative molecular switches to azobenzenes. Molecular modelling of phenanthrenes suggests they may be suitable mimics of E-azobenzenes.    Chapter four outlines the synthesis of a series of mono and disubstituted azobenzenes by direct sulfonation of azobenzene or by condensation of nitroso arenes with aryl amines. The switches incorporate one or two peptidyl residues designed to improve specificity towards the enzyme.    Chapter five examines the photoisomerisation of eight potential inhibitors by irradiating with UV or visible light. Irradiation with UV light enriches the sample to give 78-93 % of the Z-isomer. Irradiation with visible light gave photostationary states with 14-21 % Z-isomer. Ambient photostationary states are ca. 22 % Z-isomer.     Chapter six looks at the testing of five trifluoromethyl ketones as potential inhibitors of&#945;-chymotrypsin. The inhibitors vary in substituents, substitution patterns and chain length. The inhibitors were tested at both ambient and Z-enriched photostationary states and were found to exhibit slow binding kinetics. In all cases the Z-enriched inhibitor solution was at least 3-fold more potent than the ambient solution.    Chapter seven is an experimental chapter and outlines the synthesis of the compounds prepared in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular Switches</field><field name="subject">Chymotrypsin</field><field name="subject">enzyme inhibition</field><field name="subject">photoswitching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Periphyton growth in the Waipara River, North Canterbury</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Shirley</field><field name="description">Periphyton was monitored monthly at four sites on the Waipara River from July 1999 to January 2002.  Interactions with river flows, nutrients and invertebrates were examined to determine how these factors controlled periphyton development.     Comparison of the Waipara River to other New Zealand streams indicated that periphyton biomass at the uppermost site (Site 1) was generally low to moderate.  Further downstream, moderate to high biomass occurred at sites 2 and 4.  Biomass at Site 3 was generally low, although some very high values occurred on occasions.  Periphyton biomass at sites 2 and 4 exceeded periphyton guidelines for the protection of aesthetic/recreational values at least once during each full year monitored.  In contrast, the guidelines were rarely exceeded at Site 1.      Dissolved inorganic nutrients were generally poor indicators of the nutrient status of the river because of plant uptake.  Cellular N and P values indicated nutrient enrichment at sites 2 and 4, which correspondingly had the highest biomass values.  Conductivity tended to positively correlate with temporal and spatial patterns in periphyton biomass and was useful as a surrogate indicator of nutrient supply regimes.  It correlated negatively with river flows, indicating higher nutrient concentrations may occur during reduced flows.     Notable differences  occurred in biomass development between periods of contrasting flow regimes.  In particular, annual mean and maximum biomass at the three downstream sites was considerably higher during a period of low stable flows compared to a period of higher base flows.  However, at the uppermost site, differences in biomass between these periods were much less pronounced.      Invertebrate densities increased significantly with increasing periphyton biomass at the three downstream sites.  There was little indication that invertebrates had any major control on periphyton biomass at these sites.  However, at the uppermost site, although the invertebrate densities were generally much lower than at the other sites, they are more likely to have a controlling influence on periphyton biomass.      Overall, the nutrient supply regime of the Waipara River is the primary controller on biomass development.  Flow regimes (both frequency of disturbance and extent of low flows) operate as secondary controls of biomass.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periphyton</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of vocal communication in the biology of fledgling and juvenile kea  (nestor notabilis) in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Debbie Maree</field><field name="description">The kea is the only parrot species in the world to include the true alpine environment as part of   their habitat. Survival in these harsh alpine conditions has been hypothesised to be the cause of   the generalist behaviour of kea, leading to their heightened explorative behaviour and curiosity.   Kea are also widely regarded as being extraordinarily intelligent. It is their intelligence that   suggests that kea may possess a sophisticated communication system.       I conducted a study exploring the potentially complex vocal repertoire of the kea. My study   was conducted with wild population of banded juvenile and fledgling kea in Aoraki/Mount   Cook National Park between February 2003 and April 2004. I obtained 449 vocalisations from   16 identified and several unidentified kea.       The results of this study confirmed that the vocal repertoire of the kea is exceptionally large for   a parrot species, encompassing over 17 vocalisations. This study revealed five vocalisations   previously undescribed in the kea repertoire and showed for the first time that vocal repertoire   of immature kea may be different to the repertoire of adult kea. Two possible gender specific   vocalisations were also revealed. The study of apparent vocal responses revealed that kea   appear to be able to identify vocalisation types and respond accordingly using combinations of   increasingly complex vocalisations. This is also the first study to take advantage of the   similarity between human and parrot vocal systems for the kea, by utilizing powerful human   speech analysis software. The results of this analysis allowed the identification of subtle   differences in kea vocalisations, including the presence of graded signals, not identifiable by   use of spectrogram analysis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kea; nestor notabilis; vocal communication; animal behaviour;</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">7,8-Dihydroneopterin-mediated protection of low density lipoprotein, but not human macrophages, from oxidative stress</field><field name="creator">Firth, Carole Anne</field><field name="description">Any lipoproteins and cells present in the inflammatory environment of atherosclerotic  plaques are likely to be exposed to high levels of oxidative stress. As 7,8-dihydroneopterin  (7,8-NP) is synthesized by interferon-&#206;&#179; (IFN-&#206;&#179;)-activated macrophages, this  pteridine is also thought to exist at sites of inflammation. 7,8-NP s in vivo role remains  controversial, but numerous in vitro studies have identified a radical scavenging  activity. The possibility of 7,8-NP protecting against oxidative damage in inflammatory  environments like plaque was investigated in this thesis. Both human monocyte-derived  macrophages (HMDMs) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were used as substrates.  The extent of protein hydroperoxide formation in each model, and 7,8-NP s effect on  this process, were specifically studied since most previous research has focussed on  lipid rather than protein peroxidation.  For the first time, neopterin (including oxidized 7,8-NP) was also directly detected  by high performance liquid chromatography in the inflammatory environments of 19  pus and two atherosclerotic plaque samples. Peak concentrations even reached the low  micromolar range. The positive correlation identified in the pus between neopterin and a  well known antioxidant, vitamin E, further hinted at a potential antioxidant function.  However, no significant association was noted between neopterin and markers of  protein or lipid oxidation.  Exposure of HMDMs to the AAPH peroxyl radical generator resulted in significant  quantities of lipid hydroperoxides but not protein hydroperoxides, as detected by the  FOX assays. This is likely due to the large accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acidrich  lipid in the primary HMDMs during differentiation in 10% human serum and is of  relevance to atherosclerotic plaque, where macrophages also become lipid-loaded. The  addition of up to 200&#206;&#188;M 7,8-NP failed to prevent AAPH-induced lipid peroxidation and  was also unable to inhibit a loss of cellular thiols or viability. This lack of effect  suggests the damaging peroxyl radicals are not being scavenged by 7,8-NP. The high  lipid content of HMDM cells appears to cause the AAPH and/or 7,8-NP to localize to a  cellular site, where they are unable to interact.  Macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL in iron(II)-supplemented Hams F10 was  associated with the formation of 30-40 moles of protein hydroperoxides per mole of  LDL. The close parallel between protein and lipid peroxidation supports the theory that  lipid-derived radicals are involved in protein hydroperoxide formation on LDL and  indicates that protein hydroperoxides are an early product of LDL oxidation. Their  detection during exposure of LDL to both the THP-1 macrophage cell line and primary  HMDM cells confirms that protein hydroperoxides are also a normal consequence of  macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation.  Incubation of LDL with micromolar 7,8-NP prevented macrophage-mediated  protein hydroperoxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Lipid oxidation  and vitamin E loss were similarly inhibited by 7,8-NP during the cell-mediated attack  of LDL. Kinetic analysis revealed protection due to extension of the lag phase, with  7,8-NP depletion and initiation of the propagation phase coinciding. This supports a  radical scavenging activity for 7,8-NP, resulting in protection of the entire LDL particle.  By contrast, the release of nanomolar quantities of 7,8-NP by IFN-&#206;&#179;-stimulated THP-1  macrophages failed to prevent LDL oxidation. HMDMs activated by IFN-&#206;&#179; did  significantly inhibit LDL oxidation, including protein hydroperoxide formation, for up  to 48 hours but this antioxidant effect was not due to the de novo synthesis of 7,8-NP.  These results indicate that both the prevalence of protein hydroperoxides, and the  ability of 7,8-NP to act as an antioxidant, depend on the system under investigation.  Neopterin exists in inflammatory environments but, considering the lack of protection  against AAPH-mediated HMDM oxidation and the 7,8-NP concentration required to  inhibit macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation, strong evidence for an antioxidant activity  of 7,8-NP in atherosclerotic plaque is currently lacking.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">7</field><field name="subject">8-dihydroneopterin</field><field name="subject">low density lipoprotein</field><field name="subject">macrophage</field><field name="subject">oxidation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isothiocyanate induction of apoptosis in cells overexpressing Bcl-2</field><field name="creator">Brown, Kristin Kate</field><field name="description">The oncogenic protein Bcl-2 is overexpressed in many cancers and prevents cells  from undergoing apoptosis in response to traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Recent  research has focussed on the development of novel agents that can disrupt the  function of Bcl-2 and trigger apoptosis in cancer cells. The isothiocyanates are a class  of naturally-occurring phytochemical with potential for development as both  chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents. This thesis investigated the ability of  the isothiocyanates to induce apoptosis in cells that overexpressed Bcl-2.  Initially, phenethyl isothiocyanate was shown to be cytotoxic to the Jurkat Tlymphoma  cell line with an LD50 of 7.4 &#181;M. Bcl-2 expression had little protective  effect, and even greater than 50-fold overexpression only increased the LD50 to 15.1  &#181;M. Morphological and biochemical assays indicated that death still occurred by  apoptosis despite overexpression of Bcl-2.  A variety of other isothiocyanates were also screened for cytotoxic activity. While the  isothiocyanate moiety was crucial for induction of apoptosis, the chemistry of the side  chain attached to the isothiocyanate moiety also profoundly influenced the ability of  an isothiocyanate to kill Bcl-2 overexpressing cells. The aromatic isothiocyanates  were generally far more cytotoxic than aliphatic isothiocyanates. However, within the  aromatic isothiocyanates tested in this study the length of the carbon linker group,  between the phenyl ring and the isothiocyanate moiety, also influenced cytotoxic  activity. Phenethyl isothiocyanate was identified as the most promising compound  when targeting cells that overexpressed Bcl-2. Given that minor structural alterations  significantly altered cytotoxic activity it is hypothesised that specific interactions with  cellular targets may mediate induction of apoptosis by the isothiocyanates.  Finally, using a sensitive proteomic technique to label oxidised thiol proteins a  preliminary investigation of the targets of the isothiocyanates was performed. A  number of thiol proteins were selectively modified following exposure to phenethyl  isothiocyanate. One thiol protein that consistently changed was identified as  mitochondrial peroxiredoxin-3. Changes to the oxidation state of peroxiredoxin-3  occurred well before activation of apoptosis and may play a role in mediating  induction of apoptosis in cells that overexpress Bcl-2.  The results of this thesis have provided a platform to permit further investigation of  the chemotherapeutic potential of the isothiocyanates and investigation of the  mechanisms that allow the isothiocyanates to induce apoptosis in cells that  overexpress the oncogene Bcl-2. In the future, the identification of primary targets of  the isothiocyanates may aid the design and testing of novel anticancer drugs, and it  will also provide novel insight into the regulation of apoptosis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">isothiocyanate</field><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Bcl-2</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Betaine Homocysteine Methyltransferase, Disease and Diet:  The Use of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  on Biological Methylamines</field><field name="creator">Lee, Martin Bryce</field><field name="description">Homocysteine, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is methylated in the liver via the zinc metalloenzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). Established assays for BHMT include a radiochemical assay, a colorometric assay, an HPLC assay and an in vivo microbiological assay. These techniques are either unsuitable for substrate specificity studies, or are unable to give kinetic measurements. BHMT was purified from liver and measured directly and kinetically by a novel &#185;H-NMR spectroscopic assay. The disappearance of substrates and the formation of products are monitored simultaneously. Using 2 mM glycine betaine and homocysteine as substrates in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5) and measuring the production of N,N-dimethylglycine the CV is 6.3% (n = 6) and the detection limit is 6 nkatal. An endpoint assay for BHMT activity was also developed and had CV = 5.3%, n = 6, with a detection limit of 2 nkatal. The NMR spectroscopic assay was used to determine the substrate specificity with a library of alternative substrates. Analysis of betaine analogues with different chain length, &#945;-substitution, substitution of the nitrogen and carboxyl moieties demonstrated that BHMT is inactive if there is any steric crowding of the nitrogen or &#945;-carbon positions. BHMT is capable of using group VI heteroatom betaines as methyl donors, with much faster rates than glycine betaine. For glycine betaine the Km was 0.19 &#177; 0.03 mM with a Vmax of 17 &#177; 0.7 nMol min-1 mg-1. The same assay was used to detect and partially characterise a BHMT activity from hagfish liver that is similar to that of the mammalian enzyme. NMR spectroscopy was adapted for measurements of glycine betaine in urine, along with other medically significant methylamines. These were shown to be valid for clinical use and in animal studies. A novel metabolite of the sulfonium analogue of glycine betaine (methylsulfinylmethanoate) was identified in rats.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Betaine Homocysteine Methyltransferase</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cycling Performance Following Intermittent Hypoxic Training using an Hypoxicator</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Christopher Mark</field><field name="description">Live high - train low altitude camps can enhance endurance power at sea level by 1-2% (Levine &amp; Stray-Gunderson, 1997).  More convenient methods to simulate altitude exposure are now available, but their effects on performance are less well characterized.  In this study, we investigated intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) using an Hypoxicator, a device that produces oxygen-depleted air that athletes breathe intermittently through masks in a small group at a central venue.   Twelve highly-competitive, male cyclists and multi-sport athletes (IHT group) underwent IHT in two, four-week bouts separated by eight weeks. Bout one consisted of 20 one-hour exposures and bout two 18 exposures where normal and low-oxygenated air was breathed in alternating five-minute intervals.  The percentage of oxygen inhaled by the subjects was adjusted to produce an oxygen saturation of the blood of 88-92% in the first week of the study, decreasing to 76-80% (equivalent to an altitude of approximately 6000m) in the final week.  A control group of 13 similar athletes did not use the Hypoxicator.  Performance trials and blood tests were at four-week intervals; there were 3 trials (familiarization and reliability) before use of the Hypoxicator, 3 trials after to determine the effect of simulated altitude, then a second four-week exposure and one more trial.  The measures of performance were mean power in a 16-km time trial on a Kingcycle ergometer (IHT group only) and power in a lactate-threshold test at 3 mmol/L above baseline (both groups).  The measures from the blood tests were haemoglobin and haematocrit.   There was a gradual but erratic improvement in performance in the time trial and lactate threshold tests over the course of the study in both groups, indicating an improvement through training.  Relative to the last baseline test (Trial 3), the IHT group showed a 0.6% decrease in mean power over and above the effect of training in the 16-km time trial in Trial 4, nine days after last use of IHT.  There was a 0.3% increase in mean power independent of the training effect in Trial 7, after the second round of altitude exposure.  Uncertainty in these changes in performance was &#177;3.5% (95% confidence interval).  The changes in lactate threshold in trials 4 and 7 indicate a possible improvement as a result of IHT exposure.  Uncertainty in these changes was &#177;4.0%. There were negligible changes in the haemoglobin and hematocrit of either group at any time.  There was small evidence of high responders, who were probably subjects with the DD genotype for the angiotensin converting enzyme gene.  The time exposed to IHT had no bearing on performance and there was no evidence "peak" in results at either four or eight weeks after exposure to IHT.  In summary, four weeks of IHT exposure probably resulted in a trivial effect on 16-km time-trial performance and the effort-independent measures provided no further clear-cut evidence of a performance improvement.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">altitude</field><field name="subject">simulated altitude</field><field name="subject">intermittent hypoxic training</field><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography, Biomass Production and Effects of Harvesting Giant Kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) in Southern New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Pirker, John Georg</field><field name="description">This study examined the demography of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus)  and its interactions with understorey algae and invertebrates in southern New  Zealand over two and a half years. Most of the study was done at two sites within  Akaroa Harbour (Banks Peninsula) but ancillary sites at Tory Channel (Marlborough  Sounds) were used for parts of the study. The kelp forests within Akaroa Harbour  were generally highly productive, with a high annual turnover of giant kelp.  Macrocystis plants were mostly annual and rarely reached ages greater than 12  months. Peak recruitment occurred in spring (November) during 1995-97, but lesser  recruitment episodes occurred throughout the year. The maximum growth rates of  Macrocystis fronds were comparable to rates reported elsewhere in southern  hemisphere populations (22 mm - 24.5 mmlday), but considerably lower than those  in northern hemisphere populations.  The major experiment incorporated in the study tested the effects of the Macrocystis  canopy and the understorey canopy of the stipitate laminarian Ecklonia radiata on  macroalgae and invertebrates. The experiment was structured so that the effects of  clearances at different times could be determined. One impetus for this experiment  was the need to address issues relating to the commercial harvesting of giant kelp,  its sustainability and its effects on other species. The effects of canopy removals on  understorey algae, mostly juvenile Macrocystis, Ecklonia and Carpophyllum spp,  were highly dependent on the timing of canopy removals and the combinations of  canopies removed. For example, winter harvests of the Macrocystis canopy alone  enhanced the survival of post-settlement Macrocystis recruits, but had little effect on  Ecklonia recruitment. However, when both Macrocystis and Ecklonia canopies were  removed in spring, there was heavy recruitment of Ecklonia that grew to dominate  the understorey. Strong inter and intraspecific interactions from the Macrocystis  surface canopy appeared to have been reduced by physical factors including water  turbidity, sedimentation and the deterioration of the surface canopy during summer.  These physical factors were not as limiting in Tory Channel.  Fine scale extrinsic factor effects including nutrients, light and grazing on the early  life history of Macrocystis were investigated in small experiments. Results suggest  that recruitment may be nutrient limited even at moderately low temperatures, and  that small herbivorous gastropods are an important source of mortality in the early  life stages of Macrocystis. Culturing and transplantation cultivation techniques were  also examined as a means of supplementing algal supplies. Macrocystis was  cultured successfully through its life cycle onto culture ropes, but generally failed to  produce visible sporophytes when placed in the field. Cultured plants did grow in  Tory Channel, however. Juvenile plants transplanted to ropes for on-farm cultivation  showed little growth during summer, but the addition of nutrients significantly  enhanced growth rates of these plants during warmer months when natural nutrient  levels were low. Increased growth rates at the onset of winter and with the addition  of nutrients during summer confirmed that low nutrient levels during summer are  growth limiting.  Akaroa Harbour kelp forests exhibited considerable variation in Macrocystis canopy  biomass through time. For example, the 32,000 m2 kelp forest at Wainui had a  biomass of 144 t in October 1995, which then decreased to 21 t in October 1996.  Canopies tended to deteriorate during summer. Thus, at Ohinepaka Bay kelp forest  had a biomass of 31 t during winter 1997, which decreased to 0.06 t the following  summer. The greatest reduction in biomass, however, coincided with a period of  hugely increased sediment, which smothered blades in the sea-surface canopy,  covered the substratum, and prevented successful recruitment of kelp for over a  year. Nutrient depletion was one of several factors thought to cause the summer  deterioration of the Macrocystis sea-surface canopy, which has important  ramifications for the commercial harvesting of Macrocystis pyrifera in summer.  Management considerations and options are discussed in relation the commercial  harvesting of Macrocystis in New Zealand.  The major conclusion of this study is that although Macrocystis was able to form  dense surface canopies during winter its ability to dominate kelp forests was  constrained by physical factors, especially sedimentation, high turbidity, nutrients,  and storms. The lack of strong interactions between Macrocystis and Ecklonia are  also largely a result of their different life history characteristics. Overall, there appear  to be no significant negative flow-on effects resulting from kelp harvesting and it  appears that Macrocystis can be harvested sustainably.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macrocystis</field><field name="subject">kelp</field><field name="subject">biomass production</field><field name="subject">demography</field><field name="subject">early life history</field><field name="subject">commercial harvest</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Bcl-2 on the cellular response to oxidative stress</field><field name="creator">Cox, Andrew Graham</field><field name="description">Exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide can cause oxidative damage to cellular constituents including lipids, protein, and DNA. At elevated concentrations, hydrogen peroxide can trigger cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. Apoptotic cell death can be prevented by overexpression of the oncoprotein Bcl-2. The exact mechanism by which Bcl-2 blocks cell death is controversial. Some researchers believe that Bcl-2 possesses antioxidant properties that protect cells from apoptosis. The purpose of this thesis was to assess oxidative stress and apoptosis following hydrogen peroxide exposure in Jurkat T cells overexpressing Bcl-2. One of the major objectives was to ascertain whether or not Bcl-2 overexpression elevated the antioxidant capacity of Jurkat T cells to provide protection from oxidant-induced cell death.     Hydrogen peroxide treated Jurkat cells became apoptotic at moderate levels of oxidant (25-100 uM H2O2), and necrotic at higher doses (greater than 200 uM H2O2). Bcl-2 overexpression prevented caspase activation and cell death at the apoptotic doses of H2O2, but not the necrotic doses. Caspase inhibition studies demonstrated that Bcl-2 overexpression provided a greater level of resistance from H2O2-induced cell death than the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk.    A systematic study was carried out examining the antioxidant status of Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2. Several Bcl-2 transfectants were utilised for the study, so that any differences seen could be correlated to the level of Bcl-2 expression. Surprisingly, there were no statistically significant differences among the Bcl-2 transfectants for any of the antioxidant enzymes.     Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 exhibited the same level of oxidative damage to lipids and protein in response to H2O2 exposure as the parental Jurkat cells. Interestingly, Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 continued to grow in culture after H2O2 exposure, despite harboring damage to cellular constituents. Consistent with these results, H2O2 treated Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2, which failed to undergo apoptosis, were more prone to genomic instability.     Together, these findings suggest that Bcl-2 overexpression protects Jurkat cells from H2O2-induced cell death by blocking apoptosis. Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were no better at detoxifying oxidants and showed the same level of oxidative damage following H2O2 exposure. As a result, the overexpression of Bcl-2 considerably enhanced the mutagenicity of H2O2.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bcl-2</field><field name="subject">antioxidant</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">genomic instability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eye movement control and cognition   in Parkinson's disease</field><field name="creator">van Stockum, Eva Saskia</field><field name="description">Many studies have found evidence of abnormal eye movement control in Parkinson's disease. Deficits in the inhibition of unintended saccades and slowed initiation of intentional saccades have been reported in some, but not all, investigations. Also over recent years the presence of cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease has been highlighted. Efficient use of working memory resources is thought to be involved in the performance of tasks in both domains. With a comprehensive selection of saccadic and neuropsychological tasks, the current study investigated whether aspects of abnormal oculomotor control are associated with impairment of cognitive functions.  Nineteen Parkinson's disease patients and eighteen healthy age matched control subjects performed six eye movement tasks and completed a neuropsychological test battery assessing five different aspects of cognitive functioning.  Deficits were found in both the oculomotor and the cognitive domain in the group of patients.   As a group, the patients made more reflexive errors in antisaccade tasks, more inhibition errors in a delayed response task, and were slower to initiate intentional saccades. The three measures of abnormal oculomotor control were not consistently associated with cognitive impairments or with each other. Longer latencies of correct antisaccades and increased number of errors in a delayed response task were associated with lower scores in different cognitive tests. Reflexive errors in the antisaccade task were not associated with cognitive deficits, but with the tendency to produce very fast visually triggered responses. The results suggest that, at least in Parkinson's disease, different neural mechanisms may be involved in specific aspects of abnormal oculomotor control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eye movements</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Almost certain loss: the psychology of pyramid schemes</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Alexander Iain</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates investing in pyramid schemes. Study 1 explored the relationships between people s perceptions of investment options and their investment decisions. These options included a bank, a pyramid scheme, stock market and a safe. In this study, participants imagined they could invest money in any of the options and rated their perceptions of each option on various scales. When investing money, participants invested larger amounts in the options that they rated more positively. Compared to other investors, pyramid investors had higher positive correlations between their ratings of the pyramid scheme and how much money they invested. In Study 2 participants indicated how much money they would invest in each option and how risky they perceived the investment. As the perceived risk of an investment option increased, people invested less money. However, participants did not identify the pyramid scheme as the most risky option and rated it as being no more or less risky than the stock market. In both Studies 1 and 2 about half of the participants were willing to invest in the pyramid scheme. In Studies 3 and 4, participants imagined they had invested money in a pyramid scheme and were recruiting new target investors. Two experimental conditions were devised. In the first condition, participants were not informed of the potential for monetary loss, whereas in the second condition, monetary loss was made explicit. Potential target investors varied in the closeness of their rated relationship to the participant. When in the early non-loss condition, participants selected targets that were close to themselves, but in the loss condition they favoured targets that were less close. Furthermore, when in the non-loss condition, participants persuaded those targets they were closer to invest, whereas in the loss condition they persuaded them not to invest. Studies 5 and 6 found that there was no difference in sensation seeking propensities or intellect between pyramid scheme investors and non-investors. One clear finding for the research is that many people did not select the pyramid scheme as the poor investment that it is, a result which indicates its present illegal status is justified.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyramid schemes</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">investment</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of intra-ring checking and xylogenesis in Pinus radiata D.Don</field><field name="creator">Nair, Hema</field><field name="description">Pinus radiata is the dominant species of the plantations forests in New Zealand.  The forest industry in New Zealand is heavily dependant on it.  However, Pinus radiata can develop wood quality flaw called 'intra-ring checking'.  The checks or splits appear in wood during kiln drying and usually affect the earlywood region of the wood.  It lowers value of appearance grade timber leading to huge economic loses for the forest industry.  This thesis presents a study that was undertaken as a part of ongoing collaborative work that is being carried out to understand wood quality issues in Pinus radiata, with a vision of improving its wood quality.  This study was a part of that effort and was conducted with an aim to gain an insight into intra-ring checking, and the process of xylogenesis in Pinus radiata.    The investigations for this study were carried out in two steps.  The first step was to understand intra-ring checking.  The location of intra-ring checking was determined by observing the checks using various microscopy techniques.  Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that checking was as an intercell failure that usually occurs at the cm1/S1 boundary.  A comparative study was also conducted to see if the checked wood had some inherent properties that made it more susceptible to checking.  It was found that checking could be influenced by tracheid geometry and cell wall thickness.  If the wood had large tracheids with thin walls, it was more likely to develop checks during drying.  Lignin distribution in the cell wall layers was also seen to play an important role in checking.  Lower lignin levels and disruption in the pattern of lignification of the cell wall layers increased the tendency of the wood to develop checks.  Similarly, it the tracheids have larger pits then their tendency to check increases.  Structural features that disrupt the uniformity of the interlocking pattern of the tracheid such as rays and resin canals could also play a role in checking.  Checked wood tends to have more surface area occupied by ray tissue.  However, resin canals do not seem to be directly involved in checking, though their arrangement could indicate disturbances during xylogenesis.    The second step was to understand the process of xylogenesis in Pinus radiata especially with respect to the influence of auxin and boron on it.  Nutrient and organ culture methods were manipulated and successfully used to study xylogenesis.  An exhaustive comparative study was carried out to observe and measure selected wood properties.  Microscopy and image analysis revealed that auxin and boron changes in the medium led to the alterations in the cell division, expansion and lignification.  However, the analysis of the measurements and the observations displayed complex 'between-tree' and 'within-culture variations'.  Clear trends did not emerge from the analysis hence, a confident conclusion on the association between auxin, boron and lignification could not be drawn from this organ culture study.    The study has added to the knowledge about checking and wood properties associated with it.  A new tool of organ culture had been established that can hlep future research on the process of xylogenesis in Pinus radiata.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plantation</field><field name="subject">forest</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">gymnosperm</field><field name="subject">wood</field><field name="subject">tracheid</field><field name="subject">ultrastructure</field><field name="subject">xylogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the activity and characteristics of  superoxide dismutase  in the male reproductive parts of petunia</field><field name="creator">Moon, Bok Hee</field><field name="description">In the stamen (male reproductive tissue) of petunia 'Hurrah' flowers, the occurrence of SOD (superoxide dismutase) provided an effective anti-oxidative mechanism against superoxide production. Superoxide production and SOD activities at five developmental stages showed a positive correlation. The highest superoxide production and SOD activity in different parts of the stamen (anther, filament and pollen) were at stages with high metabolic activity: (i) during growing buds (in anthers and filaments) (ii) when flowers with predehiscent anthers were fully open (in pollen). In all parts of the stamen, SOD activity was the lowest at stage five (fully open flowers with dehiscent anthers), superoxide production was also lower at this stage with the exception of the pollen. The highest SOD activity was localized in anthers with the pollen, suggesting that the filaments only have a structural support function. SOD was examined on a native PAGE with regard to the isozymes present within the stamen of five developmental stages. Three isozymes, which were identified as Mn SOD, Fe SOD and Cu/Zn SOD by reactions with inhibitors, were commonly found at five developmental stages in crude extracts of anthers, filaments and pollen. The developmental stages with stronger isozyme bands on the native PAGE were consistent with the stages with higher SOD activities, and the Mn SOD and Fe SOD isozyme bands were more intense than Cu/Zn SOD bands, suggesting the activities of Mn SOD and Fe SOD in the crude extracts were much higher than Cu/Zn SOD. SOD from 1,000 stamens of dehiscent mature flowers was partially purified using ammonium sulphate fractionation and DEAE cellulose column chromatography. The purified bound fraction contained only one SOD isozyme on a native PAGE, which was shown to be a Mn SOD, as it is sensitive to neither hydrogen peroxide nor cyanide. The specific activity of the purified SOD was 66.5 U/mg and the yield of total activity was 3.0%. The progress of enzyme purification was monitored using SDS-PAGE and the bound fraction contained two major polypeptide bands. The purified enzyme activity was optimal in the range of neutral pH, but it was the highest at pH 7.8. Through incubation at various pH levels for 24 hours, favourable stability of the purified fraction was confirmed around a pH range of 7 to 8.5. The purified enzyme retained 87% of its initial activity at -20 ? after one month of storage, but at 4 ? only 38% of the initial activity remained after the same period of storage.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">superoxide</field><field name="subject">superoxide dismutase</field><field name="subject">anti-oxidative mechanism</field><field name="subject">SOD isozymes</field><field name="subject">enzyme purification</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural plasticity of life history traits in the New Zealand avifauna</field><field name="creator">Starling, Amanda</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to determine how predator control influences nest survival and changes in life history strategies of birds.  All studies were conducted at two sites: one site had very little mammal control, while the other site is a 'mainland island' in which all introduced mammals were trapped or poisoned.  Nest survival rates of introduced and native species were compared between the two sites by locating and monitoring nests of nine species.  I found that mammalian predator control increased nest survival rates of both introduced and native species, but the incrase of nest survival was more pronounced in native species.  The influence of predator control on the plasticity of life history strategies in introduced and native New Zealand birds was also examined.  Some life history strategies (e.g. time spent incubating, frequency of visits to the nest) changed significantly in the area with predator control, while other life history traits (e.g. clutch size) did not vary between areas.  I found that both introduced and native New Zealand birds changed a variety of life history traits and that the changes were likely a plastic response to the recent change in predator numbers.  As it has been suggested that birds may become less responsive to mammals when predators are controlled, I tested the response of birds to a model of a feral cat.  Birds in the predator control area were significantly less likely to recognise the cat model as a potential threat.  This suggests the recognition of predators can be rapidly lost from a population.    My research confirms that mammal control can increase nest success of native species, but reductions in predator numbers can also change a variety of life history traits and behaviours.  As the removal of mammalian predators also appears to make birds less responsive to potential predators, it is important for continued mammalian control once management has begun.  Otherwise, any reintroduction of predatory mammals into controlled sites would likely place such bird populations at greater risk as they would have behaviours suited to an environment with lowered nest predation risk.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">predator</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">nest survival</field><field name="subject">life history</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">native</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of assays for coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K, and their application in clinical trials</field><field name="creator">Molyneux, Sarah Lee</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of separate assays to measure coenzyme Q&#8321;&#8320; (CoQ&#8321;&#8320;) and vitamin K. Coenzyme Q is essential for the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and vitamin K for the blood coagulation cascade. Vitamin K deficiency is associated with haemorrhagic disease of the new-born, and CoQ&#8321;&#8320; deficiency with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy and heart failure. Coenzyme Q and vitamin K are usually measured by HPLC, using electrochemical and ultraviolet, and electrochemical and fluorescence detection, respectively. For vitamin K1, the limit of detection achieved using fluorescence and electrochemical detection was 0.28 and 0.12 nmol/L, respectively. Sensitivity of fluorescence detection is improved by using protic solvents in the mobile phase, and platinum-black catalysed alcohol reduction. The lipophilicity and low endogenous concentrations of vitamin K1 hinder its measurement, and further work is required to produce a rapid, reliable and robust assay for its measurement in human plasma. The limits of detection achieved using fluorescence, ultraviolet and electrochemical detection to measure CoQ&#8321;&#8320; were 29, 4.8, and 0.34 nmol/L, respectively. Plasma CoQ&#8321;&#8320; is not stable during long term storage at -13 &#8451;, but at -80 &#8451; it is stable for at least 18 months. The reference interval for plasma total CoQ&#8321;&#8320; in the New Zealand population is 0.47 - 1.80 &#181;mol/L. There is no clinical requirement for stratification of the reference interval according to gender. Coenzyme Q&#8321;&#8320; in human plasma is homeostatically controlled, varying little over a two month interval in healthy young males. Coenzyme Q&#8321;&#8320; supplements have significantly different bioavailability, with the median increase in plasma CoQ&#8321;&#8320; ranging from 0.14 to 0.59 &#181;mol/L for seven different supplement brands. There is a large inter-individual variation in CoQ&#8321;&#8320; absorption, and hence plasma concentrations should be monitored during supplementation. A plateau in CoQ&#8321;&#8320; absorption, from a single dose, at approximately 200 mg suggests that the maximum dose ingested at one time should be 200 mg or less. Q-Gel capsules containing 30 mg of CoQ&#8321;&#8320; are twice as effective at raising blood CoQ&#8321;&#8320; as 100 mg capsules. Plasma CoQ&#8321;&#8320; in patients with chronic heart failure are significantly lowered by approximately 33% when these patients receive Atorvastatin for six weeks. The absolute decrease in CoQ&#8321;&#8320; showed a significant correlation with worsening endothelial function (r = + 0.548, p = 0.011). Coenzyme Q&#8329; was shown to be present in human plasma with a reference interval of 8.8 - 47.0 nmol/L.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coenzyme Q10</field><field name="subject">ubiquinone</field><field name="subject">vitamin K</field><field name="subject">HPLC</field><field name="subject">clinical trial</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computational Investigation of the Biosynthesis of Lanosterol</field><field name="creator">Townsend, Michael Arthur Edward</field><field name="description">The biosynthesis of the steroid precursor molecule lanosterol is a remarkable process in which the enzyme-bound substrate 2,3-S-oxidosqualene forms four new carbocyclic rings by a cascade of cation-alkene addition reactions, followed by a series of 1,2-methyl and hydride shifts. The work presented in this thesis is a computational study of the reactions of compounds designed to model the oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclisation in order to establish details of the mechanism of this amazing cyclisation. The initiation of oxidosqualene cyclisation has been modelled by the intermolecular reaction of protonated oxirane and methylpropene. The SN2-like ring opening of the protonated epoxide is strongly exothermic with a low barrier to reaction; the geometry of the gas phase reaction has been found to be significantly affected by hyperconjugative stabilisations and low energy steric interactions. The energy profile and geometry of this reaction can now be compared to analogous intramolecular reactions such as the formation of the lanosterol A-ring. The competing five- and six-membered cyclisations of a series of substituted A-ring model compounds was investigated. It has been found that the facile cleavage of the protonated epoxide causes the reaction to behave more as an electrophilic addition than as a nucleophilic ring-opening substitution. This behaviour accounts for the general preference of protonated epoxides to react at the more substituted carbon atom, while epoxides in neutral or basic media react at the least sterically hindered carbon. With consideration for Baldwin's rules for ring closure, it is seen that the series of model compounds generally favours six-membered ring formation endo at the epoxide. The formation of the lanosterol B-ring was studied using a bicyclic model system. Previous computational studies had predicted the B-ring to close with readily with an activation energy of less than 1 kcal mol-1, however the present study has found a significant barrier to cyclisation of ca. 5-7 kcal mol-1 in this gas-phase model at the HF/6-31G(d) level of theory. This barrier is thought to arise from the closure of the B-ring in a sterically hindered twist-boat conformation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lanosterol biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">molecular modelling</field><field name="subject">reaction mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Diels-Alder</field><field name="subject">epoxide ring-opening</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectrometry and Chemometrics for Quantitative Analysis of Trace Pharmaceuticals on Surfaces</field><field name="creator">Perston, Benjamin Blair</field><field name="description">Cleaning validation, in which cleaned surfaces are analysed for residual material, is an important process in pharmaceutical manufacturing and research facilities. Current procedures usually consist of either swab or rinse-water sampling followed by analysis of the samples. The analysis step is typically either rapid but unselective (conductivity, pH, total organic carbon, etc.), or selective but time-consuming (HPLC). This thesis describes the development of an in situ surface-spectroscopic analysis that removes the need for swab sampling and is both rapid and selective. This method has the potential to complement existing analyses to increase the efficiency of cleaning-validation protocols. The spectrometric system consists of a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer coupled to a fibre-optic grazing-angle reflectance probe, and allows the measurement of infrared reflection-absorbance spectra (IRRAS) from flat surfaces in ~10 s. Multivariate chemometric methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, are used to exploit the high information content of infrared spectra to obtain selective analyses without physical separation of the analyte or analytes from whatever interfering species may be present. Multivariate chemometric models require considerably more effort for calibration and validation than do traditional univariate techniques. This thesis details suitable methods for preparing calibration standards by aerosol deposition, optimising and validating the model by cross- and test-set validation, and estimating the uncertainty by resampling and formula-based approaches. Successful calibration models were demonstrated for residues of acetaminophen, a model active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), on glass surfaces. The root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) was ~0.07 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;. Simultaneous calibration for acetaminophen and aspirin, another API, gave a similar RMSEP of 0.06 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178; for both compounds, demonstrating the selectivity of the method. These values correspond to detection limits of ~0.2 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;, well below the accepted visual detection limit of ~1-4 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;. The sensitivity of the method with a stainless steel substrate was found to depend strongly on the surface finish, with highly polished surfaces giving more intense IRRAS. RMSEP values of 0.04- 0.05 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178; were obtained for acetaminophen on stainless steel with three different finishes. For this system, severe nonlinearity was encountered for loadings 1.0 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;. From the results presented in this thesis, it is clear that IRRAS has potential utility in cleaning validation as a complement to traditional techniques.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">FTIR</field><field name="subject">reflection-absorption spectrometry</field><field name="subject">chemometrics</field><field name="subject">pharmaceutical cleaning validation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assembly of organic layers onto carbon surfaces</field><field name="creator">Tan, Emelyn Sue Qing</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the study of organic layers covalently assembled onto carbon surfaces. As a result of their attachment, the properties of carbon surfaces were controllably adjusted so that these surfaces could be used for desired applications. In order that a wide range of properties were imparted onto the carbon surface, many different modifiers were attached and thoroughly characterised. Three applications that the modified carbon surfaces were used for were the subsequent coupling of molecular species, adsorption of protein and assembly of aldehyde/sulfate-functionalised polystyrene (PS) and citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (NPs). Finally, patterning of different organic layers at pre-determined spatially defined locations on the one carbon surface was also investigated. The carbon surfaces used in this work were glassy carbon (GC) and pyrolysed photoresist film (PPF) surfaces. For PPF, methods for the reproducible fabrication of electrochemically suitable surfaces were investigated. The properties of GC and PPF surfaces are very similar apart from the surface roughness. PPF has near atomic smoothness and has RMS roughness values that are approximately four times smaller than GC. The first series of modifier layers attached to the carbon surfaces was via the oxidation of seven different primary amines. The different layers allowed the modulation of the wettability of the surface. Both n-tridecylamine (TDA, monoamine) and 1,12-diaminododecane (DAD, diamine) are able to form multilayers. The stability of TDA and DAD layers were tested by scanning, soaking and sonicating the layers in different media. Changes in the layer were monitored by the probe response of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FCA). However, atomic force microscope (AFM) depth profiling experiments showed that changes in the probe response did not indicate cleavage of the covalently attached layer and mechanisms are proposed to account for the changes in the response of the probe. Surface concentrations of the amine modifiers were estimated by the coupling of an electrochemically active species, FCA and nitrobenzoyl chloride (NBC). The electrochemical reduction of the 4-nitrophenylethylamine (NPEA) layer in acid caused the layer to 'shrink'. Surface concentration estimates of NPEA from acid reduction of layers with different thicknesses suggested that only a limited fraction of the p-nitrophenyl groups were reduced in acid. However, in ACN (acetonitrile)/0.1 M [Bu4N]BF4 (tetrabutyl ammonium fluoroborate) the relationship between the concentration of electroactive surface groups and layer thickness was linear. The other series of modifiers that was attached to alter the surface properties was performed by the reduction of aryl diazonium salts. Subsequent coupling reactions of tetraethylene glycol diamine (TGD) to para methylene carboxylic acid phenyl (MCA) and NBC to electrochemically reduced para nitro phenyl (NPh) layers were carried out. Surface concentrations of NPh as estimated from reduction scans was higher when reduction was performed in ethanol/water compared to acid. Four peaks at N1s binding energies were observed in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra for both acid and ethanol/water reduced layers. The ability of attached amine and aryl layers to modulate the adsorption of protein was investigated using fluorescently labelled protein, bovine serum albumin-fluorescein isothiocynate (BSA-FITC) and fluorescence microscopy. TGD, para methyl phenyl (MP), para hexyl phenyl (HP) and para polyethylene glycol phenyl (PEG)-modified GC surfaces promoted protein adsorption relative to as-prepared GC, whereas n-hexylamine (HA) and polyethylene glycol diamine (PGD) layers reduced protein adsorption. The assembly of two types of NPs, aldehyde/sulfate-functionalised PS and citrate-capped gold NPs, onto amine-containing modifiers layers was examined. Citrate-capped gold NPs were synthesised and characterised. The surface coverage of the gold NPs was controlled by using different modifiers of different chemical compositions, tuning the modification conditions and adjusting the immersion time, concentration and pH of gold NP solution. Approaches to creating patterns of modifiers in pre-determined spatially defined locations on GC and PPF surfaces using poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS), poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVA) and thin metal films were investigated. With the "fill-in" approach using PDMS, the smallest pattern of modifiers was the parallel lines with a line width of 20 &#181;m and straight edges and was created by performing electrochemistry in PDMS microchannels which has not been previously investigated. Visualisation techniques, based on optical and scanning electron microscopy, were demonstrated for the molecular patterns.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surfaces</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">amines</field><field name="subject">aryl diazoniums</field><field name="subject">nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">patterning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of landscape heterogeneity and clearfell harvest size on beetle (Coleoptera) biodiversity in plantation forests</field><field name="creator">Pawson, Stephen</field><field name="description">Compared to natural forests, fast-growing plantations of exotic species such as Pinus radiata are often perceived as marginal habitat or unsuitable habitat for most native species. By  studying Coleoptera (beetles) in a variety of landscape elements (pasture, native forest and  different aged Pinus radiata stands) in a highly modified and fragmented landscape in New  Zealand I aimed to determine the value of exotic plantation forests for native biodiversity, and  how these species are affected by different sized clearfell harvest areas.  Pitfall trap sampling of beetles showed that plantation forest stands can provide suitable  complimentary habitat to native forest for many species. Rarefied species richness of  Carabidae, Scarabaeidae and Scolytinae was not significantly different between habitats,  however, habitat types differed significantly in their beetle community composition.  Comparing different production habitats, Pinus radiata stands had a beetle community  composition most similar to native forest. However, a small minority of species, e.g.,  Dichrochile maura, were restricted to native forest habitat highlighting the importance of  retaining indigenous ecosystems within plantations. Unlike human modified habitats, native  forests did not provide suitable habitat for exotic species.  Clearfell harvesting is controversial and its impact on biodiversity is a key constraint for  many forest certification programs, such as that administered by the Forest Stewardship  Council (FSC). Despite this, no replicated manipulative experimental studies of the impact of  different sized clearfell harvest areas on biodiversity have been undertaken at scales relevant  to the New Zealand forest industry. One potential model of the impact of different clearfell  harvest sizes is the concept of a threshold size. A threshold scenario may occur where  clearfell harvest impacts increase at a rate disproportionate to the change in clearfell size over  a small range of harvest areas, but impacts remain relatively unchanged either side of the  threshold zone. I sampled Coleoptera in experimentally created 0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50 and  500 ha clearfells within Pinus radiata plantations in the central North Island of New Zealand.  The wide range of clearfell harvest sizes, including some very small areas, such as 0.01 ha  was instigated in an attempt to document potential clearfell harvest size thresholds.  Rarefied native beetle species richness was higher in harvest areas compared to adjacent  mature plantation stands. The beetle species richness in 5 ha and 500 ha harvest areas was  significantly greater species than that in small 0.01 - 0.5 ha harvest areas. Although, the high  beetle diversity recorded in 500 ha clearfells should be treated with caution due to  confounding spatial autocorrelation. The degree of change in beetle community composition  increased with increasing clearfell harvest area. Beetle assemblages in large harvest areas  were less similar to their paired adjacent mature forest than smaller harvest areas. Although,  constrained multivariate ordination techniques did show a short-term change in beetle species  composition between recently clearfelled harvest areas of as little as 0.05 ha and adjacent  mature P. radiata stands. The colonisation by open-habitat disturbance-adapted species was a  key driver of this change, some species dispersed into clearfelled stands in significant  densities within days post-harvest. Overall, there were no distinct short-term trends to the  change in species richness as a function of increasing harvest area that would suggest an  ecological impact threshold response.  If short-term outcomes of clearfell harvesting are ameliorated by successful recolonisation,  the long-term spatial arrangement of different aged stands becomes more important for the  maintenance of biodiversity at the landscape level than short-term consequences of  harvesting. By sampling selected beetle taxa in 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 26 year-old stands, I found  that the abundance of seven out of eight of the species selected for analysis recovered to  levels similar to those in adjacent mature forest within the timeframe of a single harvest  rotation. Individual species utilised different aged stands, indicating different life-history  strategies. For example, open-habitat, disturbance-adapted species such as Cicindela  tuberculata and Sitona discoideus were prominent in young stands, and forest species such as  Pycnomerus sophorae and Paracatops phyllobius were highly abundant in older stands. These  alternative life-history strategies highlight the benefits of maintaining a mixture of different  aged stands to increase biodiversity at the landscape level.  This thesis fills an important gap in our knowledge of biodiversity in production landscapes. I show that plantation forests have value as complimentary habitat to native forest and they make an important contribution to the maintenance of biodiversity at the landscape level. Although clearfell harvesting is a severe disturbance to the forest ecosystem, the long-term  recovery of beetle populations suggests that harvesting is not the key limiting factor to the  enhancement of biodiversity in the plantation forests studied. This unusual situation is  possibly the result of prior land-use history, as many plantations were established on degraded  pastoral land, and harvest-sensitive species are unlikely to have survived this initial land-use  change. As such, the severity of the long-term impacts of clearfell harvesting on biodiversity  are likely to be context specific and will vary accordingly.  The importance of spatial heterogeneity of habitat elements, including different aged  plantation stands and native forest remnants, needs to be investigated in more detail to  determine what limits biodiversity in this plantation landscape. Key points to consider are the  proximity to, and proportion of, native forest cover in the landscape and the degree of  connectivity among native remnants. It is these landscape-level attributes that may determine  biodiversity at a regional scale, and more emphasis should be placed on landscape scale  factors and there interaction with stand specific forest management practices. For example,  the spatial mosaic of harvesting areas may need to be of a finer-scale when there are fewer  native remnants within the landscape.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plantation forestry</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">clearfell harvesting</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Coleoptera</field><field name="subject">harvest area</field><field name="subject">ecological thresholds</field><field name="subject">landscape ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the chemistry of fungal natural products</field><field name="creator">van der Sar, Sonia</field><field name="description">Natural products as sources of novel therapeutic agents experienced a steady increase from around the turn of the twentieth century until it peaked in the 1970s and 1980s. However since this time pharmaceutical research in natural products has experienced a decline.  Despite this trend the natural products industry now seems to be experiencing a revival of sorts.    This thesis represents a continuation of the work on the isolation and structure elucidation of potential drug leads from terrestrial fungal sources that the natural products group at the University of Canterbury is engaged in.    The known compound, pseurotin A (2.7) and two novel diastereomers, pseurotin A2 (2.8) and pseurotin A3 (2.9) were isolated from the extract of a Penicillium sp. of fungus collected from the foreshore of a beach in Vancouver, Canada.  The absolute stereochemistry of pseurotin A2 and proposed absolute stereochemistry for A3 were elucidated using a combination of X-ray crystallography (A2 only), circular dichrosim, oxidative cleavage reactions, and J2-resoved 2D NMR experiments.    The extract of an as yet unidentified endophytic fungus has yielded eight novel compounds related to the spirobisnaphthalene class of compounds.  These eight compounds fall into to distinct groupings.  The spiro-mamakones, distinguished by a structurally unprecedented oxygenated spiro-nonene skeleton, comprise five compounds, spiro-mamakones A-E (3.11, 3.15-3.18).  In addition to these naturally occurring compounds, the semi-synthetic compounds, 4-oxo-spiro-mamakone A (3.12) and O-acetyl-spiro-mamakone A (3.21), were also synthesised.  spiro-Mamakone A was found to be racemic, while X-ray crystallography and optical rotation revealed spiro-mamakone C (3.15) to be present as an enantiomeric mixture (4S*, 5S*, 9R*).  Unfortunately the enantiomeric excess was unable to be elucidated.  NOE experiments revealed spiro-mamakone B (3.16) to have the relative stereochemistry 4S*, 5S*, 9S*.  The relative stereochemistry of spiro-mamakones D (3.17) (4S*, 5S*, 8S*, 9S*) and E (3.18) (4S*, 5S*, 8S*, 9R*) was proposed from comparison of coupling constant calculations from energy-minimised models with those of the experimentally determined values. The second group, comprising three novel compounds named the mamakunoic acids, mamakunoic acid A-C (3.8, 3.7, 3.10), are characterised by their acid substituted dihydro benzofuran system.  The low yield obtained of these compounds, unfortunately prevented their stereochemical elucidation.    In addition to structure elucidation, biosynthetic studies on spiro-mamakone A and mamakunoic acid B were also carried out.  Analysis of the NMR spectra derived from spiro-mamakone A, labelled with isotopic acetate, revealed a situation complicated by the presence of isotopomers and racemisation, resulting in NMR spectra that were somewhat anomalous in appearance.  These irregularities however, were resolved leading to the proposal that spiro-mamakone A was derived from a dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) intermediate, which proceeds through to spiro-mamakone via an epoxide intermediate.  Despite problems with purity and low yields of isotopically labelled mamakunoic acid B, it was proposed that like spiro-mamakone A, it proceeded via a DHN intermediate.    The extract derived from a Malaysian Scleroderma sp. was found to contain a new dichlorinated pulvinic acid derivative, methyl-3',5'-dichloro-4,4'-di-O-methylatromentate (4.14), the structure of which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.  In addition three previously reported compounds, 4,4'-dimethoxyvulpinic acid (4.11), methyl-3'-chloro-4,4'-di-O-methylatromentate (4.12) and methyl-4,4'-dimethoxyvulpinate (4.13), were also isolated.    The extract of another, as yet unidentified endophytic fungus was found to contain the new acetogenin, 1,5-dihydroxy-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methoxyacetophenone (5.7), differing from the known compound, 2,4-dihydroxy-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methoxyacetophenone (5.8) only by virtue of the substitution pattern.  The structure of 5.7 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.  The implementation of efficient dereplication procedures is paramount for those working in the field of natural products.  The recent advances that have been made in the dereplication process in the natural products group at the University of Canterbury are given using examples from this research and where necessary from other group members.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural products</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">spirobisnaphthalenes</field><field name="subject">dihydroxynaphthalene(DHN)</field><field name="subject">polyketide</field><field name="subject">fungi</field><field name="subject">endophyte</field><field name="subject">dereplication</field><field name="subject">spiro-mamakone</field><field name="subject">mamakunoic acid</field><field name="subject">pseurotin</field><field name="subject">pulvinic acid</field><field name="subject">stable isotope labelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeography of the Cellana limpets of New Zealand:  Investigating Barriers to Marine Dispersal and Historical Biogeography</field><field name="creator">Goldstien, Sharyn Jane</field><field name="description">New Zealand is a continental island surrounded by deep-ocean, with a complex system of currents and oceanographic anomalies that may serve to isolate populations of coastal marine organisms. In particular Cook Strait is a 26 km wide body of water separating the North and South Islands which is characterised by complex interactions of tides and converging water masses. Cook Strait is a geologically recent formation that may also impart an historical influence on the biogeographic distribution of coastal marine taxa. In order to investigate the phylogeographic structure of coastal marine taxa around New Zealand's coastline and to investigate the processes that may contribute toward this genetic structure, I analysed mitochondrial DNA genes from limpet species of the Cellana genus. Phylogenetic analyses of the ribosomal 12S and 16S DNA genes showed that C. ornata may approximate the founding lineage to New Zealand, but these genes were unable to resolve between contrasting biogeographic hypotheses about the origin of Cellana in New Zealand. Intraspecific analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from populations throughout the biogeographic range of Cellana ornata, C. radians and C. flava showed concordant genetic discontinuity at Cook Strait. Further analyses suggest that allopatric fragmentation and restricted gene flow have caused significant genetic differentiation between populations of the North and South Island. Demographic expansion was also identified for C. radians. The influence of contemporary nearshore currents and sea surface temperature was assessed using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for C. radians and C. ornata. Low levels of genetic differentiation between populations corresponding to 'current-zones' suggests that contemporary oceanic processes may be contributing to the genetic pattern observed for these species. However, the shallow divergence between haplotypes and populations restricted thorough investigation of contemporary gene flow. Genealogical concordance across co-distributed marine taxa of New Zealand also lends support to the historic association of genetic and species discontinuities with recent geological changes, such as sea level fluctuations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">mollusc</field><field name="subject">marine biogeography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Has Mortality Become Geographically Polarised in New Zealand?  A Case Study: 1981-2000</field><field name="creator">Tisch, Catherine Frances</field><field name="description">In the New Zealand context, considerable academic and government attention has been given to the socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in health, and how they have evolved over time. Despite evidence of clear regional health patterning within New Zealand, there has been very little research monitoring how the geographical trends in health have evolved over time. The period 1980 to 2001 is very important in New Zealand's contemporary history, as it was a time of rapid social and economic change. For this reason, researchers are motivated to examine the extent to which health differentials evolved during the same period. The reduction of health inequalities are at the top of the Government's health agenda, it is therefore important not only to monitor the success, or otherwise, of a reduction in social inequalities, but also, geographic inequalities. This thesis examines the extent of geographic inequalities in mortality in contemporary New Zealand, and whether or not mortality has become geographically polarised between 1981 and 2000. This thesis builds on research carried out in New Zealand, and seeks to delve deeper into the specifics of the geographic variation of mortality. Importantly, it fills several knowledge gaps during this period, which include: the geographic inequality of cause-specific mortality, the difference in regional cause-specific mortality between males and females, and the inequalities of mortality at a finer geographic resolution. A significant debate revolves around the relative contribution of compositional and contextual explanations for the geographic variation of health outcomes. The research undertaken in this thesis examines the contribution of population change and deprivation to the geographic inequalities of mortality. Numerous key findings were identified in this research, four of which are as follows: In 2000, significant geographic inequalities in cause-specific mortality existed within New Zealand; between 1981 and 2000 the geographic mortality gap remained relatively stable; and when the geographic areas are sorted by deprivation, the results indicate that there has been a widening of the mortality gap. Analysis of the relationship between population change and mortality provide cautious support for the finding that mortality rates are higher in areas that have experienced population decline and conversely, that mortality rates are lower in areas where there has been a growth in population. The high and stable levels of geographic inequality should be of great concern to policy makers as the results of this research indicate that policies addressing health inequalities in New Zealand are not sufficiently potent.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">health inequalities</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="subject">cause-specific mortality</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community development in El Mirador, Nicaragua, post Hurricane Mitch:   NGO involvement and community cohesion</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson, Rewa Helen</field><field name="description">In October of 1998 the category 5 storm, Hurricane Mitch, struck Nicaragua, leaving in its wake mass destruction and devastation. Numerous aid agencies and social organisations poured funds into the country to assist in emergency disaster relief efforts, and to rebuild the lives of those who lost their homes and livelihoods (damnificados). El Mirador in the city of Matagalpa is one example of the many communities built with aid monies after Hurricane Mitch. This thesis uses qualitative data constructed from in-depth interviews with participants (community members in El Mirador) to understand the level of successful community development that has been achieved, the ability for longer term sustainability as a result of community development strategies, and the areas in which community development has failed. Through an examination of the relationship the community has with the NGO the Communal Movement, the question of long term sustainability becomes important. The most telling indicator (that development practice is unsustainable) is the unproductive coping mechanisms of community members as aid and social organisations withdraw leaving members with ineffective social networks and at times uncooperative behaviour. Added into this is the arrival of new members into the community, and squatters, who have only added to the feelings of segregation already apparent, as a 'them and us' mentality develops. This study provides a detailed case specific analysis of community development through disaster relief efforts. It highlights some of the consistent, broad inefficiencies as well as more location and situation specific difficulties of community development. Moreover, it adds to the growing body of literature researching how disaster relief can become more effective and sustainable in the longer term.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community development</field><field name="subject">El Mirador</field><field name="subject">Nicaragua</field><field name="subject">Hurricane Mitch</field><field name="subject">NGO involvement</field><field name="subject">community cohesion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological effects of Ulva lactuca L. in  Avon-Heathcote Estuary</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Gerry</field><field name="description">Macroalgal blooms are increasing world-wide and have negative effects on benthic invertebrates and sediments. These include loss of species diversity and development of hostile sediment environments. This thesis considers ecological effects of Ulva lactuca L., and its mechanical removal on benthic invertebrates and sediments in Avon-Heathcote Estuary, New Zealand. Benthic communities comprised 34 species from 12 groups recorded from seven sites during seasonal general surveys. Dominant groups at each site were Gastropoda and Bivalvia. The most abundant species were Austrovenus stutchburyi, Micrelenchus tenebrosus and Amphibola crenata. Community composition varied significantly between sites, and there were significant site-specific differences in abundances of most species between winter and summer. U. lactuca had the greatest seasonal variation. Several species correlated with U. lactuca biomass, and the strength of correlation for different species varied between sites. There were seasonal changes in sediment physico-chemical variables between sites with greatest change in the silt/clay fraction. The sediment variables silt/clay fraction, dissolved oxygen and temperature correlated with seasonal changes of patterns in benthic community assemblages. A similar study was carried out by Bressington in 2003. In both studies, Bivalvia and Gastropoda were the most abundant groups, with Gastropoda having a higher, and Bivalvia a lower, proportion in the present study compared with 2003. Summer communities were significantly different between the two studies. Compared with 2003 there were higher percentages of sediment pore water and volatile solids present in 2005.  Experimental removal of U. lactuca was conducted by mechanical broom at two sites: an open, exposed central sand flat, and McCormacks Bay, a shallow, sheltered mud flat. Removing U. lactuca had several immediate effects. These included a significant decrease in abundance of mobile epifauna (Micrelenchus tenebrosus and Zeacumantus subcarinatus) and an increase in abundance of infauna, including Arthritica bifurca and Austrovenus stutchburyi. There was no effect of U. lactuca removal on Austrovenus stutchburyi condition and 46 days following removal, invertebrate abundances approached pre-removal levels at each site. U. lactuca removal also caused short-term increases in dissolved oxygen and temperature of pore water. The greatest visual impact of removing U. lactuca was to sediments in McCormacks Bay from trampling.  It was concluded that the variables having the greatest effect on seasonal species  distribution and abundance at each site were temperature and sediment grain size. Differences between the present study and the study in 2003 were due to differences in sampling procedure mainly due to the two different quadrat sizes. Greater accuracy in representing long-term changes in ecosystems would be achieved by using standard sampling protocols. Removal of U. lactuca by mechanical broom was effective and had low impact on benthic invertebrates and physico-chemical variables, but it should be used only in sandy habitats because of severe disturbance to soft-sediment environments. Options for management and control of U. lactuca in Avon-Heathcote Estuary are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ulva lactuca</field><field name="subject">Avon-Heathcote Estuary</field><field name="subject">ecological effects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Climatic influences on the grapevine: a study of viticulture in the Waipara basin</field><field name="creator">Sluys, Shona Lee</field><field name="description">Climate is one of the most important factors influencing where wine grapes can be grown and the quality of wine produced from those grapes. A plants habitat has a profound influence on its growth and development. The surrounding climatic conditions at both the macro- and meso-scales influence the plant-climate miro-scale interactions. The main study site is the McKenzie Vineyard that is owned by Torlesse Wines. The climatic conditions of the surrounding Waipara region was also studied using climate data from the following vineyards; Canterbury House, River Terrace and Waipara West. The overall aim of this research is to improve understanding of the influence of the climatic environment on grapevine development at the meso- to micro-scale. The main findings of the research were firstly, that the most important climatic factor influencing grapevine development and growth is temperature and secondly that there is variability in the temperature across the Waipara Basin. Future research should be conducted for the entire growth season to gain a better understanding of how temperature influences the development of grapevine over the growing season as a whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Waipara</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">viticulture</field><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">meso-scale</field><field name="subject">micro-scale</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading difficulties and psychosocial problems: Does social information processing moderate the link?</field><field name="creator">Nathan, Kim</field><field name="description">Children with reading difficulties (RD) are also likely to experience psychosocial problems. However, a significant proportion (30-50%) are indistinguishable, in psychosocial terms, from their typically-achieving (TA) peers. The aim of the current study was to identify aspects of social information processing which serve a protective function for children with RD, in terms of their at-risk status for concomitant psychosocial problems. Method: The sample comprised 42 children (21 with RD, and 21 TA), aged 9-11 years, with 11 boys and 10 girls in each group. A multifactor procedure was used to classify children as RD, based on the inclusionary criteria of teacher selection, and reading achievement below the 25th percentile, as well as several exclusionary criteria. The reading subtests of the WIAT-II, and the KBIT-2 (non-verbal IQ) measures were used to identify the presence of RD according to these criteria. The dependent variable, behavioural symptoms, was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, which was rated by both parents and teachers. Children (RD and TA) completed measures of theory of mind, understanding emotions in facial expression and tone of voice, attachment style, and affective experience. Results: As expected, RD were correlated with increased levels of psychosocial problems, and poorer theory of mind skills predicted increased psychosocial problems. Consistent with hypotheses, emotion understanding, positive affect, and secure attachment, moderated the link between RD and psychosocial problems. That is, better emotion understanding, more positive affect, and secure attachment status, functioned as protective factors for children in the RD group, but not those in the TA group. Conclusion: The findings are discussed in relation to extant findings, as well as within a risk and protective framework. Finally, strengths and limitations of the current study are described, and implications for psychosocial interventions suggested.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading difficulties</field><field name="subject">psychosocial problems</field><field name="subject">social information processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Families of children with developmental disabilities: family environment, social support and sibling well-being</field><field name="creator">Gousmett, Sharyn</field><field name="description">The funtioning of families of children with developmental disabilities has been of interest to researchers for some time.  To date, little research has focused on experiences of New Zealand families.  The aim of this research is to investigate relationships between various aspects of the family environment and family functioning, and to explore siblings' level of self-concept and satisfaction with the sibling relationship.  It is expected that families who receive more support from external levels of the environment will be able to function more effectively in their immediate environment (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Hornby, 1994).   Twenty-one parents and nineteen siblings of children with developmental disabilities volunteered to take part in this study.  Parent participants completed questionnaires about family demographics, the level of support received from external sources, their perceptions of the family environment, and level of stress related to child characteristics; pessimism and family problems.  Sibling participants completed questionnaires about their satisfaction with the relationship with their brother or sister, their self-concept, and their own perceptionso of the family environment.  The results indicate that there are a number of relationships between various aspects of the environment and family functioning.  Siblings who are more satisfied with their relationship have higher self-concept scores, however the self-concept scores were lower than expected.  Families who receive higher levels of support have more positive perceptions of the family enviornment, and families who have more support and more positive views of the environment have few concerns on the resources and stress scale.  The results indicated that families consider that they are receiving adequate support from professional services, however support from family and friends appears to be lacking.  This study has provided insight into the functioning of New Zealand families who have children with developmental disabilities, and has suggested a number of avenues for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children with developmental disabilities</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">sibling relationships</field><field name="subject">sibling well-being</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence and Charactrisation of Superoxide Dismutases in the Female Reproductive Structures of Petunia</field><field name="creator">YeYing Wang, Ying</field><field name="description">Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity in cell-free extracts prepared from healthy mature flowers of Petunia hybrida (variety 'Hurrah') was studied. The SOD activity in the crude extracts was stable for more than one month when stored at -20 oC. It was found that pH 7.8 is optimal for SOD activity.      Different flower tissues of petunia (stigma, style and ovary) at various stages of development were extracted and analysed for SOD activity. SOD activity was found to be significantly highest in the ovary tissue of dehiscent petunia flowers.     Three SOD isozymes were detected after crude extracts of the different female reproductive tissues of petunia flowers were analysed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. Based on a difference in the sensitivity of the SOD isoforms to H2O2 and KCN, it is suggested that Mn-SOD, Fe-SOD and Cu/Zn-SOD were present in the crude extracts of the female reproductive tissues of petunia flowers.      The response of the female reproductive parts of petunia flowers was also tested under water deficiency and high temperature (35 oC) stress. The SOD activity seemed to increase more in response to the high temperature than the water deficiency stress.      Intense blue staining was observed from developing younger buds, and much lower formazan deposition was detected at the later stage. This indicates the lower O2- produced during later stages mainly due to increasing SOD synthesis.     DEAE cellulose chromatography was successfully used to partially purify SOD from the ovaries of petunia flowers. The characteristics of the partially purified enzyme fraction were found to be very similar to those of the crude extracts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SOD</field><field name="subject">Petunia</field><field name="subject">isozymes</field><field name="subject">electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">formazan deposition</field><field name="subject">chromatography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spectroscopic and dynamical study of binary and other Cepheids</field><field name="creator">Petterson, Orlon King Lee</field><field name="description">High resolution observations have been made of a number of southern Cepheids to make an observational and theoretical study of Cepheid variables using radial velocities. The stars studied were part of a long term programme to observe southern variable stars, from which a valuable database of radial velocities gathered over a long period were available. Sixteen &#233;chelle spectrograph orders in the wavelength region 5400 - 8600&#8491; were used, which included a number of absorption lines covering a range of species and excitation potentials. The line bisector technique was used to measure stellar and telluric lines and to obtain radial velocities. To improve the precision of the radial velocities we used telluric lines to calibrate the observations to a common reference frame. The radial velocities have a precision of ~300ms&#8315;&#185; allowing the detection of velocity differences of ~1 kms&#8315;&#185; with confidence. The radial velocity data obtained at Mount John University Observatory (MJUO) was combined with data from various sources to determine the orbits of any Cepheids exhibiting orbital motion. The various orbital parameters were determined for a number of systems and where radial velocities for the companions exist, some estimate of the mass was made. The precision of the radial velocities obtained from MJUO also allowed us to search for line level effects for a number of species among the Cepheid spectra. A number of IAU standard stars were observed to calibrate the radial velocities obtained at MJUO to the IAU standard scale. The radial velocities from MJUO were found not to differ significantly from the IAU values. Binary Cepheids are particularly useful in the determination of Cepheid masses, which are still an active topic for astronomical research. The value of the MJUO data was that it provided a consistent set of data against which other sources of data could be compared. For 8 of the Cepheids new or improved orbital solutions were found. They are Y Car, YZ Car, AX Cir, BP Cir, S Mus, V636 Sco, V350 Sgr, W Sgr and T Mon. Of these 8 systems, 3 had radial velocities for their respective companions which allowed the determination of the mass of the Cepheids. Masses were determined for the 9 day Cepheid S Mus (6.0&#177;0.4M&#8857;), the double mode Cepheid Y Car (4.5&#177;1.8 M&#8857;) and the 5 day Cepheid V350 Sgr (6.0&#177;0.9 M&#8857;). New results presented here include the first orbital solution for the binary Cepheid AX Cir, a completely revised orbital solution for the binary Cepheid YZ Car which established its eccentricity, and orbital motion. The binary Cepheid BP Cir however was found to require a new pulsation period of 2.39819d to fit the observed pulsational velocities. Observations of the suspected binary Y Oph show it to be an unusual Cepheid with no evidence of binarity (~0.5 kms&#8315;&#185;) in our data. Finally, the 5 day Cepheid W Sgr was observed to have the lowest orbital amplitude measured. We discussed the line level effects found in our observations, where a number of spectral lines were observed to show departures from the Fei velocity curve. Line level effects were observed in H&#9082;, Ca&#8545;, Ba&#8545;, Fe&#8545;, Si&#8544; and Si&#8545;. Most of the Cepheids were observed to show the same progression of line level effects, with the best example being the bright Cepheid &#946; Dor. The Si&#8545; velocities indicate that these lines have the lowest velocity amplitude and form deeper in the atmosphere than the Fe&#8544;, where as the Ca&#8545; and H&#9082; lines were all observed to have much greater velocity amplitudes with the peak of these velocity curves occurring later, in pulsational phase. These observations are consistent with the lines forming at different depths as a density wave propagates through the atmosphere. X Sgr is peculiar due to its interesting spectra which at certain phases show line doubling and at most other phases the lines were asymmetric. These observations are interpreted to support the idea that X Sgr has strong shock waves present and that X Sgr has greater atmospheric transparency in the spectral region near 6000&#8491;. We also present the results of dynamical modelling of a pulsating Cepheid. Using a non-linear radiative hydrodynamic code developed by A. Fokin, we have modelled two Cepheids, AX Cir and YZ Car. These models have then been compared with the observations obtained here. After extensive modelling using the latest OP opacities, it has been determined that the Cepheid AX Cir can be modelled using parameters L = 2050 L&#8857;, M = 4.8 M&#8857; and Teff = 5900K. The model reproduced the observed stellar characteristics, such as the photometric amplitude and pulsational period. Comparison between the observations and the model for the selected spectral lines, Fe&#8544; 5576&#8491;, Si&#8545; 6347&#8491;, Ba&#8545; 5853&#8491; and Ca&#8545; 8542&#8491; show good agreement with similar amplitudes and velocity curves. With no strong shock waves being produced by the model, the observed line level effects can be explained by a density wave. The 18 day Cepheid YZ Car was chosen to explore the capabilities of the radiative hydrodynamic code for a long period Cepheid. The best model developed that reproduced the observed stellar characteristics had parameters L = 9350 L&#8857;, M = 7.7 M&#8857; and Teff = 5590K. The period was 18.314 days and the bolometric light curve agreed well with the observed visual light curve. Comparison of the theoretical and observed radial velocities showed good agreement.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astronomy</field><field name="subject">cepheids</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">binary</field><field name="subject">star</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of superoxide dismutase activity and superoxide production in kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Kolahi-Ahari, Ali</field><field name="description">The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined in three kiwifruit (Actinidia) species including A. deliciosa, A. chinensis, and A. arguta. Among the species tested, the highest SOD activity was found in crude extracts prepared from fruit tissues of A. deliciosa. The highest enzyme activity was localized in seed, followed by locules, core and outer pericarp (OP). SOD activity in crude extract of whole fruit remained stable for at least one month when stored at -20&#8451;. The effect of synthetic protease inhibitors (PI) on SOD activity was investigated. Supplementing crude kiwifruit extracts with PI improved SOD activity in freshly prepared extracts, and in extracts stored at 4&#8451;, but had no effect on those stored at -20&#8451;. Among the PI used, iodoacetamide (an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, for example, actinidin which is a principal protease found in kiwifruit) and PMSF (an inhibitor of serine proteases), had the most and least influence on SOD activity in crude kiwifruit extracts, respectively. There was a significant increase in SOD activity in kiwifruit (that were relatively firm) when the fruits were stored at low temperature (4&#8451;). An increase in SOD activity was also correlated with a decrease in fruit firmness. Staining fruit tissues with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) provided evidence for stress-induced superoxide generation in kiwifruit tissues. Taken together, the changes in SOD activity and the capacity for stress-inducible superoxide production in post-harvest kiwifruit suggest that SOD might play a fundamental role in the storage life/ripening of kiwifruit.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">superoxide</field><field name="subject">superoxide dismutase</field><field name="subject">kiwifruit</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do Severe Genetic Bottlenecks Lead to Greater Reproductive Failure?</field><field name="creator">Burrows, Ben Robert</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that populations which experience severe bottlenecks have a reduction in fitness. One of the most frequently reported fitness costs is increased hatching failure in bottlenecked populations of birds. The mechanism responsible for increased hatching failure is unknown. Research on other animals suggest that reduced population numbers cause unavoidable inbreeding that in turn leads to abnormalities in the gametes. In this thesis I examine some of the possible causes for increased hatching failure in severely bottlenecked populations of introduced birds in New Zealand. I look at three traits identified as a cause for infertility or hatching failure previously and determine whether there is a link with the size of a population s bottleneck. It is possible that reduced numbers of sperm reaching the site of fertilisation is a primary cause of hatching failure. I examined the perivitelline membrane of various species of introduced birds and counted the total number of sperm present to compare to how many would be expected in non-bottlenecked species. Although there was no relationship between the size of the bottleneck and the number of sperm present, all species had lower than expected sperm counts. In many species of mammals, a reduction in the quality of sperm is attributed to inbreeding depression bought about by genetic bottlenecks. I next compared the level of sperm abnormalities, variation in midpiece size sperm, and sperm motility with the size of the bottleneck each species passed through when introduced to New Zealand. There was no significant correlation between either the variation in midpiece size or sperm motility with bottleneck size. However, there was a trend for species that passed through more severe bottlenecks to have a slightly higher level of midpiece size and lower motility. Finally, I examined whether there was a link between abnormalities in the eggshell and the size of the respective bottleneck. There was no significant change in eggshell thickness or any change in the number of pores associated bottleneck size. However, there was a decreased number of round pores in severely bottlenecked species, although the consequences of this are unknown. My findings do not directly link a single cause for increased hatching failure in bottlenecked species of birds, but they do highlight the need for monitoring of reproductive traits in endangered species that have experienced a population bottleneck.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic Bottleneck</field><field name="subject">reproductive failure</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">sperm</field><field name="subject">eggshell</field><field name="subject">New Zealand conservation</field><field name="subject">inbreeding depression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masting and insect pollination in the dioecious alpine herb aciphylla</field><field name="creator">Young, Laura May</field><field name="description">Aciphylla species (wild spaniard/speargrass) are an iconic component of the Australasian high country flora, but their reproductive system is enigmatic. They are insect-pollinated dioecious mast seeders (synchronous highly variable seed production), which seems maladaptive. The resource supply to pollinators is highly variable, yet dioecious plants are dependent on pollinators, and dioecious masting requires male and female plants to flower synchronously. Floral display in Aciphylla is relatively large, with tall inflorescences bearing thousands of flowers, suggesting that plants would not have the resources to produce such large stalks every year. But why do they have such huge inflorescences in the first place? I tested whether pollinator attraction is providing an economy of scale which favours intermittent production of very large inflorescences, by manipulating floral display size during a high-flowering year and measuring insect visitation rates and seed set (female reproductive success). Using space-for-time substitution and selective removal of male inflorescences, I also tested whether female seed set was affected by distance to flowering male plants (i.e. changes in local pollen availability) to see if flowering asynchrony would reduce pollination success. Bags were used to exclude pollination by insects and test for wind pollination, and hand pollination was done to test for pollen limitation. Insect surveys suggest that Aciphylla has a generalist pollination system (to avoid satiating a specialist pollinator during 'mast' years'). Male inflorescences received significantly more visits than females, and some seeds were set inside bags (although only 20-30%), suggesting wind pollination may occur at low levels. Seed set rate was higher for taller inflorescences with greater flowering length in A. aurea but tall inflorescences with excess flowers led to a decrease in seed set rates in A. scott-thomsonii. Hand pollination significantly increased seed set rates although these effects were not as large as expected (e.g. 10% increases from natural to hand-pollinated inflorescences were typical). There was no evidence for resource limitation in any species. Female plants in dense flowering populations had higher seed set rates, and individual floral display size in females was particularly important when females were 'isolated' from males. Insect visitation rates were generally higher on inflorescences with a larger floral display, suggesting that display size is important for pollinator attraction. Overall, these results suggest that the pollinator-attraction benefits of such a large floral display (at both the plant and population level) are possibly providing an economy of scale, although the relative effects are small.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mast seeding</field><field name="subject">dioecy</field><field name="subject">insect pollination</field><field name="subject">display size</field><field name="subject">pollinator attraction</field><field name="subject">economies of scale</field><field name="subject">resource limitation</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">breeding system</field><field name="subject">Apiaceae</field><field name="subject">Aciphylla</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleosynthesis and s-process element formation in giant stars</field><field name="creator">Wylie, Elizabeth Claire</field><field name="description">A thorough understanding of nucleosynthesis and element formation in stars of all evolutionary phases is of vital importance in stellar astrophysics.  It provides information about internal structure, conditions and nuclear processes occurring in the stellar interior.      The heavy elements formed in a star throughout its life are returned to the interstellar medium through mass loss processes.  New populations of stars are then formed from this previously enriched material.  This continues the cycle of element recycling in the Universe and has great consequence for galactic chemical evolution.      As both modelling and observing techniques advance, more surveys are required to ensure there is agreement between the two.  It is hoped that when a thorough understanding of the internal processes in giant stars is reached, the evolutionary models will reproduce the observed elemental yields.      This work provides an internally self-consistent analysis of the element abundances produced via nucleosynthesis and s-process element formation occurring in giant stars in different stellar environments.      High resolution spectroscopic observations have been taken of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars in three different stellar environments.  Spectrum synthesis has been used to determine s-process element abundances for RGB stars in the Hyades open cluster, RGB and AGB stars in  the globular cluster, 47 Tucanae, and AGB stars in the galactic field.      It was found that the two Hyades giant studied showed solar, or near-solar, abundances of s-process elements.  Enhancements in the light s-process elements, Y and Zr, of +0.02 to +0.11 were observed, while enhancements in the heavy s-process elements, La, Pr and Nd, ranged from +0.06 to +0.16.  These results are consistent with previous findings of enhancements in Y of ~+0.12, and of ~+0.15 for the heavy s-process elements.      The results from 47 Tucanae suggest a genuine star-to-star scatter in the s-process element abundances in the giant stars of this globular cluster.  This is unexpected due to the fact that stars in a globular cluster are thought to have the same formation and chemical history.  However, spreads in s-process element abundances of as much as +-0.7 dex are observed between this study and three other studies of similar stars in the same cluster.       A range of field stars along the AGB phase, ranging from M to MS to S to SC, have been analysed for s-process enrichment.  The observed element abundances are compared with those predicted by recent modelling of the AGB phase of evolution.  Enhancements in s-process element abundances range from [s/Fe]~0.00 for M stars, to ~+0.50 for MS stars, through to ~+0.95 for S stars.  The comparison of these enhancements with those predicted by modelling provides an indication of the success of these models and will enable theoreticians to further refine their understanding of the internal nucleosynthetic processes present in giant stars.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Astrophysics</field><field name="subject">nucleosynthesis</field><field name="subject">giant stars</field><field name="subject">globular clusters</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing the Janzen-Connell model for species diversity in a West African montane forest.</field><field name="creator">Matthesius, Arne</field><field name="description">A major question in ecology is 'why are tropical forests so species diverse?' One  hypothesis to explain tropical species diversity is the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. This  model assumes high levels of host-specific seed and seedling predation and / or  pathogen attack when seedlings occur at high density near to the parent tree; seedlings  are more likey to survive and reach maturity the further they are away from parents /  conspecific adults. Theoretically this should lead to a random distribution of each  species in the forest, which in turn will lead to high species diversity. Here I test the  Janzen-Connell hypothesis for the first time in a submontane dry forest in Nigeria,  West Africa.  Specifically I tested whether or not a) leaf herbivory decreases and b) seedling  survival increases with distance from parent / conspecific adult trees. These two  components were tested separately on naturally occurring seedlings and on  experimentally planted seedlings. I also tested whether or not conspecific adult trees  showed clumped distributions by testing if conspecific nearest neighbours were  observed more often than would be expected by chance alone.  Naturally occurring seedlings of three species, Pouteria altissima, Newtonia  buchananii and Isolona pleurocarpa showed significantly greater survival at distances  away from parent / conspecific adult trees. Two out of a total of three species  (Entandrophragma angolense, Deinbollia pinnata and Sterculia pinnata) of  experimentally planted seedlings showed increased survival at distances away from  conspecific adult trees, but this trend was non-significant. Leaf herbivory decreased  with distance from parent / conspecific adult trees for four out of a total of six study  species, but all relationships of leaf herbivory with distance for these six species were  non-significant. Of two individual species, Anthonotha noldeae and Carapa procera,  and two species groups tested for clumping, all had a greater number of conspecific  nearest neighbours than would be expected to occur by chance alone, and this was  significant for the two species groups. The decreased survival of seedlings under  parent / conspecific adult trees is likely to maintain tree species diversity in West  African submontane forests as predicted by the Janzen-Connell model. The role of  host specific seedling herbivores in reducing recruitment under parent / conspecific  adult trees requires further investigation. Although conspecific adults showed some  degree of clumping no conclusion was reached as to whether this was evidence  for or against the Janzen-Connell model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Janzen-Connell</field><field name="subject">hypothesis</field><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magmatic response to the evolving New Zealand Margin of Gondwana during the Mid-Late Cretaceous</field><field name="creator">Tappenden, Vanessa Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The Mount Somers Volcanic Group (MSVG) and Mandamus Igneous Complex (MIC) are the magmatic manifestations of the transition from convergence to extension at the Gondwana margin, which culminated in the separation of New Zealand from Australia and Antarctica. The MIC has been correlated both geochemically and temporally with the Central Marlborough Igneous Province (CMIP). The MSVG and CMIP are located in the Eastern Province of New Zealand. The MSVG is restricted to the Rakaia terrane, whereas the CMIP is restricted to the Pahau terrane. The Rakaia and Pahau terranes are thick accretionary complexes, which were strongly deformed as a result of prolonged subduction at the Gondwana margin. The Pahau terrane is the younger of the two and continued to be deposited and deformed until the abrupt cessation of subduction, which in the Marlborough sedimentary record occurred in the Motuan (100 - 105 Ma). Following the cessation of subduction, after an interval of 2-7 Ma of relative quiescence and subsidence of the Pahau terrane, the MSVG and MIC were erupted/emplaced. The production of MSVG and MIC magmas occurred simultaneously and the activity was of short-lived duration. SHRIMP geochronology yielded crystallisation ages of 97.0 &#177; 1.5 Ma to 98.0 &#177; 1.2 Ma from zircons separated from MSVG rhyolites. The SHRIMP ages are within error of the previously published Rb-Sr age for the MIC. The SHRIMP geochronology also confirmed the presence of inherited zircons which yielded ages consistent with their derivation from the Rakaia terrane. Ar-Ar geochronology confirmed the coeval nature of the MSVG and MIC magmatism, but yielded consistently younger ages (94.5 &#177; 3 Ma for the MSVG and 94.2 &#177; 1.7 Ma for the MIC). The systematic differences in ages obtained by SHRIMP and Ar-Ar are believed to be method-dependent. The MSVG comprises a calc-alkaline volcanic assemblage, which ranges in composition from basaltic-andesite lavas (SiO&#8322; = 54.5%) to high-silica rhyolites and ignimbrites (SiO&#8322; &#8804; 78.1%). The MSVG had an original extent of at least 18 000 km&#178;. The magmas from the MSVG had high LILE/HFSE, high LILE/REE and moderately high LREE/HFSE which are characteristic of subduction derived magmas. Geochemical modelling suggests that the MSVG magmas were formed from partial melting of a subduction-modified mantle wedge, with high degrees of crustal assimilation. The assimilant had an isotopic composition similar to that of the Rakaia terrane, which is consistent with the geological setting of the MSVG. The MSVG has &#8312;&#8311;Sr/&#8312;&#8310;Sri from 0.7055 to 0.7100 and &#185;&#8308;&#179;Nd/&#185;&#8308;&#8308;Ndi from 0.51254 to 0.51230 (&#603;Nd +0.5 to -4.2), which reflects varying degrees of contamination by Rakaia terrane. Radiogenic isotope modelling suggests that the MSVG end-members were derived from the same parent magma, which evolved through AFC processes from basaltic-andesite to rhyolite. The modelling strongly suggests that assimilation played a lesser role in the petrogenesis of the Malvern Hills magmas than in the petrogenesis of the other units. AFC modelling requires the degree of assimilation to increase as the magmas evolved. Oxygen isotope data are consistent with high degrees of crustal assimilation, and may indicate that the assimilant had higher &#185;&#8312;O characteristics than the Rakaia terrane samples analysed. The MIC is an alkaline suite which ranges in composition from basalt and gabbro to syenite, trachyte and phono-tephrite. The MIC is interpreted to have formed from enriched asthenospheric mantle, with a composition similar to HIMU (&#178;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&#178;&#8304;&#8308;Pbi ranges from 19.2 to 20.3). The samples range in isotopic composition from &#8312;&#8311;Sr/&#8312;&#8310;Sri = 0.7030 to 0.7036, &#185;&#8308;&#179;Nd/&#185;&#8308;&#8308;Ndi = 0.51275 to 0.51268 (&#603;Nd +4.6 to +3.3). The range in isotopic composition is due to varying degrees of contamination by Pahau terrane, which reaches a maximum of 25% but in most samples is &lt; 10%. The MIC is contaminated to a much lesser extent than the MSVG which is interpreted to be related to the thinner nature of the Pahau crust in the mid-Cretaceous. The latest phases of activity in the MIC were subjected to lower degrees of contamination which is interpreted to reflect the passage of magmas through pre-existing pathways. The onset of MSVG and CMIP magmatism coincided with the initiation of major rift-related depositional basins, and the eruption of the MSVG is demonstrably associated with normal faulting. The tectonic trigger responsible for the sudden onset of magmatism and rifting in the Eastern Province terranes was the detachment of the previously subducting slab following the cessation of subduction due to the arrival of the Hikurangi Plateau at the margin and the subsequent stalling of the Pacific spreading centre. The capture of the Gondwana margin led to the propogation of extension into the margin by the divergent Pacific plate. The ensuing extension aided the detachment of the subducting slab beneath the Eastern Province terranes. The slab-detachment promoted decompression melting of the sub-lithospheric mantle wedge to produce the MSVG magmas and triggered the ascent of asthenospheric mantle through the slab window, which melted through decompression to produce the CMIP magmatism. The asthenospheric mantle tapped by the slab detachment episode was highly enriched relative to N-MORB and is akin to the similar age HIMU-OIB affinity melts documented from Antarctica and Australia. The short-lived duration of activity is typical of slab-detachment related magmatism which occurs as a passive response to plate reconfiguration. The similarity in geochemistry of the MIC with OIB-affinity igneous centres in Australia and Antarctica implies an enriched mantle domain of large geographical extent. The distribution of relatively small volumes of OIB magmatism is suggestive of a fossil plume component, which was tapped in response to lithospheric extension producing relatively short-lived HIMU magmatism. The same fossil plume component has previously been implicated in the formation of the Cenozoic West Antarctic Rift System and may be responsible for the late Cretaceous magmatism in the Chatham Islands and Tertiary volcanics of the South Island of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">magmatism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Gondwana</field><field name="subject">Mount Somers</field><field name="subject">Mandamus</field><field name="subject">SHRIMP</field><field name="subject">Ar-Ar</field><field name="subject">U-Pb</field><field name="subject">Slab-detachment</field><field name="subject">OIB</field><field name="subject">plume</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mid-Pleistocene Extinction of Deep-Sea Ostracoda?</field><field name="creator">Gaiger, Frances Jean</field><field name="description">A global extinction event has been documented in protozoan foraminifera in the late Pliocene to Pleistocene. The timing of the extinction event varied depending on location, however for Ocean Drilling Project Site 1125, disappearances occurred between 2.5 and 0.57 Ma, with the major decline approximately 1.1 Ma. In order to determine if this event affected benthic organisms other than protozoans, this study was undertaken to determine how podocopid ostracods (Crustacea) recovered Ocean Drilling Program Site 1125 responded.  The present study was hindered by the small number of valves recovered; the fact that a large proportion of taxa found were undescribed and new to science; and the current state of taxonomic scheme that is under significant revision. These factors meant that a comprehensive comparison could not be achieved. Despite this, counts of ostracod valves and assessments of diversity from this study reveal a significant increase in both parameters from approximately 900-600 ka. Three possible causes were investigated to account for this increase, sediment type and sample size; affects of taphonomy, mainly dissolution; or an actual biotic 'event'.   Statistical analyses showed that although sample size did have some effect, it was not the sole reason for the increase in ostracod numbers. Dissolution had an expected affect on the percentage of juveniles but no correlations were found with other sample characteristics. Sedimentation rate was investigated but this also proved unrelated. Therefore, it is suggested that the increase in total ostracod valves and diversity which occurs between 900 and 600 ka was in fact a natural, biotic 'event'. This preliminary evidence suggests that an oceanographic event that has negatively impacted on the foraminifers has had the reverse affect on the ostracod assemblage, in the sense that both population size and diversity increase during that time.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ostracod</field><field name="subject">Chatham Rise</field><field name="subject">Pleistocene</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Taphonomy</field><field name="subject">South West Pacific</field><field name="subject">Extinction</field><field name="subject">Diversification</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Dosimetric Characteristics and  Exploration of Potential Applications of Amorphous  Silicon Detector</field><field name="creator">Jhala, Ekta</field><field name="description">The ability of the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) to acquire a large two-dimensional array of digitized x-ray data in real time is extremely attractive for dosimetric measurements. To evaluate the potential use of an EPID for portal dose measurement in Wellington Blood and Cancer Centre, some dosimetric characteristics of the Varian's PortalVisionTM aS500 were investigated. PortalVisionTM incorporates an amorphous silicon detector (aSi). Some potential applications of EPID in linac QA were also explored.    The EPID's performance for linearity with MU and dose rate was verified and it was found to be proportional over the entire measured range. Short term repeatability was found to be excellent. An investigation of calibration method to improve dosimetric accuracy demonstrated two methods of avoiding detector saturation. Firstly, acquiring flood field with the use of additional buildup and secondly, increasing the source to detector distance for calibration. A study of EPIDs behaviour under conditions of varying dose  rate which commonly arise in EDW treatment techniques was carried out. The EPID exhibited a field size dependence in addition to a 8% discrepancy on the `hot edge' of EDW profiles. Further investigation into the field size dependence and the discrepancy at hot edge is required. EPIDs ability to acquire asymmetric field profile was also investigated. The profiles acquired using EPID deviated in shape and magnitude by upto 16% from the ion chamber profiles.    Some potential applications of EPID to perform QA of linac beam properties, its ability to perform optical and mechanical linac QA have been explored. The EPID's capability to give constant output, flatness, symmetry, wedge angle and wedge factors with high level of accuracy and reproducibility was demonstrated. EPID was also found to be objective, efficient and feasible for performing optical linac QA. The use of EPID  for linac QA could be simplified by improving the available software analysis tools thus making it more efficient.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EPID</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food insecurity and the food bank industry: a geographical analysis of food bank use in Christchurch</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Katrina Louise</field><field name="description">Food banks are potent symbols of the prevalence of poverty and food insecurity in affluent countries, yet they have received very little academic attention in New Zealand. Previous food bank research in this country has mainly been instigated by the voluntary welfare sector and has focused on client characteristics and patterns of use. This study expands on these concepts in the local context from a socio-spatial perspective, and examines food banks from both a service provision and service user perspective.    This study aims to: document the growth of the food bank industry and determine its role within the broader voluntary welfare sector; determine patterns and trends in usage; examine client characteristics, neighbourhoods and reasons for use; and discuss the implications of food bank use and how dependency on food banks may be reduced.    This study examines non-identifiable socio-demographic and address data obtained for food bank clients (n=1695) from a large Christchurch social service agency for 2005. Data from a second large Christchurch social service agency is used to illustrate certain spatial and temporal trends. Additional interviews and questionnaires are conducted with staff and volunteers in the local food bank industry, and with the clients themselves.  Results show that food bank use appears not to have decreased in recent years. Maori, sole parents/sole caregivers and beneficiaries are over-represented amongst food bank clients, while there is an apparent under-use of the food bank by other key groups. Poverty and food insecurity appears to be dispersed in Christchurch and is not confined to the most deprived neighbourhoods. A range of factors contributes to food insecurity and food bank use, with the main reasons relating to lack of income, household bills and unaffordable housing. Changes in macro social and economic policy, rather than increased client education, will contribute to a decrease in the need for food banks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food bank</field><field name="subject">food insecurity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conditioned place preference and spatial memory: contributions towards thalamus and memory</field><field name="creator">Adams, Melissa Jean</field><field name="description">Conventional theories of diencephalic amnesia have focused on a single thalamic region as a critical factor in the origins of anterograde amnesia.

In this study I investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on stream invertebrate communities on Banks Peninsula. Six catchments were investigated, three with continuous indigenous forest in the riparian zone and three with fragmented indigenous riparian forest. An extensive benthic survey was conducted at three sites in each river catchment, one downstream on the mainstem of the river and two sites in different headwater tributaries. Adult sampling, consisting of malaise and sticky trapping, was also conducted at a sub-set of sites. Taxonomic richness of both the benthic and adult communities was significantly higher in continuous forest than in fragmented forest, and the composition of benthic communities also differed between continuous and forest fragments.   Furthermore, benthic invertebrate densities were higher in fragments than continuous forest sites. The fragments in the headwaters were more likely to support forest specialist taxa (e.g. the stonefly Zelandobius wardi, and the caddisfly Costachorema peninsulae), than the downstream fragments. My results indicate that forest fragmentation has resulted in marked changes in benthic communities on Banks Peninsula, and that location of the fragment within the catchment also is important in influencing the diversity and composition of benthic communities.

However, the efficacy of these riparian buffers can be jeopardised by variations in width, length, and vegetation which can range from native and exotic scrub (including bracken, gorse, broom and blackberry) to remnant beech forest.  This thesis investigates the influence of riparian vegetation age and composition, on stream ecosystems within exotic pine plantations.  Initially, a survey of 50 streams within pine forests of various ages and riparian composition was conducted at sites from mid-Canterbury to Hanmer Springs over the summer of 2004-2005.  Additionally, terrestrial subsidies were compared between young pine, mature pine and indigenous forest streams to ascertain differences or similarities between vegetation types.  A range of physico-chemical and biological characteristics were recorded, while vegetative age and composition with catchment, riparian buffer and reach scales were determined using GIS.  Forestry activities were found to vary temporarily and tended to adversely impact upon streams where riparian buffers were narrow and lacked indigenous vegetation.  Stream instability and sedimentation were consistently higher in catchments lacking indigenous riparian vegetation, and more markedly so in recently harvested catchments compared with more mature forests.  Streams dominated by pine forests had finer substrates with higher water temperatures and levels of turbidity, while those dominated by indigenous forest had coarser substrates, higher flows and dissolved oxygen levels, and less in-stream debris.  Benthic community composition was similar among sites, although taxonomic richness, EPT diversity, and invertebrate abundances were enhanced by indigenous riparian vegetation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stream communities</field><field name="subject">Benthic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="subject">Riparian buffer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand and south-east Australian ilyarachninae (isopoda: asellota: munnopsidae) and their worldwide relationships</field><field name="creator">Merrin, Kelly Leeann</field><field name="description">The diversity of New Zealand and Australian asellote isopods remains largely unknown. Even less is known about how this fauna is related to the rest of the world. This study focuses on the munnopsid subfamily Ilyarachninae Hansen, 1916, to explore the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of the local fauna to others from this group worldwide.    To analyse the relationships within the Ilyarachninae, a suitable outgroup, in this case, the sister group, was needed to be determined. To do this, a cladistic analysis of the Munnopsidae was undertaken. In addition to determining a suitable outgroup, the family level analysis also served to test the monphyly of the nine subfamilies and to resolve the placement of the three genera, Munneurycope Stephensen, 1913, Munnicope Menzies and George, 1972 and Munnopsurus Richardson, 1912b which were not placed in any exsiting subfamily. The cladistic analysis of the Munnopsidae included 72 species representing all munnopsid genera, including where possible, the type species and was based on 122 morphological characters. A well resolved strict consensus tree was found. The results show Munnopsurus to be the sister group of the Ilyarachninae and the Munnopsinae to be the most ancestral group of the Munnopsidae. Of all the subfamilies, the Betamorphinae is not a monophyletic. The results show that although some subfamily names are upheld, others show no congruence to the topology of the results, and therefore the use of subfamily names are abandoned. Four families are instead recognized, the Munnopsidae (restricted to the former Munnopsinae), Acanthocopidae Wolff, 1962, the Syneurycopidae Wolff, 1962 and the Lipomeridae Tattersall, 1905a, with the latter including the former Ilyarachninae ('Ilyarachna-group').    Within the Ilyarachna-group, two new genera and 28 species were described, including 25 species new to science. Two genera, Notopais and Epikopais n. gen. are found exclusively in the southern hemisphere. Of the more cosmopolitan genera, some New Zealand and south-east Australian species display close affinities to each other and with Antarctic species. These relationships were tested using cladistic phylogenetic methods, and in addition to this, the analysis also served to test the monophyly of the genera. The analysis used 59 species, representing all genera and 61 morphological characters. The strict consensus tree was well resolved, however Aspidarachna Sars, 1897b, Ilyarachna Sars, 1870 and Echinozone Sars, 1897b were not monophyletic. The results also showed that the Ilyarachna-group fauna of New Zealand and south-east Australia are closely related to each other and to species from Antarctica.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isopoda</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Munnopsidae</field><field name="subject">Ilyarachninae</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the snow and avalanche hazard on the Milford Road, Fiordland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hendrikx, Jordy</field><field name="description">Avalanches pose a significant natural hazard in many parts of the world. Worldwide the  hazard is being managed in a number of new and traditional methods. In New Zealand,  the Milford Road, Fiordland, has a significant avalanche problem which has been  managed by the Transit New Zealand Milford Road Avalanche Programme since 1984.  This avalanche programme has generated a database of all avalanche occurrences and  associated meteorological parameters for the time period 1985 to 2002. Elsewhere around  the world, similar and more extensive data sets have been used to examine a wide variety  of aspects in relation to the snow cover, avalanching and avalanche hazard. The  availability of the Milford Road database has provided the opportunity use new and  traditional approaches to examine many aspects of avalanching including; the trends in  and relationships with the snow and avalanche regime, evaluation of the avalanche  hazard, statistical forecasting of avalanches and the visualisation of avalanche occurrence  information in a GIS.  Statistical and graphical examination of the inter-annual variation in the snow and  avalanche regime revealed relationships between the snow depth, avalanche occurrences  and atmospheric circulation similar to those found elsewhere around the world, but not  previously examined in New Zealand. Furthermore, the analysis resulted in strong  correlations despite using a database significantly shorter than those used elsewhere.  Atmospheric circulation types that bring strong winds and precipitation were found to be  highly significantly correlated with avalanche occurrences and snow depth. Avalanche  occurrences were more highly correlated with atmospheric circulation than snow depth  was, reflecting the strong maritime avalanche climate.  Risk evaluation was undertaken using two approaches, the avalanche hazard index (AHI)  and the probability of death to individuals (PDI) method. The present avalanche risk was  compared to a theoretically uncontrolled avalanche regime, using 2002 traffic volumes  for AHI and PDI. The AHI analysis highlighted the reduction in the AHI resulting from  the control programme, and the significantly lower AHI when compared to Rogers Pass,  B.C., Canada. The PDI analysis using equations modified to allow for a range of  consequences indicated that the Milford Road is similar in risk to roads in Switzerland,  but is far more accessible, with fewer closed days. A new equation for PDI, which  accounted for waiting traffic was derived, and suggested that the calculated risk was high  and unacceptable compared to standards applied to other hazards.  Statistical forecasting using classification tree analysis has been successfully applied to  avalanche forecasting in other climatic settings. This study has applied an extension to  this technique through 10-fold cross validation to permit classification of an avalanche  day in this direct action maritime climate. Using varying misclassification costs two  classification trees were generated. The tree that used only wind speed and wind speed  and precipitation combined in a temperature sensitive wind drift parameter obtained an  overall accuracy of 78%, with correct prediction for an avalanche day at 86%. These  predictor variables are considered to be the fundamental controls on avalanche  forecasting in this climate, and coincide with important variables inferred from the  atmospheric circulation analysis.  Following the investigation of various methods for the creation of a high resolution  digital elevation model (DEM), a GIS was used for the visualisation and examination of  avalanche occurrences. Similar to other studies, qualitative and quantitative analysis of  the spatial distribution in terms of aspect of avalanche occurrences was undertaken using  the GIS. Colour coding of occurrences highlighted the influence of two storm directions,  while an excess ratio showed the clear influence of aspect on avalanche occurrences in  relation to two dominant storm directions, avalanche size and avalanche paths.  Furthermore, the GIS has many applications for operational forecasting, teaching and the  maintenance of institutional memory for the avalanche programme.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">avalanche</field><field name="subject">hazard</field><field name="subject">Transit New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Milford</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequency and severity of offending by young people in New Zealand: Descriptive analysis and development of a predictive model</field><field name="creator">Galletly, Sharyn</field><field name="description">Youth offending is an increasingly major problem in many countries and cultures.  Several theories imply that a subset of young people display delinquent behaviour at a young age and go on to have an extensive and serious criminal career.  Recently, there has been interest in the literature in identifying these young people early on and carrying out interventions in order to deter them from a criminal career.  Many studies have examined the development and usefulness of actuarial measures of risk of future violence or recidivism in adult offenders.  However, the same attention has not been paid to the youth offender population.    The present study gathered data from the population (N = 4307) of all young persons in New Zealand whose antisocial behaviour resulted in a Youth Justice intake from the Department of Child, Youth, and Family (CYF) in 2002.  Information was obtained about this population from the CYF database, CYRAS, and from the Police National Intelligence Application database for a stratified random sample (N = 500).  Three models were developed using Hierarchical Cox regression to predict recidivism, and they each used a different definition of recidivism.  The performance of the models was assessed using ROC analysis and they were found to predict recidivism with a moderately good level of accuracy.  A validation sample (N = 500), different from the sample on which the models were developed, was used to further assess the performance of the models by showing that they were able to generalize to a new data set and continue to perform at an adequate level.  An actuarial model, like the one developed in the present study, could be used to help make decisions about which young people within the Youth Justice System require intervention in order to reduce the likelihood of subsequent reoffending.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth offending in NZ</field><field name="subject">predictive model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glutamate receptors in the ventral tegmental area: a potential mechanism involved in long term potentiation</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Scott Thomas Charles</field><field name="description">In the present study, footshock, which produces a powerful aversive emotional response was used in a Pavlovian conditioning experiment as an unconditioned stimulis (UCS), and was paired with the presentation of a light used as a conditioned stimulis (CS). There is an accumulation of evidence that supports the assertion that dopaminergic (DA) neurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are active in processes that contribute to the amygdala-based circuitry involved in regulating emotionally salient responses. To build upon findings implicating VTA DA, excitatory glutamate (Glu), NMDA and AMPA receptors, were examined with respect to their role in Pavlovian conditioned fear responding. Fear potentiated startle (FPS) was used to assess the effects of intra-VTA infused AP5, and intra-VTA infused CNQX on conditioned fear responding in laboratory rats. The administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (at 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0ug doses), blocked the ability of a conditioned stimulus (CS) previously paired with footshock to become conditioned to the UCS.  Similarly, administration of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (at 1.0, 2.5, 5.0ug doses), inhibited the ability of the CS to become conditioned to the UCS. The results of this study indicate the VTA is an important site for synaptic modifications associated with fear learning, and that activation of excitatory Glutamatergic receptors in the VTA play a necessary part of the processing underlying fear conditioning. Measures of shock reactivity demonstrated that the infusion of AP5 and CNQX into the VTA did not inhibit baseline startle amplitudes. The administration of AP5 and CNQX did not suppress    the perception of footshock as an aversive stimulus. This study provides further definition to established knowledge surrounding the neural processes whereby neutral environmental cues gain negative emotional salience as occurs in fear conditioning. It was hypothesised that the action of excitatory glutamatergic transmission within the VTA acts on NMDA and AMPA receptors is to assist in the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioned fear, possibly through the same synaptic mechanisms that govern LTP.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fear conditioning</field><field name="subject">AP5 and CNQX</field><field name="subject">footshock</field><field name="subject">unconditioned stimuliu</field><field name="subject">conditioned stimulus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive processing characteristics in obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Emily</field><field name="description">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is classified as an anxiety disorder characterized by distressing persistent unwanted ideas or impulses (obsessions) and urges and/or compulsion to do something to relieve the associated anxiety caused by the obsession. The thematic content of the obsessions are highly variable, ranging from symmetry, contamination to aggressive concerns. Compulsions tend to be linked to the obsessions, but can also be idiosyncratic to the intrusive thought. According to the cognitive model, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is maintained by various belief factors such as an inflated sense of responsibility, overestimation of threat and the over-control of thoughts. Despite much support for this hypothesis, there is a lack of specificity. This series of studies sought to determine the relationship between a number of cognitive beliefs and appraisal processes and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. This thesis presents the results of three studies. The first study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that certain beliefs are more prevalent in OCD, compared with other anxiety disorders. The second study expands on earlier findings by examining whether the six metacognitive beliefs proposed by the Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group, (OCCWG; 1997, 2001, &amp; 2003) correlate with specific symptom-based OCD subtypes. The final study addresses some of the methodological weaknesses inherent in retrospective self-report measures by replicating the study using experimental techniques. Most importantly, this research was conducted from within the theoretical framework of Rachman (1993) and Salkovskis (1989) models which emphasise the misinterpretation of significance of the intrusive thoughts. The first study explored the relationship between thought-action fusion (TAF) and inflated responsibility beliefs across individuals diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), an anxiety disorder other than OCD (anxious controls; AC), and a non-anxious control group (NAC). It was hypothesized that the OCD group would evidence significantly higher inflated responsibility and TAF scores, compared to the AC and NAC groups. In this study, non-clinical and clinical participants were recruited for research. The non-clinical group was comprised of undergraduate students (n = 22: mean age = 26.8; SD = 9.2). The clinical groups included 20 participants with OCD as their primary diagnosis (mean age = 32.1; SD = 11.9) and 21 individuals diagnosed with another anxiety disorder (mean age = 32.2; SD = 10.9). To measure inflated responsibility beliefs and thought action fusion, self-report questionnaires were administered to the participants. The results of this study demonstrated that inflated responsibility beliefs, while present in other anxiety disorders, were significantly higher in participants with OCD, even after controlling for depressed mood and TAF levels. No group differences emerged between the OCD and anxious groups on measures of TAF. Thus, it can be tentatively concluded that inflated responsibility beliefs may have a more robust relationship with OCD than TAF beliefs, which appear to act as a general vulnerability factor occurring along a continuum of anxiety disorders. The second study examined the associations between the six OCD-related beliefs: control of thoughts, importance of thoughts, responsibility, intolerance of uncertainty, overestimation of threat and perfectionism and five empirically derived OCD subgroups. Clinical participants with a primary diagnosis with OCD (n = 67: mean age = 38.0; SD = 11.7) were recruited over a period of two years from the Anxiety Disorders Unit. Participant responses were cluster analysed to form five stable groups: aggressive obsessions-checking compulsions (n = 22: mean age = 26.8; SD = 9.2); contamination obsessions-cleaning compulsions (n = 22: mean age = 26.8; SD = 9.2); symmetry concerns-ordering/arranging compulsions (n = 22: mean age = 26.8; SD = 9.2); hoarding obsessions-hoarding compulsions (n = 22: mean age = 26.8; SD = 9.2); and miscellaneous obsessions -miscellaneous compulsions (n = 22: mean age = 26.8; SD = 9.2). The second found that intolerance of uncertainty was significantly related to the contamination subgroup. While responsibility and threat estimation beliefs were higher in the aggressive-checking subgroup, these differences did not reach statistical significance. No other significant results were found, however, there was a non-significant trend for perfectionism beliefs to be higher in symmetry-ordering and hoarding subgroup. Following the results of this study, questions remained about whether the lack of significant findings reflected the generality of these beliefs or were due to methodological differences. This led to the development of the final study presented in this thesis. The purpose of the final study was to investigate whether the second study was limited by the method of assessment (e.g. self-report questionnaires). This study was unique, as it was the first of its kind to experimentally manipulate all six beliefs in empirically derived OCD subtypes. Twenty participants (mean age = 45.0; SD = 11.0) were chosen from the second study to form the following priori groups: contamination (n = 4: mean age = 44.5; SD = 9.5); aggressive (n = 6: mean age = 46.5; SD = 7.2); hoarding (n = 4: mean age = 47.2; SD = 6.9); and symmetry (n = 6: mean age = 41.8; SD = 17.4). Six behavioural experiments designed to reflect one of the six OCCWG beliefs were specifically developed and administered to the groups. Baseline scores were obtained using self-report questionnaires. The study found strong support for the use of experimental paradigms over self-report measures, as several significant interactions between cognitive beliefs and OCD symptom-based subtypes were found. Specifically, the hoarding subgroup evidenced significantly higher overall thought action fusion scores compared to those in the contamination group. The symmetry subgroup exhibited significantly higher anxiety than the aggressive group during the perfectionism task and demonstrated significantly higher scores on several items measuring perfectionism compared to the contamination group. Finally, over-estimation of threat beliefs was significantly higher in the contamination thoughts. No statistically significant group differences were found for controllability of thoughts, responsibility and intolerance of uncertainty. In conclusion, these studies collectively showed that in some cases of OCD certain beliefs appear highly applicable, whereas in others they are not. This finding may explain why some OCD patients have poor treatment outcomes as the beliefs and appraisals were highly variable across groups. These findings are of both theoretical and clinical significance because they add to the growing understanding that OCD may consist of distinct clusters of symptoms with different underlying motivations and beliefs. This finding is of clinical significance because treatment guidelines for OCD can become more specific, factoring into the therapy situation these underlying beliefs and appraisal processes. Lastly, the findings regarding inflated responsibility deserve special mention, given the significance of this construct in contemporary cognitive models. The results of the present studies were mixed with regard to responsibility as only the first study found a significant result. It appears that, like the other belief domains proposed by the OCCWG, responsibility may not be specific to all types of OCD and current cognitive models may benefit was shifting the emphasis to other belief domains.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obsessive-compulsive disorder</field><field name="subject">anxiety disorder</field><field name="subject">obsessions</field><field name="subject">anxiety caused by obsession</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population bottlenecks and the risk of parasitic and microbiological infections in the endangered saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus) and South Island robin (Petroica a. australis)</field><field name="creator">Hale, Katrina Anne</field><field name="description">Severe population bottlenecks and the small size of many remnant habitats may render many bird populations prone to extinction from disease outbreaks.  Bottlenecks may increase inbreeding which in turn may result in a low diversity of resistance and an immune system that is impaired or defective.  Thus, bottlenecked populations may be less immunocompetent and more vulnerable to microbiological and parasitic perturbations. Few studies have assessed the effect of bottlenecks on the immunocompetence of birds.   In this study, I used twelve saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus) and two New Zealand robin (Petroica a. australis) populations, to determine if the severe bottlenecks reduce the immunocompetence of birds. When I experimentally challenged the immune system of two robin populations I found that despite the two populations having similar parasite loads, robins from the severely bottlenecked Motuara Island population exhibited a significantly lower T-cell mediated immune response than the source population (Nukuwaiata Island) suggesting that birds passing through severe population bottlenecks have a compromised immunocompetence.  In the saddleback, severe bottlenecks, as well as high population densities and small island size, lead to individuals exhibiting higher stress levels and feather mite loads and lower immune function, as was evident by lower lymphocyte counts.  I did not find levels of fluctuating asymmetry of saddlebacks to be directly influenced by bottleneck size. However, I did find that individuals with higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry had higher loads of hippoboscid flies and lower loads of coccidia suggesting a possible trade-off between growth and immune function. In contrast to previous studies looking at behavioural secondary sexual traits, I found no effect of founder number on the size of wattles in saddleback.  I did however demonstrate that wattle size reflected the level of immune function in females as well as males, suggesting that females play a far greater role in offspring fitness than has been appreciated in traditional theories of sexual selection.    Overall, my results indicate that severe bottlenecks can lead to reductions in immunocompetence in the resulting populations, especially in those populations that pass through the most severe bottlenecks. Based on the evidence from my thesis, I recommend conservation managers should aim to use at least 90 individuals to found new populations in order to reduce the deleterious effects of bottlenecks on immune function.  If the costs of population bottlenecks and inbreeding are to be avoided, conservationists must adequately address the role of genetic factors in susceptibility to disease, and work towards minimising the risk of severe population bottlenecks in the management of endangered birds</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunocompetence</field><field name="subject">population bottlenecks</field><field name="subject">Philesturnus carunculatus</field><field name="subject">Petroica a. australis</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Onsager Heat of Transport  at the Liquid-Vapour Interface  of Glycerol-Water Solutions</field><field name="creator">James, Ronald Arthur</field><field name="description">The Onsager heat of transport, Q*, has been measured for water vapour above glycerol-water solutions (75 % to 94.5 % glycerol) over a temperature range of -46 to -32 &#8451;.

The specific aspects of residential burglary that are explored are the geography of burglary and clear-up rates, the characteristics of burglars, the distance they travel and the characteristics of the burgled properties. It was important to research these aspects of residential burglaries in Christchurch as there has previously been minimal research conducted into burglaries in Christchurch. The research that has been conducted is almost ten years old and did not comprehensively cover all aspects of burglaries. This thesis provides up to date analysis of the current burglary problem in Christchurch.    The residential burglary data was provided by the Christchurch Branch of the New Zealand Police Department. This data included the addresses of both burglary victims and offenders and demographic characteristics of offenders. Information regarding the burglary event such as the items stolen and the time and date that the burglary occurred, was also supplied. This data allowed for analysis into many aspects of burglaries. In order to substantiate the conclusions formed there is comparison with the results of international and national studies into burglaries.     The key findings of this research were that Christchurch residential burglary rates decreased and were positively related to deprivation. The greatest percent of burglaries occurred during traditional work times, during the traditional workweek. Conversely, the clear-up rates increased and were inversely related to deprivation. The majority of offenders were unemployed European males, aged between 15 and 19 years of age. Generally, offenders travelled short distances to burgle, and the distance was found to be negatively correlated with the level of deprivation of the area in which the victim lived. There were also some interesting findings regarding the characteristics of the burgled and non-burgled properties and how they differed depending on whether the property was in a deprived or non-deprived area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Burglary</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Black Hole Horizons and Black Hole Thermodynamics</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, Alex</field><field name="description">This work investigates how black holes can be described in terms  of different definitions of horizons.

The demographies of key species over varying spatial and temporal scales are fundamental to understanding the population structure and overall dynamics of habitats and assemblages. In this thesis, settlement, dispersal and early life stage survival and growth were examined in several habitat-forming intertidal fucoid algae in New Zealand and Oregon, U.S.A.  Natural settlement patterns of Hormosira banksii, Cystophora torulosa and Cystophora scalaris were quantified for over three years at a semi-protected shore in southern New Zealand. Settlement was monitored in four tidal zones, within bare rock and algal habitats. Settlement was synchronous between tidal zones but the density of settlement varied spatially and temporally. There were significant differences between tidal zones, habitats and times of the year. For H. banksii, small pulses of settlement occurred year-round with greatest densities during spring and early summer. Greatest settlement occurred at low tidal zones and under adult canopies. Both Cystophora species also reproduced year-round, but had much lower settlement densities than H. banksii. Most settlement occurred during spring and summer, while only small pulses occurred in autumn and winter months. Most settlement was in the lowest tidal zone (0.4 m above chart datum), with only a few zygotes settling at higher shore zones. Canopy cover had no significant effect on settlement densities.  Dispersal was examined in Durvillaea spp., H. banksii, C. torulosa and Fucus gardneri. For all species, settlement densities declined with distance from the source populations, but densities were variable between species. Durvillaea spp. dispersal was more extensive than expected, with significant settlement occurring 32 m from the source population, the maximum sample range of the study. However, settlement densities were much higher within 8 m from the source. The extensive dispersal of Durvillaea spp. is a result of the combination of small, slowly sinking eggs and the presence of buoyant mucilage. The other species studied showed far more restrictive dispersal, and much lower settlement densities. Settlement occurred 2 m from the source, but most settlement occurred under or near the canopy. The eggs of these species are much larger and sink faster than the eggs of Durvillaea spp.  The consequences of settling at different shore heights and seasons were examined in H. banksii and D. antarctica in New Zealand, and F. gardneri and Pelvetiopsis limitata in Oregon. Transplant experiments tested the effects of grazing and heat/desiccation stress on survival and growth of germlings at different shore heights, during different seasons. High germling mortality was a feature of all species, but rate of mortality depended on conditions and species. There is a trade-off for settling at different times of the year; overall, growth was faster in warmer seasons, but survival was better in cooler seasons. During cooler seasons, germlings are exposed to less heat/desiccation stress, but their slow growth exposes them to grazing and competitive interactions for longer periods. For New Zealand species, shore height had large effects, with better survival and growth in the low shore. Grazers were very effective in the low shore, and heat/desiccation stress had strong effects in the mid and high shores. For Oregon species, effects of grazing and heat/desiccation stress were generally weaker than for New Zealand species. Shore height had weak effects, but ultimately low shore germlings had poor survival, primarily because of overgrowth by ephemeral algae. This is in contrast to the generalisation that survival and growth in the low shore should be better due to a more benign environment.  In this study, species had specific demographies that related to their life history characteristics and responses to the local environment. Differences in settlement, dispersal abilities, survival and growth over small spatial and temporal scales clearly underpinned large scale differences in recruitment and adult distribution and abundances.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intertidal fucoid algae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Methadone on Clinical and Neurobehavioural Outcomes of Infants Measured at Term</field><field name="creator">Quick, Zoe Louise</field><field name="description">This study examined the effects of prenatal exposure to methadone on clinical and neurobehavioural outcomes of infants between 40 and 42 weeks gestation. The aims of this study were: (a) to describe clinical and neurobehavioural outcomes of infants exposed to methadone during pregnancy, (b) to examine the effects of maternal methadone dose during pregnancy on infant clinical and neurobehavioural measures, and (c) to examine the extent to which associations between exposure to methadone during pregnancy and infant outcomes persisted after statistical control for a range of confounding variables. Two groups of study infants were recruited. These consisted of 51 consecutively recruited infants born to mothers maintained on methadone during their pregnancy and 42 randomly identified non-methadone exposed comparison infants. Prior to her child's birth, each pregnant woman completed a comprehensive maternal interview. At birth and during the infant's hospital stay a broad perinatal data-base was collected. At 42 weeks gestation infants underwent a neurobehavioural assessment including the NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale (NNNS; Lester &amp; Tronick, 2004) and infant cry analysis. Study results showed significant differences across several clinical and neurobehavioural measures. Infants exposed to methadone in utero were found to be significantly lighter, have smaller head circumferences, and spend longer in hospital. Neurobehaviourally, they were significantly less well regulated, less attentive, more easily aroused, more excitable, and more hypertonic. In addition, they exhibited less motor maturity, displayed more stress abstinence symptomatology, and required more support from the assessor in order to remain in an appropriate state. Concurrent analysis of infant cry characteristics revealed no significant differences between the fundamental frequencies or the melody contours of the two groups. However, infants prenatally exposed to methadone did display higher levels of frequency perturbation in their cries, as evidenced by analysis of their jitter factor and percentage of directional jitter. Analysis of the effects of maternal dose during pregnancy suggested that maternal dose levels above 60mg/day were general indicative of poorer infant outcomes than those below 60mg/day, with significant linear trends occurring across a number of measures. The extent to which associations between methadone exposure during pregnancy and infant outcomes reflected either a) the direct effects of methadone exposure and/or b) the effects of confounding factors correlated with maternal methadone use was examined using regression analysis. The results of this analysis for infant clinical outcomes showed confounding variables attenuated the effects of methadone exposure on infant birth length and, to some degree, infant head circumference. In contrast, associations between methadone exposure during pregnancy and most neurobehavioural outcomes remained significant, suggesting that maternal methadone use during pregnancy is an important, independent predictor of infant neurobehavioural functioning. These findings support the view that prenatal exposure to methadone has at least short term impacts on the infant's central nervous system (CNS) development. Important implications of possible vulnerabilities faced by these infants and their families are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">methadone</field><field name="subject">neurobehavioural</field><field name="subject">NNNS</field><field name="subject">prenatal</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of attachment style on coping strategies, identity development and the perception of social support</field><field name="creator">Baker, Josephine Kate</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the relationship between adult attachment style, coping strategies, identity development and perception of social support. 107 participants answered four self-report questionnaires examining their attachment style, coping strategies, identity development status and perception of social support. Correlation analyses were used. Results showed secure attachment to significantly positively correlate with identity moratorium and to negatively correlate with identity foreclosure. Avoidant attachment significantly positively correlated with denial and mental disengagement and negatively correlated with seeking social support. Individuals with high avoidant attachment scores were more likely to have high scores for identity diffusion, more likely to perceive fewer available social supports and were less likely to be satisfied with this support. Anxious ambivalence positively correlated with denial and mental, behavioural and alcohol/drug disengagement, and negatively correlated with active and planning which are pro-active coping strategies. Anxious ambivalence positively correlated with identity diffusion and negatively with identity foreclosure. Individuals with high anxious ambivalence scores were more likely to be dissatisfied with social support. Overall, secure attachment was found to correlate with acknowledging the need for an identity search. Insecure attachment was found to relate to less effective coping methods, to correlate with not acknowledging the need for an identity search and dissatisfaction with social support.

The IRRAS instrument used in this research is a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer coupled by an IR fibre-optic cable to a grazing-angle sampling head with a fixed incidence angle of 80&#176;. The introduced flexibility permits collection of in situ spectra from contaminated surfaces. Calibration models are developed using the multivariate, linear partial least squares (PLS) statistical method.   The research focuses on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a model cleaning agent, on metal (aluminium and stainless steel) and dielectric (glass, EPDM and silicone) surfaces. The effects of surface finish are investigated for SDS on stainless steel. Calibrations for SDS and paracetamol in the presence of each other on glass surfaces are examined, as well as a common industrial cleaner (P3 cosa&#174; PUR80) on polished stainless steel.  For the calibration sets in this thesis, RMSECV values were &lt; 0.41 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;, corresponding to conservative surface residues detection limits of better than ~0.86 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;. However, RMSECV values depend on the calibration loading range, and the detection limits were typically ~0.2 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178; for loading ranges 0-2.5 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;. These are below visual detection limits, generally taken to be 1-4 &#181;g cm&#8315;&#178;, depending on the analyte and substrate. This shows that IRRAS is a viable method for the real-time detection and quantification of surface contamination by surfactants and active pharmaceutical ingredients on metals and dielectrics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">cleaning validation</field><field name="subject">grazing-angle</field><field name="subject">Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">surface contamination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loneliness in the Workplace</field><field name="creator">Wright, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Loneliness in the workplace has received relatively little attention in the literature. The research surrounding loneliness tends to focus almost exclusively on personal characteristics as the primary determinant of the experience, and largely ignores the workplace as a potential trigger of loneliness. As such, personality tends to be overestimated as the reason for loneliness, whilst only modest emphasis is given to environmental factors, such as organisational environments. Therefore, the overall aim of this thesis was to explore the notion of loneliness in the workplace, with a particular emphasis on examining the antecedents and outcomes of its development in work contexts. The first stage of the research included the development and empirical examination of a scale measuring work-related loneliness. A 16-item scale was constructed and tested for its reliability and factor structure on a sample of 514 employees from various organisations. Exploratory factor analysis indicated two factors best represent the data, namely Social Companionship and Emotional Deprivation at Work. For the main study, a theoretical model was constructed whereby various antecedents (personal characteristics, social support, job characteristics, and emotional climate) were hypothesised to influence the development of work-related loneliness, which in turn was thought to affect employee attitudes and wellbeing. Employees from various organisations were invited to participate in the online research via email, which generated 362 submissions from diverse occupational groups. Structural equation modelling techniques were used to assess the hypothesised model, which was evaluated against a number of fit criteria. The initial results provided limited support for the Loneliness at Work Model. Consequently, a number of adjustments were necessary to obtain sufficient fit. The modified model suggests that organisational climate (comprising climate of fear, community spirit at work, and organisational fit) serves to simultaneously predict the emotional deprivation factor of loneliness (made up of seven items) and employee attitude and wellbeing. The results indicate that environmental factors such as fear, lack of community spirit, and value congruence play a role in the experience of work-related loneliness and have an overall negative effect on employee withdrawal behaviours and job satisfaction. The findings from this study offer insight into possible areas for organisational intervention and future research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Loneliness</field><field name="subject">lonely</field><field name="subject">workplace</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">organisational climate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pre- and Post Recruitment Processes Determining Dominance by Mussels on Intertidal Reefs in Southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Seaward, Kimberley Jayne</field><field name="description">The current explanation for the absence, or low abundance, of filter-feeding invertebrates from some rocky shores is that because of local variation in nearshore oceanographic conditions, larvae do not arrive in sufficient numbers to establish populations. One putative consequence of this is that macroalgae are able to establish dominance in areas where filter-feeders (especially mussels) do not recruit well. While macroalgae have been transplanted to mussel-dominated shores with varying success, the survival, growth and reproduction of transplanted mussels has not been tested in areas dominated by macroalgae.   To determine specifically what tips the balance between shores dominated by filter-feeding invertebrates and those dominated by macroalgae, I monitored the recruitment of intertidal mussels at four sites on the Kaikoura coast: two with mussels present and two algal-dominated. No significant differences in mussel recruitment rates were found between habitats and recruitment intensity at all sites was found to be very low. Recruitment limitation is not the reason for the absence of mussels from algal dominated shores but some form of limitation does occur to reduce the number of arriving mussels.   Predation effects were examined by transplanting juvenile mussels into caged, uncaged and control treatments. No significant differences in predation rates between habitats were found and transplanted mussels in open cages at all sites were removed within 3 days. Mobile fish predators appeared to be the most likely cause of this intense predation.   Growth of transplanted mussels into algal and mussel habitats was found to be significantly different. Mussels grew faster in mussel dominated habitats and after 6 months in algal dominated habitats, all mussels had died.   The outcome of these experiments indicates that there is a close relationship between recruitment, survival and growth which tips the balance and allows the existence of mussel beds along the Kaikoura coastline.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mussels</field><field name="subject">Kaikoura</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">recruitment</field><field name="subject">predation</field><field name="subject">Xenostrobus pulex</field><field name="subject">Mytilus galloprovincialis</field><field name="subject">Perna canaliculus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between inhibitory control and System 1 and System 2 processes in deductive and spatial reasoning.</field><field name="creator">Graham, Charlotte</field><field name="description">Dual Processing theory proposes that the ability to over ride associative (System 1) in favour of analytical (System 2) processed in deductive reasoning may depend on inhibitory control. The present study applies this association to a spatial reasoning task by adapting a mental rotation task to a multichoice format including System 1 (mirror) and System 2 (rotated image) responses. Fifty undergraduate volunteers from the University of Canterbury responded to a Stroop task as a measure of inhibitory control that was compared with System 1 and System 2 responding from a spatial and a deductive reasoning task. It was expected that people with weaker inhibitory potential would make more System 1 and fewer System 2 responses in both deductive and visual-spatial reasoning tasks. Contrary to expectation System 2 responding dominated for both tasks and correlations between both reasoning tasks and measures of inhibitory control were non-significant. The differing idiosyncratic demands of each task may have obscured any common variables associated with inhibitory control.

Climatological cloud amounts from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology  Project (ISCCP) are used in conjunction with wind reanalyses to study orographic  cirrus amounts over the globe. Significant increases in cirrus are seen over many  land areas, with respect to any surrounding oceans. To aid in interpretation of this result  special attention is given to the New Zealand region as a case study for orographic cloud  formation. Cirrus is found be more prevalent over New Zealand when compared to the  adjacent ocean to the west.  ISCCP cloud amounts are also compared with a ten year simulation of the UK Meteorological  Office's Unified Model. The model is found to be considerably lacking in  both cirrus and total high cloud over major mountain ranges. The model is also found to  lack trailing cirrus clouds in the lee of orography despite the inclusion of a prognostic ice  variable capable of being advected by the model winds.  To improve the simulations of orographic cirrus and high cloud in the Unified Model  a linear hydrostatic gravity wave scheme that predicts both the amplitude and phase of  subgrid orographic gravity waves is introduced. The temperature perturbation caused by  these waves in the troposphere is used to modify the amount of both liquid and ice cloud.  One important feature of the parameterisation is that the launch amplitude of the gravity  waves is predicted by a directional variance function which accounts for anisotropy in the  subgrid orography. The parameterisation is explored in the context of an off-line testbed  before implementation in the Unified Model.  In a ten year simulation the parameterisation is found to increase the high cloud  amounts over a number of the world's major mountain ranges. However, this extra cloud  is optically thick and unable to remove the deficiency in optically thin cirrus amounts.  Suggestions, as part of future work, for improvements to the model and orographic cloud  parameterisation are also made.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orographic clouds</field><field name="subject">ISCCP</field><field name="subject">climate modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Decomposition of Nothofagus fusca  Floral and Bark Litter</field><field name="creator">Smaill, Simeon John</field><field name="description">Nutrient cycles and budgets have been calculated for various ecosystems, but the impact of floral and bark litter decomposition on nutrient cycling has been little investigated. In this study, the characteristics and decomposition of floral and bark litter produced by Nothofagus fusca in the Lewis Pass Reserve, New Zealand, was investigated, using both field and laboratory studies. Nothofagus fusca floral litter production in 1999 was 734 &#177; 76 kg ha&#8315;&#185;. Floral production in 2000 was estimated to be approximately 1% of this mass, the considerable difference being due to mast flowering in 1999. The decay rate constant, k, for floral litter in the field was 0.94 &#177; 0.01, and mass loss after one year was estimated to be 61%. The input of nitrogen to the litter layer in Nothofagus fusca floral litter was 12 &#177; 1 kg ha&#8315;&#185;, and it was estimated that 65% of this nitrogen was released from the floral litter in the one year. Phosphorous input to the litter layer through Nothofagus fusca floral litter in 1999 was 0.8 &#177; 0.1 kg ha&#8315;&#185;, of which 69% was released in one year. It was estimated that in 1999 nitrogen and phosphorous inputs to the litter layer through Nothofagus fusca floral litter were 117% and 73% respectively of that through foliar litter. Four types of Nothofagus fusca bark were identified and further differences between bark types were confirmed by chemical analysis. Inner bark contained less nitrogen than outer bark, and was slower to decompose in microcosms, contradicting the findings of other research. Annual nitrogen and phosphorous inputs through the production of all types of Nothofagus fusca bark litter was estimated to be 1.0 kg ha&#8315;&#185; and 0.2 kg ha&#8315;&#185; respectively, although confidence in these values was low. Significant proportions of the nitrogen and phosphorous content in bark were water soluble. Field and laboratory experiments indicated net nitrogen immobilisation occurred in all bark litter types after one year in the field, while net release of phosphorous occurred after one year.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nothfagus fusca</field><field name="subject">bark</field><field name="subject">floral litter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating Transmission Barriers to Escherichia coli x Saccharomyces cerevisiae interkingdom conjugation</field><field name="creator">Haslett, Nicholas David</field><field name="description">Conjugation is a fundamentally important mechanism of horizontal DNA transfer between bacteria, bacteria x archea, and bacteria x eukaryotes. This work has concentrated on conjugation between bacteria x eukaryotes, specifically Escherichia coli x Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four hypotheses were tested, investigating the barriers to this particular form of DNA transfer. The first investigated if a mutation that altered the cell-surface of the recipient S. cerevisiae could inhibit DNA transfer. The final three utilised a recombination-dependent-conjugation assay to investigate the barrier to DNA transmission through recombination. The hypotheses tested if the frequency of recombination, in this recombination-dependent-conjugation assay, differed when using similar or diverged DNA substrates, if a mismatch repair mutation within the recipient could affect the frequencies of recombination observed, and if the position on the plasmid of the gene of interest affected the frequency of transmission.    Transmission of the Ura3 DNA sequence in the recipient S. cerevisiae was used to test all four hypotheses. The cell wall mutants mnn9, knr4, fks1 and kre6 were utilised to investigate if the cell-surface of the recipient could affect the frequency of transmission. The similar and diverged substrates utilised in the investigation of the affect of sequence similarity on recombination were the DNA sequences of ura3 from S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, respectively and the MMR mutants utilised were msh2, pms1 and pol30-52. Cell wall mutants were not found to limit the frequency of transfer once donor-recipient contact was induced through the solid surface mating procedure. Sequence similarity, MMR and the relative position of the ura3 DNA sequence on the conjugative plasmids were shown to have little effect on the frequency of transmission in S. cerevisiae. This suggests that any DNA that enters the nucleus of S. cerevisiae (eukaryotes) can recombine with the chromosome and alter it to the same extent. However, trends within the data also suggest that DNA is transferred into the recipient and then transported to the nucleus to recombine with the chromosome as a single-stranded DNA molecule.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">mismatch repair</field><field name="subject">horizontal gene transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Human Cell as an Environment for Horizontal Gene Transfer</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Gayle Christy</field><field name="description">Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is now indisputably the predominant driving force, if not the sole force, behind speciation and the evolution of novelty in bacteria. Of all mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), conjugation, the contact-dependent plasmid-mediated transfer of DNA from a bacterial donor to a recipient cell, is probably the most universal. First observed between bacteria, conjugation also mediates gene transfer from bacteria to yeast, plant and even animal cells. The range of environments in which bacteria naturally exchange DNA has not been extensively explored. The interior of the animal cell represents a novel and potentially medically relevant environment for gene transfer. Since most antibiotics are ineffective inside mammalian cells, our cells may be a niche for the evolution of resistance and virulence in invasive pathogens. Invading bacteria accumulate in vacuoles inside human cells, protected from antibiotics. Herein, I demonstrate the ability of intracellular Salmonella typhimurium to meet and exchange plasmid DNA by conjugation within animal cells, revealing the animal intracellular milieu as a permissive environment for gene exchange. This finding evokes a model for the simultaneous dissemination of virulence and antibiotic resistance within a niche protected from both antibiotics and the immune system and extends the variety of environments in which bacteria are known to exchange genes.     Unlike conjugation between bacteria, conjugation between bacteria and eukaryotic cells requires the import of transferred DNA into the nucleus before the transferred genes can be expressed and inherited. Plant-cell nuclear transformation by the conjugation system of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid is believed to be mediated by nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) carried within the proteins that accompany the T-DNA during transfer. Whether NLSs are equally important for transmission of other conjugative plasmids to eukaryotic cells is unknown. Herein, I demonstrate nuclear localization potential within the putative conjugative escort protein TraI of the IncPa plasmid RP4. In contrast, MobA, the putative escort protein from the IncQ plasmid RSF1010, lacked any clear nuclear localization potential. It is therefore likely that specific nuclear localization signals within conjugative proteins are not essential for nuclear transformation per se, although they may assist in efficient plasmid transmission.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">horizontal gene transfer</field><field name="subject">conjugation</field><field name="subject">Salmonella typhimurium</field><field name="subject">type IV secretion</field><field name="subject">plasmids</field><field name="subject">virulence</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the relationship between NO, ABA and auxin in lateral root initiation and root elongation in tomato</field><field name="creator">Sivananthan, Malini</field><field name="description">The length of the primary root and the density of lateral roots determine the architecture of the root. In this thesis the effect of NAA, ABA and the NO donor SNP alone as well as the combination of ABA or NAA with SNP on lateral root development was investigated. The interaction between CPTIO, a NO scavenger, and NAA or SNP is also reported.    Following preliminary experiments in which it was observed that the aerial part of the seedling influenced LR growth and that there was a possible inhibitory effect of light on cultured root tips, experiments were conducted with excised roots tips in the dark. NAA was shown to have the potential to initiate LRs across a wide concentration gradient with the total number of LRs and initiated lateral root primordia (LRP) remaining constant across the range of concentrations tested. Over the last decade, nitric oxide (NO), a bioactive molecule, has been reported to be involved in the regulation of many biological pathways. The presence of NO in the system provided via sodium nitroprusside (SNP), promoted LRP initiation based on the NAA concentration gradient; but without changing the total LR initiation, that is LRs plus primordia density remained constant along the concentration gradient of NAA. The absence of LR and LRP in the treatments of CPTIO (a NO scavenger) with SNP or NAA suggests that NO regulates LRP initiation triggered by NAA, which is in agreement with the recent paper published after the commencement of this study (Correa-Aragunde et al., 2006).    In agreement with previous studies, ABA inhibited lateral root development by reducing LR density and the number of LRs. The experiments with fluridone, an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, may indicate that endogenous ABA was at sufficient concentrations in the excised root tips to inhibit primordia initiation. In this study, evidence is presented for the first time to show that SNP can relieve the inhibitory effect of ABA on LR density and number of LRs suggesting the NO, released from SNP, acts downstream of ABA.     Overall these data confirm a critical role for NO in LR initiation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NO</field><field name="subject">ABA</field><field name="subject">auxin</field><field name="subject">lateral root initiation</field><field name="subject">root elongation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Estrogen on the Growth and Tuberization of  Potato Plants (Solanum tuberosum cv. 'Iwa') Grown in  Liquid Tissue Culture Media</field><field name="creator">Brown, Greta Suzanne</field><field name="description">Mammalian estrogens and estrogen-like compounds known as xeno-estrogens are being found in and excreted into the environment in ever increasing amounts. The xeno-estrogen DDE has been found at high concentrations of 1-5 mg/kg of soil (Aislabie et. al, 1997). These estrogens and xeno-estrogens are having a devastating effect on animal-life, yet little is known or understood on the effects of estrogens on plant-life. Thus it is important to determine what effects (if any) estrogens may have on plants. Other research has shown that estrogen has an effect on plants grown in vitro (Janeczko and Skoczowski, 2005). This research aims to help increase the amount of information on what effects estrogens may have on plants. In this study, the effects of mammalian estrogens (17-&#946;-estradiol, estrone and estriol) on the growth and tuberization of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. cv 'Iwa') grown in liquid tissue culture medium are presented. It was found that at even 0.1 mg/L of estrogen, root growth of the plants was diminished and at 10 mg/L of estrogen, plant deformity was apparent and callus growth induced. Acid phosphatase activity of the plants was increased with the addition of 0.1 mg/L and 1 mg/L of estrogen but then decreased with the addition of 10 mg/L of estrogen. Tuber production was slightly reduced in plants treated with estrogen compared to the control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">xeno-estrogen</field><field name="subject">estrone</field><field name="subject">estradiol</field><field name="subject">estriol</field><field name="subject">DDT</field><field name="subject">DDE</field><field name="subject">plant tissue culture</field><field name="subject">potato</field><field name="subject">acid phosphatase</field><field name="subject">estrogen concentrations</field><field name="subject">pollutants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ring laser gain media</field><field name="creator">Graham, Richard Douglas</field><field name="description">This thesis details the design and construction of an experiment to measure the radial distribution of laser gain in a cylindrical Helium-Neon laser gain tube. This distribution is important as it can effect the transverse mode structure of a running ring laser. Earlier theoretical models of the distribution were not supported by high quality experimental data and fail to take into account some physical processes. A resolution of 8 parts per million in gain and 50 &#956;m in radial position has been achieved. Gain distributions have been measured and are shown to be well modeled by a 0th order Bessel function with first roots at the tube walls and a central dip depending on excitation power; except for the region very near to the tube walls where a very rapid increase in gain has been observed. Hydrogen has been identified by spectroscopic analysis as the primary constituent of gas contamination and cause of the long term reduction in gain of large ring lasers. Additional work has been done to detect a proposed non-classical Lense-Thirring field around a spinning lead superconductor. It was found that any effect is at least 20 times smaller than predicted.

Notification data is used by public health professionals and academics to identify cases  requiring public health control, monitor disease incidence and distribution, and in  epidemiological research. However, there is emerging evidence that notification rates do not  accurately reflect the true extent of notifiable diseases within the community, resulting in the  underascertainment of many notifiable cases. While adequate surveillance does not necessarily  require that all cases of notifiable disease be captured, the systematic underascertainment of  disease can have significant implications for perceived spatial and demographic trends in disease  prevalence; potentially threatening the credibility of spatial epidemiological research by under or  overestimating the burden of disease in different populations. There is evidence that systematic  underascertainment occurs as a result of the differential actions of laboratories and general  practitioners. It has also been recognised that that underascertainment can be influenced by a  patient's willingness to seek medical attention and participate in laboratory tests. However, few  studies have investigated whether these factors systematically influence notification either in New  Zealand or overseas. Furthermore, the discipline of health geography has been slow to engage  with this topic of public health importance, despite the inherently spatial nature of the processes  involved, and the close ties to the geographic literature on health service utilization and  healthcare provision.  This thesis explores the spatial and temporal variation in notification rates in New Zealand for the  period 1997-2005 and the potential relationships between notification rates and different  variables. Unlike many underascertainment studies, which have used individual data and  capture-recapture methods, data constraints inspired a unique ecological approach to investigating  the factors which may be associated with notification in New Zealand. Variables were divided  into categories based on Anderson's behavioural model for healthcare utilization and the  influence of these variables on notification was determined through multiple regression analyses.  The main findings of this research indicate that in New Zealand notification rates have increased  during the period 1997-2005 and that there is a north-south gradient in notifications, with  substantially lower rates in the North Island than in the South Island. Furthermore, it is also  evident that the variables associated with notification vary according to disease, spatial  aggregation and spatial scale. Notification rates are significantly associated with a range of  predisposing and enabling factors which might influence patient choice to consult for many  frequently underascertained diseases. More variation in enteric diseases is explained by the  independent variables analysed than the variation in non-enteric diseases. However, further  research into these relationships, and underascertainment in general, is required before firm  conclusions can be drawn.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">underascertainment</field><field name="subject">ascertainment</field><field name="subject">under-reporting</field><field name="subject">infectious disease</field><field name="subject">enteric disease</field><field name="subject">notification</field><field name="subject">notification-bias</field><field name="subject">notifiable disease</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">spatial epidemiology</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple memory systems: contributions of human and animal serial reaction time tasks</field><field name="creator">Christie, Michael Alexander</field><field name="description">Human memory systems have been divided into two broad domains, one responsible for 'declarative memory' and the other for 'non-declarative memory'. The evidence for multiple memory systems is reviewed with respect to the human SRT, a sensitive measure of non-declarative memory. A qualitative review of the human SRT literature concludes that damage to extrapyramidal brain systems disrupts SRT performance whereas limbic system neuropathology (LSN) leaves performance intact. However, a meta-analysis of the SRT literature with neuropathological patients revealed unexpectedly that patients with explicit memory disorders are impaired on the SRT task, although less severely than patients with extrapyramidal damage. Other evidence suggested that the apparent SRT impairment in humans with LSN might be due to the additional pathology (eg frontal) often evident in these patients.  A brief review of the animal evidence for multiple memory systems concluded that, like humans, animals too have multiple memory systems but none of the animal tasks used to model non-declarative memory make good conceptual or behavioural contact with the corresponding human tasks.  Thus a novel animal-analogue of the human-SRT task, the 'fan-maze', was developed.  Although rats displayed a reasonable ability to perform the fan-maze SRT task it was abandoned due to technical and conceptual problems in favour of a better design. The second new SRT task used intra-cranial self-stimulation to promote prolonged, rapid and continuous responding.  A control study determined that the optimal conditions for sequence learning was a single large (2820 trial) session.  Intact rats that experienced a switch from the repeating to a random sequence under these conditions demonstrated a clear interference effect, the primary measure of SRT performance.  A lesion study used these optimal conditions and showed that small caudate lesions impaired, whereas small hippocampal lesions facilitated, rat-SRT performance. Hence, this second task has proven to be a valid animal-analogue of the human SRT task, as rats performed it in a manner similar to that shown by humans and relied on the same neural substrate to perform the task as humans. In addition, this second task resolved the discrepancy of the LSN meta-analysis.  Quantitative findings are reviewed in light of theories and studies presented earlier in the thesis. Limitations of the thesis are identified and suggestions are made as to future SRT research in animals or humans.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">implicity</field><field name="subject">nondeclarative</field><field name="subject">serial</field><field name="subject">reaction</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">meta-analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chironomid-based transfer functions for surface water quality parameters and temperature, and their application to Quaternary sediment records from the South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Woodward, Craig Allan</field><field name="description">This thesis resulted in the development of robust chironomid-based transfer-functions for February mean air temperature and the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) in lake-water. The New Zealand transfer-functions for both variables compare favourably with chironomid-based transfer-functions for equivalent variables from elsewhere in the world, and diatom-based transfer-functions for nutrients and lake production from New Zealand. The application of the temperature and TN transfer-functions provided insight into New Zealand climate conditions during the last glacial and served as validation for the reconstructions. Chironomid-based Temperature reconstructions from lake silts preserved in the banks of Lyndon Stream indicate a maximum cooling of ca 4 &#8451; between 26.6 and 24.5 ka BP, which is consistent with estimates based on beetles and plant macrofossils. A cooling of 4 &#8451; is insufficient to explain the lack of canopy tree pollen in many New Zealand pollen records at this time. Other environmental parameters additional to temperature may have limited the expansion forest cover. The chironomid-based TN reconstructions infer a trend of rapidly deteriorating water-quality in a small doline in north-west Nelson, in the South Island of New Zealand following deforestation immediately surrounding the lake ca. 1970 AD. The overall trend and timing of eutrophication inferred from the chironomids was consistent with other biological proxies and actual observations of changes in lake water quality. The chironomid-based transfer-functions provide a valuable new tool for the study of longterm climate variability and improving our understanding of the response of aquatic ecosystems to long-term natural and human induced environmental change in New Zealand lakes. I have identified some possibilities for future research which should improve the performance of these transfer-functions. The improvement of the chironomid taxonomy and the expansion of the training set should be the highest priorities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chironomid</field><field name="subject">paleolimnology</field><field name="subject">transfer-function</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Quaternary</field><field name="subject">Holocene</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">lakes</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">Lake Forsyth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Record of Environmental and Climatic Change  from the West Coast, South Island, New Zealand,  using Beetle Fossils</field><field name="creator">Burge, Philip Ian</field><field name="description">Fossil beetle based palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions are presented from the Westport region, West Coast, South Island, New Zealand for the last glacial cycle. They include the longest continuous fossil beetle record from New Zealand, covering 16,000 years over the OIS 3/OIS 2 transition. Early last glacial (OIS 4) and mid- Holocene (OIS 1) reconstructions are also presented. The assumptions underlying fossil beetle research in New Zealand are tested indicating beetles are suitable proxies for reconstructing palaeotemperature and palaeoprecipitation. This thesis provides the first quantitative estimates of temperature and precipitation from the Westport region for the last glacial. Reconstructed temperatures indicate stadial cooling was seasonal. Maximum cooling was ca. 5&#8451; in winter and ca. 2-3&#8451; in summer. Winter cooling is consistent with previous quantitative estimates from New Zealand. Mean annual precipitation decreased a maximum 35-40% during stadials. Temperatures and precipitation varied during OIS 3/2 indicating multiple possible drivers for glaciation. A glacial advance ca. 34-28ka BP correlates with ca. 5&#8451; winter cooling and ca. 40% less precipitation, which supports temperature driven glaciation whereas a glacial advance ca. 24-22ka BP correlates with ca. 3&#8451; winter cooling and precipitation similar to present, which supports precipitation forced glaciation. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of stadial vegetation from the Westport region indicate lowland Nothofagus fusca-type forest during OIS 4 and a forest-grassland mosaic during OIS 3/2. These records contrast with pollen-based reconstructions of a treeless landscape in Westport during stadials but are consistent with quantitative estimates of stadial cooling. A shift of reproductive strategy in arboreal vegetation may explain the lack of tree pollen in stadial pollen records. This is significant for our understanding of glacial palaeoecology and palaeoclimatology as pollen records may not accurately represent stadial vegetation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beetle fossils</field><field name="subject">quaternary</field><field name="subject">glacial climate</field><field name="subject">glacial environment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects Of Forestry Management Practices on Microbial Community Properties</field><field name="creator">Smaill, Simeon John</field><field name="description">The structure and function of microbial communities are critical to the maintenance and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystem processes. Consequently, there is substantial interest in assessing how microbial communities respond to various land management practices, and if alterations to the characteristics of microbial communities has the potential to disrupt ecosystem processes. This thesis was conducted to identify the long term effects of fertilisation and different levels of post-harvest organic matter removal on the characteristics of the FH litter and soil microbial communities in six, second rotation Pinus radiata plantation forests located around New Zealand.  The six sites, established between 1986 and 1994, were sampled in 2002 and 2003. Various physical and chemical properties of the sites were measured, and litterfall production was determined. The microbial biomass in the FH litter layer and soil was determined by chloroform fumigation-extraction, and Biolog plates were used to assess the relative differences in microbial community diversity, based on patterns of substrate utilisation.  Fertilisation substantially altered the physical and chemical properties of the forest floor, including FH litter moisture content, mass, carbon content, nitrogen content and carbon: nitrogen ratio and soil pH, nitrogen content and carbon: nitrogen ratio. The same range of FH litter and soil properties were also significantly changed by different levels of organic matter removal. The biomass and diversity of the FH litter and soil microbial communities were significantly altered by fertilisation and organic matter removal, and the differences in the microbial community characteristics were significantly correlated to the effects of the fertilisation and organic matter removal treatments on the physical and chemical environment in the majority of cases. The physical and chemical properties of the sites were significantly correlated to estimates of wood production, and it was also found that the characteristics of the microbial community were strongly related to productivity at several sites.  The results demonstrated that fertilisation and organic matter removal regimes have had long term effects on the microbial communities at the sites. The persistence of the effects of the organic matter removal treatments were particularly noteworthy, as these treatments were applied at site establishment, and despite no subsequent reinforcement over the life of the trials, were still substantially influencing the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of the FH litter and soil up to 17 years later. The results of this thesis also emphasised the value of long-term experiments in assessing the effects of disturbance on the physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of forest ecosystems. Further research into the specific nature of the relationship between site productivity and microbial community characteristics was suggested as an important focus for future studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic matter removal; fertilisation; microbial biomass; microbial community structure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiral Heterocyclic Ligands</field><field name="creator">Lewis, William</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the preparation and characterisation of a number of homochiral coordination and metallosupramolecular assemblies. These species were formed from the reaction of chiral pyridine and quinoline containing ligands and metal ions. The combination of traditional coordination chemistry and supramolecular interactions led to a range of polymeric and network structures being formed.    The ligands used in this thesis can be divided into two broad categories: alkaloids and ligands derived from them, and amino acid-based ligands. In the first category three new ligands were synthesized, and a variety of routes towards alkaloid-based homochiral ligands were investigated. The second category focused on three ligand motifs, and resulted in the preparation of 16 ligands. These two categories of ligands were reacted with a range of metal salts to investigate their coordination and supramolecular chemistry.    The structure of twenty complexes was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The complexes had a range of structures, with discrete and polymeric species being formed. Hydrogen bonding was an important feature in the supramolecular chemistry of the complexes, playing a different role in different series of complexes.    Two chiral coordination polymers and one chiral coordination network were synthesized. All three of these structures possessed directionality to some degree: in the coordination network and one of the polymers the directionality is counterbalanced by the opposite directionality being present in the crystal, while the second coordination polymer is generated by the screw axis present and has a high degree of overall directionality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chiral ligands</field><field name="subject">heterocyclic ligands</field><field name="subject">supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">coordination chemistry</field><field name="subject">X-ray crystallography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotion-Focussed Psychoeducational Group Therapy for Binge Eating Disorder in Women and Men.</field><field name="creator">Clyne, Courtney</field><field name="description">A plethora of research has linked negative affect with binge eating in people with binge eating disorder (BED). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) have not traditionally addressed emotional regulation deficits. Failure to address emotional aspects of binge eating may explain why some individuals do not respond to CBT or IPT, and why many of those who do respond relapse shortly after finishing treatment. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) specifically targets the inability to accurately recognise and regulate affect. Preliminary investigations have shown that DBT may be efficacious in treating BED. However, it can take up to 10 months, and a shorter intervention targeting affect regulation and recognition may produce similar effects.     Four studies evaluating a ten session emotion-focussed group psychoeducational intervention for BED were conducted. In the first, 25 women diagnosed with subthreshold or full syndrome BED (using DSM-IV-TR criteria) were treated. The second study tested whether the specific components of the intervention, or the treatment as a whole, was required to produce positive outcomes in women. Study three, examined the efficacy of the treatment programme with three men diagnosed with subthreshold or full syndrome BED (also using DSM-IV-TR criteria). The fourth study compared the women's and men's response to treatment.    Following the intervention with women, binge abstinence rates, comparable to those of CBT and IPT, and various other positive changes to eating and general pathology, were observed. These effects were well-maintained up to one-year later. Overall, it was concluded that the whole treatment programme was necessary to produce the optimum outcome for BED in women. A positive outcome was measured in the men, although the effects were not as dramatic as those found in the women. Suggestions for improvements, and suggestions for further research, are discussed. The results provide support for the Affect Regulation Model of BED in women and men.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">binge eating disorder (BED)</field><field name="subject">emotion-focussed treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nano Scale Cluster Devices</field><field name="creator">Reichel, Ren&#233;</field><field name="description">This study uses clusters formed in a UHV-compatible cluster apparatus, which was built and commissioned during this thesis. The design and operation of the cluster deposition system is described. This system is optimised for high clus- ter fluxes and for the production of cluster assembled nanoscale devices. One key feature of the system is a high degree of flexibility, including interchangeable sputtering and inert gas aggregation sources, and two kinds of mass spectrome- ter, which allow both characterisation of the cluster size distribution and deposi- tion of mass-selected clusters. Another key feature is that clusters are deposited onto electrically contacted lithographically defined devices mounted on an UHV- compatible cryostat cold finger, allowing deposition at room temperature as well as at cryogenic and at elevated temperatures. The electrically contacted nanoscale cluster devices were fabricated using a novel template technique. Hereby, clusters are placed between two electrodes separated only by &#8764;100 nm. The width of the cluster ensemble is in the order of a few cluster diameters, which means that the assembled clusters form a cluster wire bridging the electrode separation. During this thesis, the design and layout has been optimised to be able to measure electrical properties of the cluster devices and in particular to investigate the interaction between the cluster ensemble and the contact electrodes. In-situ electrical characterisation of cluster assembled nanoscale devices are performed in the temperature range 4.2 K to 375 K. The samples are provided with a backgate, which in principle allows modification of the conduction through the cluster ensemble by applying a gate voltage. However, no change in conduc- tion with changes in gate voltages was seen. The main focus of the electrical measurements is on the current voltage char- acteristics. It was noticed that the nanoscale bismuth (and antimony) cluster devices exhibited non-linear current voltage characteristics, which were in stark contrast to the linear current voltage characteristics measured for cluster films previously. Investigations into the causes of this non-linearity suggests that tun- nelling conduction occurs between the cluster ensemble (wire) and the contact electrodes. The non-linear current voltage characteristics were fitted using three models of tunnelling conduction and appear to be best fitted using a model in- volving fluctuation-assisted tunnelling through barriers of different heights. Further, measurements of the temperature dependent resistance are performed showing an increase of resistance with decreasing temperature for bismuth and antimony assembled cluster devices. The temperature dependence of bismuth as- sembled cluster wires can be explained by the decrease of the carrier concentration in bismuth for decreasing temperature. Annealing of the cluster ensemble and the cluster contact connection resulted in an increase in conduction. This increase of conduction can be explained due to the current flow through the cluster wire. Locally, at the bottlenecks, the current flow causes resistive heating and subsequently coalescence of two (or more) clusters.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UHV</field><field name="subject">cluster</field><field name="subject">bismuth</field><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">tunnelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Onsager heat of transport at the liquidvapour  interface of p-tert-butyltoluene</field><field name="creator">Biggs, Georgina Aimee</field><field name="description">The Onsager heat of transport for p-tert-butyltoluene was measured, as part of a series of preliminary experiments towards the determination of the importance of temperature gradients on the air-sea flux of carbon dioxide. The results presented in this thesis imply that the temperature gradient is a major contributor to the magnitude of the air-sea flux. The heat of transport has been measured for the p-tert-butyltoluene system by measuring stationary-state pressure changes for known temperature differences on the vapour side of the interface. At the pressure ranges used the number of mean free paths was always outside the Knudsen zone, but the values of Q* were approximately 100 % of the latent heat of vaporisation. Departures from linearity of plots of P against &#916;T are attributed to temperature jumps at the surface of the dry upper plate. Both the results taken for p-tert-butyltoluene and the earlier results for water from this laboratory fit to a Type III BET isotherm, where the c parameter is not constant. They also reveal the importance of the temperature gradient in determining the value of the thermal accommodation coefficient, and provide a new method of measuring thermal accommodation coefficients for a variety of surfaces and vapours</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irreversible thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">Onsager</field><field name="subject">gas-liquid interface</field><field name="subject">BET adsorption isotherms</field><field name="subject">p-tButyl Toluene</field><field name="subject">Onsager heat of transport</field><field name="subject">thermal accommodation coefficient</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Snow storage modelling in the Lake Pukaki catchment, New Zealand: an investigation of enhancements to the snowsim model</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Timothy Ross</field><field name="description">The quantity of seasonal snow stored in the Lake Pukaki catchment, New Zealand has a significant impact on the country's economy through its influence on hydroelectricity generation, tourism, agriculture and conservation. SnowSim is a snow storage model developed for New Zealand conditions that may be used to quantify the catchment's frozen water resource and the melt water derived from that resource. Through implementation on a geographic information system, SnowSim has been applied and optimised to the Lake Pukaki catchment. The optimal parameters found were: temperature-elevation lapse rate of 0.005 &#8451; m&#8315;&#185;, snow/rain temperature threshold of 2.5 &#8451;, and a melt to temperature relationship factor ranging from 1 to 6 mm &#8451;&#8315;&#185; d&#8315;&#185;. The melt to temperature relationship factor is significantly reduced from that previously used for a New Zealand wide application of SnowSim. Use of a daily measured lapse rate was found to provide no improvement to the model, considered to be because of the spatial variability of lapse rates. Inclusion of a radiation component also provided no improvement in the model. This is contrary to the experience found in similar model applications in other regions of the world. The lower relative importance of radiation melt (with regard to total melt) in the region compared to continental l&#8451;ations may explain this result. The use of a new precipitation distribution system did improve model results. Daily precipitation measurements were related to a new annual average precipitation surface prior to interpolating them across the region, without any elevation to precipitation relationship. Model free water results required an offset adjustment to bring them into line with measured lake inflows limiting the application of the model to estimation of seasonal variation, relative magnitudes and event frequencies of snow storage. Over four years of data a model output quality criterion of 0.61 (where a value of 1 is a perfect model) was returned. This increased to 0.76 for monthly values indicating a high quality of output at the seasonal scale. Model parameters and output quality are in line with those found using comparable models for various applications around the world. The variety of outputs available from the model provide a valuable resource for applications in the electricity, tourism, conservation and agriculture industries as well as for climate, glacier, snow and mountain research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">snow</field><field name="subject">Pukaki</field><field name="subject">Aoraki</field><field name="subject">Cook</field><field name="subject">ice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of protein cross-linking in soy food texture</field><field name="creator">Md. Yasir, Suhaimi Bin</field><field name="description">Cross-linking in soy proteins is hypothesised to have an impact on the texture of tofu. In vitro incubation showed soy proteins and its two fractions, glycinin and &#946;-conglycinin, were cross-linked using glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and transglutaminase (TGA). Increasing concentration of these carbonyl compounds and TGA, and temperature of the carbonyl compounds treatment, increased the reactivity of cross-linking. Glutaraldehyde was the most reactive in forming aggregated proteins, followed by formaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Both carbonyl moieties of glutaraldehyde are believed to be essential for the rapid cross-linking reaction. In the unfractionated soy proteins, &#946;-conglycinin had a higher reactivity than glycinin. In in vitro incubation using TGA, soy proteins served as good substrates for TGA, in which &#946;-conglycinin was more susceptible to TGA than glycinin in the unfractionated soy proteins. The addition of TGA, and 1 and 2 mM glutaraldehyde prior to soymilk boiling in situ resulted in a small number of cross-linked proteins, which correspond to an increase in fracture force. The addition of glutaraldehyde after soymilk boiling resulted in a slight decrease in fracture force compared to the control. At higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde (15 and 30 mM), soy proteins were mostly cross-linked, regardless of addition before or after soymilk boiling. Highly cross-linked proteins resulted in a significant decrease in the fracture force. For TGA treatment, the fracture force was increased with increasing TGA concentration from 1000 to 5000 ppm, added either before or after soymilk boiling. However, the TGA treatment showed only a small quantity of cross-linking. It is hypothesised that TGA hydrolysed glutamine of proteins to glutamate and changed the functional properties of proteins. Upon examination of the microstructure, it was found that the TGA treatment resulted in a fine-stranded network, compact structure and less porosity. These characteristics resulted in a higher fracture force. In contrast, in the glutaraldehyde treatment, the network consisted of a higher porosity, loose network and diffuse structure, which gave lower fracture force. Thus, it appears that substrate modification to the structure of the soy proteins may have a greater impact than the number of cross-links. These findings are likely to have implications for production of soy products with a wide range of textures by manipulating the soy protein properties.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soy proteins</field><field name="subject">glycinin</field><field name="subject">b-conglycinin</field><field name="subject">cross-linking</field><field name="subject">Maillard-type</field><field name="subject">transglutaminase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the relationship between oral narrative ability and reading comprehension in children with mixed reading disability</field><field name="creator">Westerveld, Marleen Frederike</field><field name="description">Oral narrative ability has received increasing attention over the past three decades, and the importance of children's oral narrative skills to academic achievement has been well established. Children with reading disabilities are known to demonstrate difficulties in the ability to produce and comprehend oral narratives (Roth &amp; Spekman, 1986; Snyder &amp; Downey, 1991). However, the nature of the relationship between oral narrative ability and reading comprehension performance in children with reading disability is not clear. The experiments reported in this thesis aim to address this issue. The following questions are asked: 1) Do deficits in oral narrative ability contribute to reading comprehension difficulties? and 2) What is the likely direction of the relationship between aspects of oral narrative ability and reading comprehension performance in children with reading disabilities?   Fourteen children (aged between 6;4 and 7;8 at the initial assessment) with mixed reading disability (MRD: i.e., children who demonstrate both word recognition and listening comprehension deficits) participated in the study. Their oral narrative skills were compared to those of their chronological age-matched peers with typical development (TD) and their reading-age-matched peers with typical development (RMTD). The study consisted of three phases: 1) A longitudinal phase in which the children's oral narrative performance was assessed on three occasions over a two-year period; 2) An intervention phase (using a nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design) in which 10 children participated in an oral narrative intervention program that focused on enhancing children's story structure knowledge; and 3) A follow-up assessment phase conducted eight months post-intervention. Oral narratives were elicited in a personal narrative context and in a story retelling context. Oral narrative production ability was analysed at macrostructure (story quality) and microstructure (morpho-syntax and vocabulary) levels. Oral narrative comprehension was assessed in a fictional story context through questions relating to story structure elements. Reading comprehension performance was assessed using a standardised test of reading ability.   The results from the longitudinal study showed that the children with MRD demonstrated inferior oral narrative production and oral narrative comprehension performance compared to their peers with typical reading development at each assessment occasion. When comparing the poor readers' performance to the RMTD group at the third assessment trial, the results suggested that the children with MRD demonstrated a specific deficit in oral narrative comprehension. In contrast, a pattern of delay was observed on the microstructure measures of oral narrative performance. The results from the intervention indicated significant treatment effects with large effect sizes for oral narrative comprehension performance. Despite this improvement in oral narrative comprehension, there was little change in oral narrative production ability, and transfer to reading comprehension was not evident. Although the follow-up assessment indicated sustained improvement in oral narrative comprehension for the children with MRD, accelerated reading comprehension progress was not evident. The findings from the longitudinal case study highlighted the benefits of oral narrative intervention for a child considered at high risk of continuing academic difficulties.    This thesis provides evidence of the persistent oral narrative difficulties in children with MRD. The findings also provide support for the importance of narrative structure knowledge to these poor readers' oral narrative comprehension performance. The results demonstrate that oral narrative comprehension ability explains only a small amount of the variance in reading comprehension performance. Rather, the persistent word recognition difficulties of the children with MRD exert the biggest influence on their reading comprehension performance. These results are discussed in terms of current models of reading and language development. Implications for clinical practice are also addressed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oral narrative ability</field><field name="subject">reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">spontaneous language sampling</field><field name="subject">reading disability</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative X-ray Structure Analyses of Multidentate Transition Metal Complexes</field><field name="creator">Flood, Kelly-Jayne</field><field name="description">The biological significance of macrocyclic complexes has been recognized since they were first synthesized by Neil Curtis. They have the potential to play a critical role in mimicking metalloprotein active sites. Nine Curtis macrocyclic complexes have been studied using X-ray crystallographic techniques. Their structures have been solved and comparisons of the results have been made. Biological importance is also true of the macrocyclic counterpart; side-off and end-off compartmental ligands. In some circumstances these types of ligands are more appropriate because they have extra flexibility due to their pendant arms not being fixed in place by another head-unit, like a traditional macrocycle. The synthesis of a proposed compartmental ligand; 2,2-(N,N&#700;-bis(benzimidazole-2-ylmethyl)methylamine-5,5&#700;-di-tert-butyl-3,3&#700;methanediyl-dibenzyl alcohol (Ligand 1(L1)), has been proposed and outlined. The pendant arms: bis(benzimidazole-2-ylmethyl)amine (BBIM), were successfully synthesized and characterized with 1H NMR, IR and X-ray crystallography. The head-unit: 5,5&#700;-Di-tert-butyl-2,2&#700;-dihydroxy-3,3&#700;-methanediyl-dibenzene methanol (DHTMBA), of L1 was synthesized and characterized using 1H NMR, IR and mass spectrometry. A similar head-unit; 5,5&#700;-Di-methyl-2,2&#700;-dihydroxy-3,3&#700;-methanediyl-dibenzene methanol (DHMMBA), was synthesized in an effort to shorten the synthetic time of the head-unit. This was consequently converted to the chlorine analogue; 3,3&#700;-Bis(chloromethyl)-5,5&#700;-dimethyl-2,2&#700;-methane-diyldiphenol (Cl-DHMMB), and characterized with 1H NMR, IR and X-ray crystallography. Efforts were made to synthesize Ligand 1, but due to synthetic difficulties and time restraints this proved unsuccessful.

A multi-disciplinary approach is taken to address various aspects of this issue. An introduction to xenoestrogens, including international research priorities, wildlife and human health effects, mechanisms of action, structure activity relationships and additivity of estrogenic effects is provided as background information.  An assessment of exposure to a range of naturally occurring and synthetic estrogenic compounds found in food is derived in Chapter 2. The assessment combines new and existing data on food concentration, food consumption and serum levels for each xenoestrogen. Exposure is combined with relative estrogenic potency data from published bioassasy data to estimate risk relative to normal circulating levels of estradiol.  Assuming additivity of xenoestrogens, for an average New Zealand male and for post-menopausal women, xenoestrogens in the diet contribute an additional 12-90% of estrogenicity above normal circulating levels. For a pre-menopausal female, the contribution from the diet represents in the order of an additional 2%. The level of exposure determined in this thesis would seem to be of pharmacological relevance, especially for men with low levels of estrogen and for post-menopausal women.  Bisphenol A (BPA) is an important monomer used in the manufacture of epoxy resins for internal food can linings. A survey of the BPA content of a range of 80 canned foods available to the New Zealand consumer was undertaken and the results used in the exposure and risk assessments. BPA was detected in all foods analysed except soft drinks, at concentrations ranging from &lt;10-29 &#181;g/kg, except for individual samples of tuna, corned beef and coconut cream that were 109, 98 and 191 &#181;g/kg respectively. None, of over 4000 individual exposure scenarios, exceeded the temporary Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 10 &#181;g/kg body weight per day set by the Scientific Committee on Food in 2002.  Intestinal microflora influence the bioavailability of the naturally occurring xenoestrogens genistein and daidzein that contribute significantly to total estrogenicity from the diet. The  degradation of genistein and daidzein by the faecal microfloral of 5 human subjects was variable and unpredictable between individuals and within an individual. These findings have important implications for the promotion and prescription of soy foods and supplements for disease prevention and health benefits.  The "yeast assay" is one of a number of methods available to measure estrogenicity. This assay was established and validated. In utero exposure to estrogenic compounds at critical periods of sexual differentiation and endocrine development may imprint for health effects observed later in life. Placental transfer of estrogenicity, from 17&#946;-estradiol was studied using the human placental perfusion model and the yeast assay. The placenta provides a protective barrier to the transfer of estrogenicity. Experiments with genistein showed that 5-15% placental transfer occurred, suggesting that in utero exposure might be in the order of 10% of maternal exposure.  The thesis concludes with consideration of a genomic approach to substantiate, or refute, the mechanistic link between exposure to xenoestrogens and claimed human health effect. Such an approach offers exciting opportunity to clarify the mode of action of the synthetic versus the naturally occurring xenoestrogens, to confirm or dispute additivity of effect that is an important premise of the exposure assessment, to identify key genes involved in the many possible health effects and thence risk to the individual from dietary exposure to xenoestrogens.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estrogenicity</field><field name="subject">xenoestrogens</field><field name="subject">genistein</field><field name="subject">daidzein</field><field name="subject">bisphenol A</field><field name="subject">human dietary exposure</field><field name="subject">canned food</field><field name="subject">gut microflora</field><field name="subject">placental transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How mitochondrial DNA mutations affect the growth of MCF-7 clones</field><field name="creator">Sin, Yuan Yan (Angie)</field><field name="description">Mitochondria are the main sites for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation within most cells. Structural and functional alterations of mitochondria due to genetic abnormalities of mitochondria can cause respiratory chain dysfunction. In this study, the important role of mitochondria in energy metabolism was determined by comparing the effect of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations on growth patterns and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activities of six isolated clones (B5, B12, D4, D9, E1 and E8); as well as the effect of ATP supplement to culture using the slowest growing clone. The isolated clones had shown distinct growth pattern and morphology. The difference in proliferation rates among the clones was ascertained by the doubling times (B5=26.4h. B12=43.2h. D4=25.7h. D9=33.6h. E1=26.9h and E8=28.8h). The clone's slow growth rate was likely the result of mitochondrial mutations in the 16S rRNA gene, ND1, ND4, ND6 and COX III. Five heteroplasmic mutations were found in clone B12 (G2480T, C2513G, A2520T, C9527T and C14263G), one heteroplasmic mutation in clone D9 (A4137G) and one homoplasmic mutation in clone D4 (C11496). The mutations in clone B12 appeared to be deleterious to the cell by disrupting mitochondrial OXPHOS activities and reducing energy output. Additionally, extracellular ATP supplement to OXPHOS deficient clone B12 facilitated cell growth and enhances the gene expression. Increased expression of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain complexes observed in clone B12 compared to clone D4 may reflect mitochondrial genomic adaptation to perturbations in cellular energy requirements. The stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis may be a cellular response in compensation for defects in OXPHOS associated with mtDNA mutations. My data support the hypothesis that the variability in functional manifestations of mtDNA is attributed to the nature of the mutation, number of mutation and the gene specifically affected.

The present experiments investigate the effect of WM load on distractor interference when the relevant and irrelevant information is part of the same object. In two experiments, participants saw stimulus displays that consisted of a memory set followed by a Stroop color stimulus. The tasks were to respond to the color of the stimulus first and then to a memory probe. The principal manipulations were the relationship between the color and meaning of the Stroop stimulus (neutral vs. incongruent) and the level of WM load (high vs. low). The results show that WM load had little effect on the magnitude of Stroop interference. These results were consistent with previous research which shows that WM load plays a limited role in the efficiency of selective attention when the extent of attentional focus was held constant across different WM load conditions. They also emphasize the importance of stimulus structure in understanding selective attention in general, and distractor processing in particular.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">Stroop Interference Effect</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the relationship between anxiety and normal and pathological dissociative experiences</field><field name="creator">Harris, Jacqueline Karen Joy</field><field name="description">Dissociation may be broadly described as a subjective experience in which information from the individual's internal or external environment is not appropriately integrated into conscious awareness, memory or identity. A number of studies have found an association between dissociative experience and anxious arousal, and in particular, between dissociation and trauma. Recent reviews suggest the existence of an unspecified mediating variable that accounts for these associations. The present study compared dissociative experiences reported by a community sample (N = 74) and a sample of individuals with a range of anxiety disorders (N = 20). The potential influence of anxiety sensitivity was a particular focus. Participants completed a battery of measures assessing dissociative experience, anxious arousal, social anxiety, generalised anxiety, panic and agoraphobia, traumatic experience and posttraumatic stress in addition to measures of anxiety sensitivity and substance use. Participants in the anxiety group reported a greater variety and frequency of dissociative experiences, particularly of experiences considered to be pathological in nature. Elevated dissociation scores were associated with somatic symptoms of anxiety, social anxiety, generalised anxiety, agoraphobia and posttraumatic stress. No association between trauma exposure and dissociation was evident; however, trauma intensity was associated with dissociation in the anxiety group. Symptoms of depersonalisation / derealisation and absorption were most strongly associated with increased anxiety. Anxiety Sensitivity accounted for more of the variance in dissociation scores than did measures of expressed anxiety. These results suggest that anxiety sensitivity may account for the relationship between trauma anxiety and dissociation.  Therapeutic intervention directed at anxiety sensitivity, particularly fear of cognitive discontrol, may prove helpful in treating dissociative detachment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dissociation</field><field name="subject">anxiety disorders</field><field name="subject">anxiety sensitivity</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposure to Childhood Physical Abuse and Later Parenting Outcomes</field><field name="creator">Chesney, Anna Rose</field><field name="description">Data from a prospective, longitudinal study of a birth cohort of over 1000 New Zealanders was used to examine the relationships between the level of childhood physical abuse a young person is exposed to during childhood (birth to 16 years), and a range of later parenting outcomes in young adulthood. To address this issue, three questions were considered. First, the study examined risk factors that contribute to an early transition to parenthood. Second, this study investigated the current family circumstances of contemporary young parents and their families. And finally, the association between childhood physical abuse and later parenting outcomes was examined. All members of the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) who had become parents by age 25 (112 women and 55 men) were included in the study. To be eligible for inclusion cohort members had to be either biological parents or actively involved in the parenting of non-biological children on a regular basis. Exposure to childhood physical abuse (CPA) was measured at ages 18 and 21 based on cohort member's retrospective reports. At age 25, a parenting interview was conducted which included the following measures of parenting: the Conflict-Tactics Scale (CTS-PC; Straus, Hamby, Finkelhor, Moore, &amp; Runyan, 1998), Dunn scales of positivity and negativity (Dunn, Deater-Deckard, Pickering, &amp; Golding, 1999), the Parenting Practices Questionnaire (PPQ; Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, &amp; Hart, 1995), HOME ratings of responsivity and avoidance of punishment (Caldwell &amp; Bradley, 1979), and interviewer ratings of parental warmth, sensitivity, and child management (Quinton, Rutter, &amp; Liddle, 1984). Findings showed that parents who experienced higher levels of punishment whilst growing up were more negative and less positive towards their own children, were more accepting of the use of physical discipline, and scored lower on warmth, sensitivity and child management compared to those with lower levels of exposure to childhood physical abuse. These findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of childhood physical abuse on later parenting outcomes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical Abuse</field><field name="subject">Parenting Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Family Violence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Narcissism and Escalation in Aggression</field><field name="creator">Takenouchi, Minako</field><field name="description">Research has linked narcissism to a tendency for becoming aggressive based on the perspective that narcissistic people are more prone to ego-threats and more prone to responding defensively to those ego-threats. Also, recent research has been examining the propensity for aggression to escalate as a means to justify prior aggression. This study examined the relationship between narcissism and escalation in aggression and possible mediators of increased aggression. If highly narcissistic individuals are more vulnerable to ego-threats and in turn justify their actions more, then their aggression might escalate more. To examine this, sixty-seven subjects who completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory prior to the laboratory session were assigned to two groups using a bug-extermination method (though no bugs were actually killed) developed by Martens and his colleagues (in press). They either killed one or five bugs initially and then conducted a subsequent bug-killing task in which they controlled the number of bugs they killed. As predicted, participants who killed five bugs initially killed more bugs during the subsequent bug-extermination task than those who killed only one bug initially. Contrary to predictions, no effects of or interactions of narcissism with the initial bug-killing manipulation emerged. We did find, however, that a subtype of narcissism, that is superiority, affected the self-paced 20 seconds bug-killing behaviour. The limitations, further directions, and implications of this study are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aggression</field><field name="subject">narcissism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observations of Middle  Atmosphere Dynamics over  Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Baumgaertner, Andreas Josef Gerhard</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the dynamics of the middle atmosphere over  the southern-most continent on our planet, Antarctica. Building on previous  observational and theoretical efforts to understand the dynamics of this region of  the atmosphere, the work encompasses instrument improvements as well as data  analysis studies of gravity waves in the lower and middle stratosphere, tides in  the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and short-period planetary waves  in the stratosphere and mesosphere.  An upgrade of the Medium-Frequency Spaced Antenna (MFSA) radar at Scott  Base, Antarctica, was carried out in 2004/5 in order to ensure continued operation  and enhance its capabilities to measure gravity waves. As a result, the quality of  the wind measurements was greatly enhanced and the amount of data collected is  now greater by a factor of approximately 15 compared with before the upgrade.  Analysis of over two decades of wind velocity data from Scott Base yields a reliable  climatology of the dynamics of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere  in this area, namely the tidal oscillations and the background winds. In addition,  interannual variability is assessed and periodicities of approximately 11 years and  strong positive trends in tidal amplitudes are reported. Mechanisms that could  explain the observed behaviour are proposed. The data are then combined with  wind measurements from Halley, the longitudinal conjugate site, in order to study  the zonal character of the semi-diurnal tide. Zonal wavenumber 1 and 2 waves are  both found and mechanisms that could explain the generation of a wavenumber 1  component are suggested. Two further sets of MFSA radar wind measurements  are used to investigate the behaviour of planetary waves with periods of between  two and four days in the Antarctic middle atmosphere. Satellite temperature  measurements further help to create a more complete picture of these waves.  Baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, which result from shears of the zonal wind,  appear to be responsible for much of the observed wave activity. In addition, a  quasi-to day wave event in mid-May 2005 with unusually large amplitudes is  examined and suggested to be linked to a solar proton event.  Gravity wave activity over Antarctica is studied using temperature profiles  obtained through the satellite radio occultation technique. Although the measurements  are restricted to below 35 km altitude, high-resolution temperature  profiles allow conclusions to be drawn about the seasonal, geographical, and  height distribution of gravity wave activity. Mountain waves are found to be  important over the Antarctic Peninsula and the Transantarctic mountains where  they contribute more than 20% of the observed wave activity in the lower stratosphere.  In addition, the analysis indicates the importance of critical-level filtering  and Doppler-shifting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Remote Sensing</field><field name="subject">Atmospheric Waves</field><field name="subject">Tides</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Simulated Cellular Phone Conversation on Road-Crossing Safety</field><field name="creator">Murray, Stephen James</field><field name="description">The effects that cellular (cell) phone conversation may have on pedestrian road-crossing performance is unknown. A series of experiments was conducted using a virtual reality road crossing simulator to examine this issue. The participants were primarily university students aged between 18 and 24 years old, although one study compared a group aged 18 to 24 to a group between 50 and 67 years old. Two experimental situations were used: a gap-choice situation, in which the participants had to choose a gap to cross through; and an infrequency situation, where vehicles were present on only 10% of the trials. Participants were impaired by a simulated phone conversation task when compared to no-conversation task, as evidenced by longer reaction times, slower walking speeds, poorer gap choices, and more cautious behaviours. Most importantly, conversation was related to a decrease in the mean margins of safety, and the participants were hit or nearly hit by vehicles more often when talking. The general performance of the older participants did not differ from that of the younger participants, and both groups were impaired to a similar extent by the conversation task. Participants were found to use irrelevant distance information to inform their gap-choice decisions, a strategy associated with a decrease in safety as the distance between the vehicles increased. It was also found that their use of time-to-arrival information was impaired when engaged in the conversation task. Overall, talking on a cell phone while crossing a road may represent an unnecessary increase in risk; therefore, care should be taken if these two acts are being conducted concurrently.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular Phone</field><field name="subject">Mobile Phone</field><field name="subject">Road-Crossing</field><field name="subject">Divided Attention</field><field name="subject">Dual-Task</field><field name="subject">Pedestrian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing Tamariki: How Suitable is the PPVT-III?</field><field name="creator">Haitana, Tracy Nicola</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, M&#257;ori currently experience the "poorest health status of any ethnic group" characterised by high rates of physical and mental illness, educational underachievement, unemployment, criminal incarceration, and low socioeconomic status (Durie, 1998; Ministry of Health, 1999, 2002a, p. 2). Despite attempts to reduce the disparities between M&#257;ori and other New Zealanders, M&#257;ori continue to have a lower life expectancy than non-M&#257;ori (Durie, 1998; Reid, 1999). M&#257;ori children show similar levels of disadvantage experiencing high rates of illness and preventable death (Ministry of Health, 1998). M&#257;ori children also achieve poorly in educational settings, with literacy levels and overall involvement in education found to be below that of non-M&#257;ori (Ministry of Education, 2003a). Research findings have identified that health and educational disparities may be explained in part, by a mismatch between current approaches to practice and service delivery, and the values, beliefs, and experiences of M&#257;ori (Phillips, McNaughton, &amp; MacDonald, 2004). In line with such findings, a number of standardised psychometric tests developed outside of New Zealand, have also been found to produce culturally biased results when used with M&#257;ori (Ogden, 2003; Ogden &amp; McFarlane-Nathan, 1997). The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) is one such test which is currently used in New Zealand to measure receptive vocabulary skills (Stockman, 2000). This research investigated the suitability of the PPVT-III with 46 M&#257;ori children from three different age groups. Results revealed that the PPVT-III appeared to be suitable for use with M&#257;ori, although a number of suggestions were made as to ways in which the administration and interpretation of PPVT-III test scores could be adjusted when working with M&#257;ori. Additional research is required to establish whether changes to culturally biased items may improve the validity of the PPVT-III for use with M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychometric Assessment; M&#257;ori children; PPVT-III</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogeology of the Hinds Rangitata Plain,  and the Impacts of the Mayfield-Hinds  Irrigation Scheme</field><field name="creator">Dommisse, James</field><field name="description">The main aim of this research was to gain a better understanding of the surface and groundwater  systems in order to sustainably manage the resource for both current and future generations.  Three aquifers are present within the Hinds Rangitata Plain. Aquifer one extends from near  surface to approximately 40 - 50 m, aquifer two occurs from approximately 40 - 90 m, and  aquifer three occurs from approximately 90 - 150 m. Aquifer one is shown to occur as a series  of permeable, iron stained, poorly connected and laterally discontinuous lenses, within and often  separated by less permeable sandy or tight claybound gravels. Lenses range from a few  centimeters to 20 m wide and from a few centimeters to 1 m thick. These permeable layers are  known to be the dominant sources of groundwater from aquifer one.  In all three aquifers depth to groundwater and water seasonal water level fluctuations increase  with increasing distance inland from the coast. Aquifer one gains and loses groundwater along  different sections of the Hinds and Rangitata Rivers.  The Hinds Rangitata Plain can be broken into seven distinct zones based on differences in the  dominant source (s) of groundwater recharge within each zone. The boundaries for each zone  were determined by comparing the short-term seasonal water level fluctuations observed over the  course of this study and the long-term water level records, with rainfall, river flows and  Mayfield-Hinds Scheme recharge. The majority of the zones also have distinctly different  groundwater chemistry and oxygen-18 (d18O) values.  Flows in drains and the Hinds River were highly influenced by groundwater levels. Drains and  springs within the Mayfield-Hinds Irrigation Scheme were highly influenced by irrigation  recharge where as those closer to the coast were more influenced by rainfall.  A regional water balance of the Hinds Rangitata Plain was carried out for a one period, between  September 2005 and August 2006. During this period, total recharge was 375 m3 x 106, total  discharge was 227 m3 x 106, and the outflow was 148 m3 x 106. Data collected during the course  of this study showed that rainfall recharge was dominant, accounting for 67 % of the total  recharge. The Mayfield-Hinds Irrigation Scheme accounted for 30 % of the total recharge, with  a relatively small contribution each from the Rangitata Diversion Race and Hinds River. In  terms of discharge, the combined discharge from the drains and Rangitata River terrace springs,  accounted for 62 % of the total discharge, with the remaining discharge from coming from  groundwater abstraction. There are no overall losses to groundwater from either the Rangitata  River or from stockwater race.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rangitata River</field><field name="subject">Hinds River</field><field name="subject">Hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">Mayfield-Hinds Irrigation Scheme</field><field name="subject">Irrigation Scheme</field><field name="subject">Border-dyke</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">Hinds Drains</field><field name="subject">Groundwater Quality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does the language of children born less than 28-weeks gestation differ from language-age matched pairs?</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Mary E</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, approximately 10% of births are considered premature, that is less than 37 weeks gestation. With advances in medical technology, young infants are surviving gestation periods as few as 23 weeks. It is expected that many of these severely premature infants will demonstrate some problem in their academic, or cognitive function including language functioning. It is agreed that children who are born severely premature often present with language problems, the nature of the difficulties are not clear. Research examining language abilities that involve cognitive functions such as inference generation have demonstrated that children born prematurely exhibit difficulties with phonologic short-term memory and executive function. Language tasks such as inference understanding require children to integrate real-world knowledge with the linguistic information to generate and produce language that is more complex.  The aim of this study was to discover if the language of children born severely premature differs from that of language-age matched peers. This study examined high-level language abilities of school-age children born severely prematurely, specifically, language tasks that involved executive functions including working memory, story inferencing, and recognising absurdities.  Six children who were born less than 28 weeks gestation participated in this study. Their results on the above measures were compared to a language-aged matched comparison group, determined by performance on a standardised test. It was hypothesised that the children born severely premature would not differ from their language-age matched peers on measures of general language ability but differences would exist on measures of language processing and inferencing. The findings overall  showed little difference between the preterm group and their language-age matched peers on measures except for the measure of chronological age. Although no group difference was found for the measure of working memory, a larger variance on this measure was observed in the preterm group.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language outcomes</field><field name="subject">severe prematurity</field><field name="subject">executive function</field><field name="subject">inferencing abilities</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiation Dosimetry  of  Irregularly Shaped Objects</field><field name="creator">Griffin, Jonathan Alexander</field><field name="description">Electron beam therapy planning and custom electron bolus design were identified  as areas in which improvements in equipment and techniques could  lead to significant improvements in treatment delivery and patient outcomes.  The electron pencil beam algorithms used in conventional Treatment  Planning Systems do not accurately model the dose distribution in irregularly  shaped objects, near oblique surfaces or in inhomogeneous media. For  this reason, at Christchurch Oncology Centre the TPS is not relied on for  planning electron beam treatments.  This project is an initial study of ways to improve the design of custom  electron bolus, the planning of electron beam therapy, and other radiation  therapy simulation tasks, by developing a system for the accurate assessment  of dose distributions under irregular contours in clinically relevant situations.  A shaped water phantom system and a diode array have been developed  and tested. The design and construction of this water phantom dosimetry  system are described, and its capabilities and limitations discussed.  An EGS/BEAM Monte Carlo simulation system has been installed, and  models of the Christchurch Oncology Centre linacs in 6MeV and 9MeV  electron beam modes have been built and commissioned.  A test was run comparing the EGS/BEAM Monte Carlo system and the  CMS Xio conventional treatment planning system with the experimental  measurement technique using the water phantom and the diode array. This  test was successful as a proof of the concept of the experimental technique.  At the conclusion of this project, the main limitation of the diode array  system was the lack of data processing software. The array produces a large  volume of raw data, but not enough processed data was produced during  this project to match the spatial resolution of the computer models. An  automated data processing system will be needed for clinical use of the  array.  It has been confirmed that Monte Carlo and pencil-beam algorithms  predict significantly different dose distributions for an irregularly shaped  object irradiated with megavoltage electron beams. The results from the  diode array were consistent with the theoretical models.  This project was an initial investigation. At the time of writing, the  diode array and the water phantom systems were still at an early stage of  development. The work reported here was performed to build, test and    commission the equipment. Additional work will be needed to produce an  instrument for clinical use. Research into electron beam therapy could be  continued, or the equipment used to expand research into new areas.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical physics</field><field name="subject">radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">treatment planning</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo simulation</field><field name="subject">radiation dosimetry</field><field name="subject">electron beam therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is working memory load a critical factor in distractor processing?</field><field name="creator">Davis, Marion Denise</field><field name="description">To achieve goal-orientated behaviour, selective attention is often needed to filter out irrelevant information. Past research has shown that working memory (WM) plays a critical role in selective attention, with high WM load leading to more distractor interference than low WM load. However, because WM load is usually manipulated by requiring participants to hold in memory either one or several digits that were presented simultaneously while performing a selective attention task, the extent of attentional focus was not controlled. The present study examined the effect of WM load on distractor inhibition while keeping attentional focus constant by presenting one digit (low load condition) or six digits (high load condition) sequentially. The participants in the high-load condition demonstrated greater distractor interference than the participants in the low-load condition, suggesting that WM load influences distractor inhibition even when the extent of attentional focus was controlled. This result provides converging evidence to Lavie's (1995, 2005) load theory of attention and cognitive control.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">working memory load</field><field name="subject">inhibition</field><field name="subject">distractors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Varying Field Size Translational Bed Technique for Total Body Irradiation.</field><field name="creator">Wilder, Ben Richard</field><field name="description">Total body irradiation is the irradiation of the entire patient as a conditioning for bone marrow transplants. The conditioning process involves destroying the bone marrow allowing for repopulation of the donor bone marrow cells, suppression of the immune system to allow stop graft rejection, and to eliminate the cancer cell population within the patient. Studies have been done demonstrating the importance of TBI conditioning for BMT5. A range of TBI treatment techniques exist, this department uses a bi-lateral technique which requires bolus packed around the patient to simplify the geometry of the treatment. This investigation will focus on one technique which involves using a translating bed. This technique effectively scans a radiation beam over the patient as the bed moves through the beam. Other investigations on translating beds concentrated on varying the scan speed to achieve a dose uniformity to within &#177;5%. The recommendations quote a dose uniformity of +5% and -10% as acceptable&#8313;. The dose uniformity in these investigations was along the midline in the longitudinal direction only. This investigation varied field size to achieve dose uniformity to within &#177;2.5% along the midline of an anthropomorphic phantom. The goal was to determine if a dynamic multi-leaf collimator could be used to give a uniform in the transverse direction as well as the longitudinal direction. An advantage of utilizing the DMLC for this treatment is the ability to shield organs at risk, i.e. lungs and kidneys, without requiring resources to produce shielding blocks14. Gafchromic-EBT film18 was used as a dosimeter but gave unreliable results due to the lack of film scanning equipment with an appropriate sensitivity for reading the dose to the film. Scans were simulated using Xio treatment planning software. The results from the simulations gave a more reliable indication of the absorbed dose to the midline of the phantom. The disadvantage of this varying field size technique was the time and complexity involved in creating a treatment plan. Within the Xio software exists a limit on the number of beams allowed to be applied in a single plan. There is a maximum of 99 beams allowed which is not enough for complete coverage of a patient. A way around this is to increase the field sizes and decrease the scan speed. This option was not investigated. The advantage of this technique was the increased dose uniformity (&#177;2.5%) in comparison to the varying scan speed techniques (&#177;5%). This technique also allows the patient to be unencumbered during the treatment making the process more comfortable for them.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Varying couch technique</field><field name="subject">varying bed technique</field><field name="subject">translational techinque</field><field name="subject">scanning beam</field><field name="subject">Total Body Irradiation</field><field name="subject">TBI</field><field name="subject">radiation therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental impact assessment : current problems in Australia and prospects for improvement</field><field name="creator">Morris, Mary Lou.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves [i]-vi.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Environmental impact analysis Australia</field><field name="subject">Environmental policy Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ENV/09envm877.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:8414043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, synthesis and testing of calpain inhibitors for the treatment of cataract</field><field name="creator">Chen, Hongyuan</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the development of potent and selective inhibitors of m-calpain for the treatment of cataract.

Group Special  Education, Early Intervention (GSE/EI) (2005) adapted the Canterbury Behaviour  Screening Protocol (CBSP) from a widely used behaviour-screening instrument the  Early Screening Project.  The CBSP consisted of 49 items in 2 checklists. GSE/EI identified 10 early  childhood centres with a total roll of 712 to participate in the study. Staff were asked to  categorise children's problem behaviours as either withdrawn/isolated or  aggressive/oppositional, using profiles provided. Next, they were asked to nominate 2  children in each category, and an additional 2 children in either category, and to rank  them from most concerning to least concerning. Centres identified 25 children in the  withdrawn/isolated category, and 28 children in the aggressive/oppositional category.  Staff completed checklists for children with parent/carer consent, which were scored  according to preset protocols. Scores on the CBSP were assigned risk values ranging  from "extreme" to "no risk". The estimated prevalence of "high" to "extreme" behaviour  problems was 7.2% based on CBSP protocols and teacher nominations. The level of  agreement between teacher rank and CBSP score was 79%, and this determined the initial  specificity.  Next, independent observations of the behaviour of the nominated children were  conducted during free play periods at the centres by an observer blind to the children's  nominated category, teacher ranking or checklist score. Risk levels were assigned based on the observation scores, using a cut-off value of 37% time spent in problem behaviour  for girls and 40% for boys. There was agreement in terms of teacher rank and observation  scores, (categorised into either "no risk" and "at/high/extreme risk) for 65% for children  in the withdrawn/isolated category, and 75% for children in the aggressive/oppositional  category. The level of agreement between the CBSP score and the observations  (categorised into either "no risk" or "at/high/extreme" risk) was 40% for children in the  withdrawn/isolated category, and 46% for children in the aggressive/oppositional  category.  Using the cut-off values, a prevalence estimate for high risk or extreme risk for  behaviour disorders, based on independent observation of children, was 3.2%.  Centre staff completing a feedback form determined the social validity of the CBSP.  Although responses were generally favourable, a number of suggestions were also made  to improve the procedure.  Despite limitations in the design of the draft, the CBSP shows promise for a first  step in a screening procedure designed to screen New Zealand early childhood centres for  children who may be at risk for developing behaviour and/or social emotional problems.  The independent observation may also be useful as a second step, prior to extensive  eligibility assessment. A number of suggestions were made for future drafts such as  addressing the limitations specified, conducting the CBSP with a greater number of  children, and determining the concurrent validity, and test-retest reliability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Validity</field><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Screening</field><field name="subject">Pilot Study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The validity of a three-part criteria for differentiating between delayed pharyngeal swallow and premature spillage secondary to poor oro-lingual control on videofluoroscopy</field><field name="creator">Flanagan, Liana</field><field name="description">Background and Aims  The accurate differentiation between a delayed pharyngeal swallow (sensory impairment) and premature spillage secondary to poor oro-lingual control (motor impairment) is essential to effective dysphagia management. However both physiologic abnormalities result in an identical radiographic sign, that of pre-swallow pooling of the bolus in the pharynx. The dysphagia literature does not provide satisfactory guidelines for making this distinction on videofluoroscopy. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of a three-part rating scale for differentiating between these two impairments.  Methods  Videofluoroscopy was used to evaluate the swallowing of 29 participants presenting with dysphagia following stroke. Sensory thresholds for these participants were established by electrical stimulation of the anterior faucial pillars. The videofluoroscopic swallowing studies were analysed using the three-part rating scale and results from this were compared to sensory thresholds using Pearson's product moment correlation.  Results  There was no significant correlation between the three-part criteria and sensory thresholds. Inter-rater reliability for some measures was poor.      Conclusions  The three-part criteria was not shown to be a valid measure for differentiating between delayed pharyngeal swallow and premature spillage secondary to poor oro-lingual control. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed, including the relevance of faucial pillar sensation to swallowing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delayed pharyngeal swallow</field><field name="subject">pre-swallow pooling secondary to poor oro-lingual control</field><field name="subject">videofluoroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural displays, acoustic and  chemosensory communication in the  Middle Island tusked weta,  Motuweta isolata  (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae)</field><field name="creator">Guignion, Cassandra Ann</field><field name="description">Three methods of communication were examined in the Middle Island tusked  weta, Motuweta isolata (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae); defence behaviour,  acoustic and chemosensory signalling. Previous studies had been limited to basic  autecology and anecdotal evidence. This study was undertaken to understand  the behaviours of this species to assist in conservation efforts.  Defensive behaviours were elicited through repeated stimulation while aggressive  behaviours were acquired through male-male battles. Femoro-abdominal  stridulation was induced within both situations. Defensive stridulation functioned  as alarm behaviour and was often accompanied by a visual display. Agonistic  stridulation was executed by the eventual winner of combat. Aggressive  battles were a progression of behavioural units of increasing risk on injury until  an individual was determined the winner.  Acoustic analysis was preformed on stridulations observed in aggressive and  defensive behaviours. Stridulation was a broad band signal covering a range well  above 16 kHz and possibly into the ultrasound range (&gt;20 kHz). Two different  forms of stridulation were identified; click train sound and hiss sound. High speed  frame-by-frame analysis of stridulation and scanning electron micrographs of the  abdomen and medial femur deciphered the mechanism and found the interaction  of the cuticle to be unique among weta. Strikingly, micrographs also revealed  two morphologies of abdominal projections; truncated ridges and columnar pegs.  Both these points were not previously observed.  Y-maze and partition tests were utilized for evidence of chemosensory signalling,  while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified faecal volatiles  in M. iisolata and 4 other weta species in a parallel study. Through partition  experiments, evidence exists for a species-specific volatile pheromone and a sex-specific chemo-tactile pheromone. Dimethylsulphide, (CH3)2S, was present in the  faeces of all 5 weta species, and may be produced by the individual.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">weta</field><field name="subject">Motuweta isolata (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae)</field><field name="subject">defence behaviour</field><field name="subject">acoustic signalling</field><field name="subject">chemosensory signalling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Self-Management of Type 2 Diabetes:  changing exercise behaviours  for better health</field><field name="creator">Brinson, David Raymond</field><field name="description">New Zealand is currently in the midst of a diabetes epidemic and it has become clear that the increasing  prevalence of obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are inextricably linked to this escalating health crisis.  Extensive research has long made clear that people of all ages can enhance their health by incorporating  moderate levels of physical activity as part of their normal daily routine and physical activity is now  recognised as a major therapeutic modality for type 2 diabetes. Despite such evidence, most people in the  western world do not engage in sufficient regular physical activity and there remains a paucity of  evidence that elucidates effective methods of achieving the required behaviour change over time. This  study set out to demonstrate meaningful correlations between the psychosocial constructs optimism,  exercise self-efficacy, goal-directness, stage of change, anxiety and depression, the biochemical  measures HbA1c and BMI and also the behavioural outcomes of general physical activity and physical  exercise participation, all within a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic population.  Participants (n=30, newly diagnosed adults with type 2 diabetes; mean age 61.46 years; BMI 31.43  Kg/m&#195;&#8218;&#194;&#178;[range 18.8-50.95 Kg/m&#195;&#8218;&#194;&#178;]) were recruited from attendees of the Christchurch Diabetes Centre's  education seminars. The recruitment strategy was designed to search out diabetic patients as near as  practicable to the point in time when they first became cognisant of their disease state. A battery of  instruments was assembled into a researcher-administered retrospective questionnaire and this was  completed with all subjects at baseline and again at six month follow-up. Additional data comprised  subject's demographics and selected bio-chemical measures (subject height, weight, and blood  Haemoglobin A1c). Descriptive, correlational and qualitative statistics were evaluated.  The level of physical activity reported was significantly less than is required to facilitate the biochemical  and psychological changes that are generally considered necessary to support optimal health. On  average, study participants did not perform their planned physical activity tasks as well as they might  have, despite being relatively optimistic and goal-directed at baseline. Many participants clearly  indicated an inadequate understanding of exercise modalities and the intensity, duration and frequency of  physical activity required to support optimal health. Generally, participants tended to overestimate their  physical activity levels. Exercise self-efficacy emerged as an especially important psychological  construct, and one that appeared to be among those central to the participants' relationships with physical  activity and exercise. The study group demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of low level anxiety and  depression, and even at these sub-clinical levels, anxiety and depression were significantly inversely  related to optimism, goal-directness, goal-attainment, exercise self-efficacy and stage of change.  The study findings illuminate the wide contextual variability among patients who are suffering from the  same chronic condition. Further, the implications of conducting detailed pre-assessments of patients'  personal characteristics and their psychological profiles, in order to guide intervention tailoring, are also  outlined and discussed. Areas for future research are highlighted. In conclusion, meso and macro-level  policy implications are discussed, with reference to an array of the broader determinants of health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">self-management</field><field name="subject">lifestyle</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Coupling of Dynamics and Chemistry in the Antarctic Stratosphere</field><field name="creator">Huck, Petra Ellen</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the parameterisation of chemical and dynamical processes in the Antarctic stratosphere. Statistical models for the inter- and intra-annual variability in Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion were developed based on theory and an understanding of the coupling of dynamics and chemistry in the  atmosphere.     It was confirmed that the primary driver of the long-term trend in the severity of the Antarctic ozone hole is halogen loading in the stratosphere. The year-to-year variability in ozone mass deficit, a measure of the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion, could be described by a linear combination of South Pole temperatures  and midlatitude wave activity. A time lag of two weeks between wave activity effects and ozone depletion indicates the predictive capability of meteorological parameters for seasonal projections of the severity of the Antarctic ozone hole. The statistical model describing the inter-annual variability in ozone mass deficit  was regressed against observations from 1979 to 2004. The resulting regression coefficients were applied to South Pole temperature and wave activity fields from 28 chemistry-climate models. This analysis indicates a slight increase in the year-to-year variability in the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion.    As a prelude to analysing the seasonal evolution of Antarctic ozone depletion, an improved ozone mass deficit measure was derived by replacing the constant 220 DU threshold with a seasonal varying pre-ozone hole background which leads to better capturing the true extent of the depleted ozone. Furthermore, it was shown that the new measure represents the chemical ozone loss within the Antarctic vortex provided that no mixing occurs through the vortex boundary. This new measure has many advantages over previous stratospheric ozone depletion indices. The conventional ozone mass deficit omits large amounts of depleted mass  of ozone, and the onset of ozone depletion does not coincide with the timing of when sunlight first reaches areas of polar stratospheric clouds as expected from theory. Chemical ozone loss derived with a tracer-tracer correlation technique  depends on ozone and passive tracer profile measurements which are not as readily  available as the total column ozone fields required for the new ozone mass deficit  presented in this thesis. As such, the new ozone depletion measure combines the simplicity of the old ozone mass deficit index with higher accuracy of the actual amount of chemically depleted stratospheric ozone. Furthermore, when applying  the new definition of ozone mass deficit to chemistry-climate model outputs, model intercomparisons should become easier to interpret because biases in the models can be avoided.    Based on theory and understanding of the coupling of chemistry and dynamics in the Antarctic stratosphere, two semi-empirical models were developed to describe the intra-seasonal evolution of chlorine activation and ozone depletion. Regression of the models against chlorine monoxide and ozone mass deficit from observations results in coefficients that capture key sensitivities in the real atmosphere. The  seasonal evolution of ozone mass deficit can be described with these coefficients and readily available meteorological fields (temperature and wind fields). The predictive capability of these models was demonstrated for 2005 and 2006. Given  temperature and wind fields, which for example can be obtained from general circulation models, these models can predict the size and depth of the Antarctic ozone hole. Important applications of the semi-empirical models could be chemistry-climate model validation by comparing the sensitivities from observations and models which may provide new insights into potential sources of  differences in chemistry-climate model projections of Antarctic ozone depletion.  Furthermore, projection of the inter-annual and intra-seasonal evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole into the future can help to assess the potential recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctic stratosphere</field><field name="subject">ozone depletion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acoustic signals as visual biofeedback in the speech training of hearing impaired children</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study investigated the effectiveness of utilizing acoustic measures as an  objective tool in monitoring speech errors and providing visual feedback to enhance  speech training and aural rehabilitation of children with hearing impairment. The first  part of the study included a comprehensive description of the acoustic characteristics  related to the speech deficits of a hearing impaired child. Results of a series of t-tests  performed on the experimental measures showed that vowel length and the loci of  formant frequencies were most relevant in differentiating between correctly and  incorrectly produced vowels, while voice onset time along with measures of Moment 1  (mean) and Moment 3 (skewness) obtained from speech moment analysis, were related  to consonant accuracy. These findings, especially the finding of an abnormal sound  frequency distribution shown in the hearing impaired child's consonant production,  suggest a link between perceptual deficits and speech production errors and provide  clues to the type of compensatory feedback needed for aural rehabilitation.  The second part of the study involved a multiple baseline design across  behaviours with replication across three hearing impaired children to assess the efficacy  of treatment with acoustic signals as visual feedback. Participants' speech articulations  following traditional speech training and training using spectrographic and RMS  displays as visual feedback (referred to as 'visual treatment') were compared, with  traditional non-visual treatment followed by visual treatment on one or two targets in a  time-staggered fashion. Although no statistically significant difference on the  experimental measures was found between the two training approaches based on  perceptual assessment, some objective acoustic measures revealed more subtle changes  toward normal speech patterns with visual treatment as compared to a traditional  approach. Further acoustic-perceptual studies with a larger sample size and longer  experimental period are needed to better understand the general and long-term  effectiveness of visual treatment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustic measures</field><field name="subject">speech errors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of disfluency clusters in adults who stutter</field><field name="creator">Sargent, Ainsley</field><field name="description">The phenomena of disfluency clusters have been examined in the speech of children who stutter (CWS) and children who do not stutter (CWNS).

The likely cause has been attributed to structural or functional abnormalities of the velopharyngeal mechanism as well as deviations in pitch and loudness. In addition, hearing impaired individuals speak at a slower rate than normal hearing individuals which has been shown to exacerbate the presence of nasality in their speech (Colton &amp; Cooker, 1968). The purpose of this study was to determine whether deliberate increases in speaking rate would serve to decrease the amount of nasality in the speech of severely hearing impaired individuals. The participants were 11 severe to profoundly hearing impaired students, ranging in age from 12 to 19 years (mean = 16 years). Each participant provided a baseline speech sample (R1) followed by three training sessions during which participants were trained to increase their speaking rate. Following the training sessions, a second speech sample was obtained (R2). Acoustic and perceptual analysis pf the speech samples obtained at R1 and R2 were undertaken. The acoustic analysis focused on changes in first and second formant frequency bandwidth (BW1 &amp; BW2). The perceptual analysis involved 21 na&#239;ve listeners rating the speech samples (at R1 &amp; R2) for perceived nasality. Findings indicated a significant increase in speaking rate at R2. In addition, a significantly narrower BW2 frequency and lower perceptual rating score was obtained at R2 across all participants, suggesting a considerable decrease in nasality as speaking rate increases. The influences of speaking rate changes on the functioning of the velopharyngeal mechanism are discussed. In addition, the clinical implications of the findings are explored.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustics</field><field name="subject">deafness</field><field name="subject">nasality</field><field name="subject">speaking rate</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Process of Motivational Enhancement Therapy: Relationships between Therapist and Client Behaviours, and Alcohol Use Outcome</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Samadhi Deva</field><field name="description">Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based, directive, client-centered therapy designed to develop discrepancy and resolve ambivalence by eliciting and reinforcing client Change Talk. However, the exact link between the process engaged in during MI and outcome is only starting to be uncovered.   The present thesis has replicated and expanded on the current knowledge of the relationship between Therapist and Client Behaviours during a MI-based intervention (Motivational Enhancement Therapy; MET) and outcome, and has provided support for the emergent theory of the inner workings of MI. This was achieved by coding 106 audiotaped MET sessions primarily by the methods outlined in the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code Version 2.0. Data was drawn from 28 participants who received 3-4 sessions of MET within the context of a randomised controlled trial for mild-moderate alcohol dependence at the Community Alcohol and Drug Service of Christchurch. Therapist and Client Behaviours were analysed within sessions (categorised into Early, Mid, or End Intervals) and across sessions, and compared with whether the client had drank within national drinking guidelines during the 6-months after MET (Controlled Drinkers).  In terms of Client Behaviours during MET it was found that Uncontrolled Drinkers (compared with Controlled Drinkers) uttered a significantly higher frequency of Sustain Talk, lower Ability Language strength (over all MET and during End Intervals), and lower Commitment Language strength (during Session 2 and 4, and change over MET). Giving Information was the only Therapist Behaviour where significant differences were observed over all MET, with a higher frequency given to the Uncontrolled Drinkers. However, during End Intervals within MET Sessions, Controlled Drinkers received a significantly higher frequency of Advise without Permission and a lower frequency of Emphasise Control statements. In most instances MI-Consistent Therapist Behaviours were associated with higher strength of Ability and Commitment Language, and a lower frequency of Sustain Talk. MI-Inconsistent Therapist Behaviour, Direct, was associated with lower Client Language strength. Limitations to these results include small sample, limited ability to make inferences about causality, coder biases, and uneven reliability. However, this exploratory study was unique in investigating the relationship between Therapist Behaviours and the strength of Client Language, and in examining these factors within and across multiple sessions, and has produced a number of potentially valuable findings that warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivational Interviewing</field><field name="subject">Motivational Enhancement Therapy</field><field name="subject">Process</field><field name="subject">MISC</field><field name="subject">Mechanism of change</field><field name="subject">alcohol treatment outcome</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of stream productivity on aquatic-terrestrial linkages</field><field name="creator">Burdon, Francis John</field><field name="description">The potential relationship between riparian arachnids and aquatic insect productivity was assessed in forest streams throughout the central South Island of New Zealand. Initially, a survey was conducted of thirty seven, first-third order forest streams. Streams were selected to represent a range of benthic invertebrate standing crops (as a surrogate measure of "productivity") from Banks Peninsula streams with relatively high benthic invertebrate densities to acid mine drainage streams near Reefton that were almost devoid of aquatic life. At each site benthic invertebrate densities and biomass were measured in riffle habitats and adjacent gravel bars were sampled for terrestrial invertebrates. At a sub-set of 16 sites, a 20 metre longitudinal web-building spider survey was conducted along each bank of the stream. As an additional component, a 20 metre transect starting at the stream margin and running perpendicularly into the forest was used to survey the density of web-building spiders with increasing distance from the stream.      Results from the survey of in-situ stream insect biomass and gravel bar invertebrates showed a strong relationship between aquatic insect biomass and the biomass of riparian arachnids (R2 = 0.42, P &lt; 0.001) having accounted for potentially confounding factors such as stream size, elevation, substrate and disturbance. The 20 metre longitudinal survey showed that streams with the highest in-situ insect biomass had significantly higher densities of web-building spiders along their banks (R2 = 0.28, P &lt; 0.05), having accounted for potential confounding variables of elevation, habitat architecture and stream and channel width. The stream to forest survey showed a strong exponential decay in web-building spider densities with increasing distance from the stream (R2 = 0.96, P &lt; 0.0001). Regardless of stream productivity web-building spiders were most abundant at the stream margins and rapidly declined to very low densities 20 metres from the stream.      In order to further test the relationship between riparian web-building spider densities and stream insect productivity, a stream fertilization experiment was conducted on six first-second order streams in the Maimai experimental catchment, Reefton. Three streams were enriched by the addition of a fertiliser solution mainly consisting of sodium nitrate for seven months, and the other three streams were used as controls. Water chemistry, benthic invertebrate communities, emerging aquatic adults, and the densities of web-building spiders along the stream corridor and in the forest were monitored in three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) over the course of the nutrient-addition.      By the end of the experiment, conductivity was significantly higher in nutrient-addition streams than in the control streams (F = 80.5, P &lt; 0.001), but chlorophyll concentrations showed no significant differences between treatments. Both benthic mayfly densities (F = 6.15, P &lt; 0.05) and the biomass of adult aquatic dipterans (Chironomidae, Simuliidae) (F = 9.25, P &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in nutrient-addition streams in the last sampling round. Spiders recorded from intercept traps indicated that by the end of the experiment spider activity was significantly higher within 2.5 metres of the nutrient-addition streams (F = 5.70, P &lt; 0.01). However, seasonal densities of web-building spiders along the stream margin and in the forest decreased with no significant differences observed between nutrient-addition and control streams.      The results from these studies indicate that adult insects emerging from streams represent an important source of prey that could influence the biomass and abundance of riparian arachnids. Additionally, the results imply that stream productivity and size could mediate the strength of the interaction between riparian and stream habitats. Moreover, feedback mechanisms present in both systems could have implications for such interactions. The elevated densities of web-building spiders observed at the stream margin led to the proposal of the "Highway Robber" hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that such higher densities of spiders are the result of increased insect activity along the stream corridor: the emergence of adult aquatic insects was predicted to vary less over temporal and spatial scales than that of terrestrial insects due to the poorly synchronized life histories in many New Zealand stream insects. I conclude by suggesting that there are numerous anthropocentric perturbations such as loss of heterogeneity, introduced species, pollution and habitat degradation that could undermine and decouple the intimate linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">streams</field><field name="subject">benthic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">aquatic insects</field><field name="subject">spiders</field><field name="subject">arachnids</field><field name="subject">riparian communities</field><field name="subject">food-webs</field><field name="subject">aquatic-terrestrial linkages</field><field name="subject">spatial subsidies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fate and effects of sewage-derived pharmaceuticals in soil</field><field name="creator">Gielen, Gertruda Jacqueline Hariette Petronella</field><field name="description">The behaviour and impact of pharmaceuticals in the environment are still poorly understood. Pharmaceuticals are widely used and continually released into the environment causing increasing concerns about their impact on the environment beyond the intended human or veterinary use. Prescribed pharmaceuticals, typically, enter the environment either through excretion after human use or disposal of surplus medication. Sewage treatment plants do not completely remove pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and these have been detected in sewage treatment plant effluent and receiving waters. Land application of treated sewage effluent is widely practiced in New Zealand as an alternative to surface water discharge. Methods were developed to determine selected pharmaceuticals in environmental matrices such as sewage effluent, sewage solids, soil, and soil water. From these, pharmaceutical removal efficiencies were determined for three common sewage treatment processes; activated sludge, composting and land application of sewage effluent. The impacts of some common pharmaceuticals on soil microbial communities, together with the effect of prolonged exposure to sewage effluent on these communities were examined. Additionally, toxicity of sewage effluent, and toxicity mechanisms of specific pharmaceuticals were investigated using luminescent micro-organisms and lettuce seedlings.    Pharmaceuticals were successfully detected in sewage effluent, sewage solids, compost, soil and soil water. The sewage treatment processes investigated, including land application, were able to remove or reduce pharmaceutical concentrations in sewage. In case of land application, volcanic soils were more efficient than sandy soils in pharmaceutical removal while irrigation rate and level of sewage pre-treatment also showed some effect on removal efficiency. Pharmaceuticals were not acutely toxic at environmental levels currently detected. Exposure of microbial communities to unnaturally high levels of pharmaceuticals did demonstrate that most pharmaceuticals were potentially able to induce stress in the microbial community although microbes were able to metabolise some of these pharmaceuticals. Twelve years of effluent irrigation resulted in microbial adaptation to aspirin, acetaminophen and tetracycline, indicating that these pharmaceuticals had an effect on microbial community. Presently, land application of treated sewage waste may be a suitable treatment for additional pharmaceutical removal provided that land application schemes are designed appropriately, and pharmaceutical accumulation in the soil is occasionally monitored. It would be prudent to recognise the potential risk that could be caused by chronic exposure to pharmaceuticals such that continued vigilance may lead to future indications of chronic effects at an early stage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pharmaceuticals</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">soil water</field><field name="subject">microbial community</field><field name="subject">sewage</field><field name="subject">effluent irrigation</field><field name="subject">land application</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">microbial adaptation</field><field name="subject">solid phase extraction</field><field name="subject">supercritical fluid extraction</field><field name="subject">GC-MS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploratory Analysis of Change During Group CBT for Social Phobia in Clinical Practice:  A Treatment-Effectiveness Study.</field><field name="creator">Rudge, Marion</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of a Group CBT programme for Social Phobia was assessed using 18 participants recruited from a routine practice setting.

The idea that a hearing aid user's listening environments are important in prescribing desired hearing aid features has been discussed in the literature, however, investigation of listening environments has been limited in the past as it has relied mainly on subjective recordings. Data logging, the capacity of a hearing aid to continuously store information regarding time spent in different programs, listening environments, and microphone modes, is now available in a number of hearing aid models, and therefore provides an objective tool for studying a hearing aid user's listening environments. The data logging information from fifty-seven new hearing aid wearers, including 50 males and 7 females (mean age = 68 years,   SD = 11.3), was obtained during the first routine clinic follow-up session for each individual. Measures of time spent in different listening environments, microphone modes, and overall sound levels, were analyzed.  Hearing aid usage time was found to be highest in "Speech Only" situations (44.8%), followed by "Quiet" (26.7%), "Noise Only" (16.3%) and "Speech in Noise" (12.3%) situations. The majority of the hearing aid users' time was spent in "Surround" microphone mode (74.3%), followed in order by "Split" (22.3%) and "Full" (3.5%) directional modes. Results of two separate two-way ANOVAs revealed no significant age effect either on time spent in different listening environments [F(3,49) = 0.7, p= 0.5] or on time spent in different microphone modes [F(3,20) = 0.6, p= 0.6]. These findings provide empirical evidence regarding the general listening pattern of hearing aid users, which can be used as a starting point when troubleshooting problems experienced by hearing aid clients, or assessing a user's need for various hearing aid features.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hearing aids</field><field name="subject">listening environments</field><field name="subject">data logging</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of factors affecting the region of origin estimate in bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="creator">Wells, Joanna Kathleen</field><field name="description">The causes of errors in the angle of impact calculation were investigated including the surface type, falling velocity and the method used to fit an ellipse to a bloodstain. As had been cited previously the angle of impact was generally underestimated, especially at acute angles and the reason for this was determined to be due to an overestimation of the length of a bloodstain. The surface type was found to significantly affect the accuracy of an angle of impact calculation and as the falling velocity increased, the angle of impact calculation became more accurate. High-speed photography was used to further investigate the formation of bloodstains on surfaces. It was found that the formation of the bloodstain varied depending on the surface type and the angle of the surface.  Bloodstain pattern analysis involves the application of scientific techniques to reconstruct events that resulted in a bloodstain pattern. The position of the blood source in three-dimensional space is a fundamental element of this application. Currently little is known about the methods used by bloodstain pattern analysts to select bloodstains when determining the region of origin. Fourteen analysts worldwide were surveyed in order to ascertain this information. It was found that the methods used were variable and were often not based on scientific research. Research was therefore undertaken into bloodstain selection and in particular, which bloodstains should be selected for a region of origin analysis. As a result of these experiments, two sets of selection criteria were established, one for use when the region of origin is being calculated manually and one for when directional analysis is being used.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic Science</field><field name="subject">Bloodstain Pattern Analysis</field><field name="subject">BPA</field><field name="subject">Crime Scene Reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Crime Scene Investigation</field><field name="subject">Blood</field><field name="subject">Region of Origin</field><field name="subject">Angle of Impact</field><field name="subject">Impact Spatter</field><field name="subject">Blood Spatter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of timely otolaryngological/audiological intervention on patients with acute vertigo due to peripheral vestibular disorders</field><field name="creator">Gawankar, Sudarshan Vijay</field><field name="description">Vertigo is the presenting symptom of some peripheral vestibular disorders, like Benign Positional Vertigo (BPV), M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease, and vestibular neuritis, and for many other clinical conditions as well. Some clinicians from the Christchurch Public Hospital suspect that there is a significant need to improve the diagnostic accuracy and overall management of patients presenting with complaints of "acute vertigo or dizziness", especially BPV and M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease. The final diagnosis of many such patients treated for these conditions in the past has been suspected to be somewhat incomplete or inappropriate. These patients were commonly referred to various other departments, where they underwent a number of investigations, particularly medical imaging [head CT (Computed Tomography) / MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans, which were in many cases not necessary. Such delays in the process led to an extra or unnecessary burden on the limited health funds available to the hospital or to the patient. Another drawback was an elevated patient stress and anxiety as critical time was lost with the increased number of admissions, or in transferring the patient between various departments without any conclusive diagnosis and treatment. It was proposed to conduct a retrospective study on the accuracy of diagnosis of those patients admitted to Christchurch Public Hospital with complaints of acute vertigo, particularly for suspected peripheral vestibular disorders (mainly BPV and M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease) over the period of 2004-2005. Implementation of a more specific and detailed management approach at the level of the initial clinical examination or diagnostic investigations (specifically, by an early Otolaryngology/Audiology intervention) was planned for the year 2006. The two groups of patients (2004-2005 and 2006) were compared to verify the final achievements concerning the diagnostic accuracy and at various other levels with the newly implemented changes in 2006.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vestibular disorders</field><field name="subject">vertigo</field><field name="subject">balance</field><field name="subject">audiology</field><field name="subject">otolaryngology</field><field name="subject">M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mating strategies and sperm competition in New Zealand geckos (Family Gekkonidae)</field><field name="creator">Todd, Amanda Claire</field><field name="description">Most species of reptile studied to date have polygynandrous mating systems and possess  specialised sperm storage regions. Consequently, there is a high potential for sperm  competition in this group. Using comparative analyses, I examined the level of sperm  competition in New Zealand geckos and how this has influenced the evolution of their  reproductive morphology. Across lizards and snakes, there was more than a 40-fold  variation in relative testis size. New Zealand geckos fell in the middle of this range and  lacked sexual dimorphism in head size, suggesting that most species have  polygynandrous mating systems. I confirmed this for one species, Hoplodactylus  maculatus, which is gregarious, lacks territoriality and has a courtship pattern that  suggests a high level of promiscuity for both sexes. I found that hemipenis size in New  Zealand geckos was positively correlated with relative testis size, suggesting that sperm  competition has resulted in the evolution of larger intromittent organs. However, the  surface features of the hemipenis were relatively conservative across species. Although  there was no relationship between sperm length or putative sperm storage site (SST)  morphology and relative testis size, species with fewer SSTs, and thus more intense  sperm competition, had longer sperm. H. maculatus males produced two types of sperm  which differed not only in length but also in fertilising capacity, the short morph lacking  DNA. This is the first known example of such sperm polymorphism in a vertebrate and  may have evolved in response to sperm competition, the non-fertilising morph potentially helping to block the sperm of rival males or filling sperm storage sites. The motility of these short sperm was positively correlated with temperature; however, at higher  temperatures motility declined with time, suggesting a trade-off between motility and  longevity. Such temperature influences on male reproductive physiology have important  implications for males of ectothermic species under sperm competition.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">N/A</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Hyde-Macraes shear zone in Otago:   A result of continental extension or shortening?  A kinematic analysis of the Footwall Fault</field><field name="creator">Butz, Christoph Florian</field><field name="description">Mineralised shear zones in Otago are often truncated by regional low-angle faults, which juxtapose schist of different metamorphic grade. The Footwall Fault and the Hyde-Macraes Shear Zone are one example for this kind of tectonic setting, and are the subject to this study. Although, the mechanisms for the development of the mineralised thrust-origin shear zones are well studied, the relationship to the truncating faults is still poorly understood. Currently, the truncating low-angle faults are assumed to be related to crustal extension, starting in the early Cretaceous after the schist passed the ductile-brittle transition.   This study presents new kinematic data for the Footwall Fault, suggesting development of normal sense movement under ductile conditions due to an abundant shear band cleavage in the footwall, which dynamically recrystallises quartz grains. However, brittle high-angle normal faults truncating these shear bands indicate either reactivation of normal sense movement after passing the ductile-brittle transition or continuous normal sense movement during the transition.   Furthermore, this study presents a model, which suggests a regional scale rolling hinge development, consisting of an array of individual low-angle normal faults along the boundary of the textural zone change from TZ IV to TZIII, and strike-parallel high-angle faults at the NE margin of the Otago schist.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hyde-Macraes Shear Zone</field><field name="subject">Footwall Fault</field><field name="subject">Otago Schist</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the Dosimetric Effects of Abutting Multi-Leaf-Collimated Photon Fields with Extended Source-to-Surface Electron Fields</field><field name="creator">STEEL, Jared Gary</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the findings of an investigation into the dosimetry resulting from the abutment of en face 6 MeV electron and 6 MV photon beams as applied to the clinical challenge of radiation therapy treatments to head and neck cancer sites. Particular concern is given to the use of multi-leaf collimator (MLC) technology for photon beam definition when abutted to extended source-to-surface (SSD) electron beams. We made dosimetric comparison between MLC and Cerrobend&#174; shielding for use in an abutment situation. The effects of extending the SSD of the electron beam were also assessed. We checked the ability of a Pinnacle3 v7.6 treatment planning system (TPS) to correctly model the dosimetry resulting from this extended electron beam SSD. Volumetric simulations of composite dosimetry resulting in water were conducted in MATLAB&#174; for variations of surface abutment gap, and photon beam shielding type and angle. Visualization Toolkit (VTK) script was developed to visualise the resulting dosimetry. The effect of extending the SSD of the electron beam increases the beam penumbra significantly, exacerbating the challenge of matching this field to a photon beam edge. Furthermore, the TPS was shown to inaccurately model the electron beam penumbra for the extended SSD conditions. The employment of MLC shielding provides for some advantages over Cerrobend&#174; in terms of overall composite hotspot volumes and coldspot magnitudes, though introduces detrimental dosimetric inhomogeneities in the underlying volume. Distinctly, no combination of abutment gap and shielding variables resulted in dosimetry in the range of 90% to 110% at the depth of dmax for the beam energies considered here.

Although it is more than 15 years since these cyclones, they still factor in people's lives and have impacted on the way individuals and organisations conceptualise disasters in Samoa.   The incidence of disasters is increasing globally and Pacific Island nations face ongoing and increasing vulnerability to the impacts of such disasters at both community and national levels. Disasters can result in short and long-term social, economic and environmental consequences and, as Ofa and Val illustrate, entire community survival and livelihood systems can be severely disrupted by a single disaster. As a consequence, disasters continue to pose significant threats to sustainable development in the Pacific region.     Villagers from the eastern coast of Savai'i, and Government and NGO agencies in Apia were interviewed during six weeks of fieldwork in Samoa. These interviews and insights gained from participant observation, as well as secondary materials such as maps and official reports are used to explore the ways in which people make sense of disaster and hazard risk in their daily lives and the ways in which their belief-systems (cultural, religious etc.) result in very different understandings of disasters and disaster risk.    Building on a growing body of critical disaster literature, this thesis explores the ways in which disasters are more than 'natural' events. It examines the ways in which they are socially constructed, resulting from human actions, rather than 'freak natural events'. This approach challenges dominant understandings of disasters which often underpin disaster planning at both national and regional level, and are often characterised by technical 'fixes'. In contrast, this thesis argues for more locally appropriate understandings of 'disasters' and for the importance of placing disaster events within the context of people's everyday lives and broader development priorities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reconceptualising Disasters: Lessons from the Samoan Experience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continental Extensional Tectonics - The Paparoa Metamorphic Core Complex of Westland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Herd, Michelle Erica June</field><field name="description">Cretaceous continental extension was accommodated by the development of the Paparoa Metamorphic Core Complex, resulting in the separation of New Zealand from Gondwana. High grade (Lower Plate) and low grade (Upper Plate) rocks are separated by the Ohika and Pike Detachment Faults. The two detachment faults have distinctly different histories, with greater exhumation along the Pike Detachment Fault. The onset of crustal extension is proposed to have commenced along the Pike Detachment Fault at 116.2 &#177; 5.9 Ma (Rb/Sr dating). Both geochemical and geochronological approaches are adopted for this thesis, through the in situ analysis of oxygen and hafnium isotope ratios, trace metals and U-Pb content. Chemical changes are tracked during the petrogenesis of the Buckland Granite, with mafic replenishment observed in the later stages of crystallisation. Crystallisation temperatures of the Buckland Granite are calculated using zircon saturation thermometry, with an average Ti-in-zircon temperature of 697&#8451; (upper-amphibolite facies). Inherited zircons in Lower Plate rocks show distinct age peaks at c. 1000, 600 and 300 Ma, illustrating the incorporation of heterogeneous local crust (Greenland Group and Karamea Batholith). Model ages (TDM) are calculated for inherited zircons of the Lower Plate rocks, which record the time at which magma bodies (zircon host rocks) were extracted from the mantle. Maximum and minimum model ages for the Buckland Granite average at 3410 Ma and 2969 Ma, with the maximum TDM value of 3410 Ma coinciding with the proposed major crustal formation event of the Gondwana supercontinent at c. 3.4-3.5 Ga. Two distinct U-Pb zircon age peaks are observed in the Buckland Granite at 102.4 &#177; 0.7 and 110.3 &#177; 0.9 Ma. The 110.3 &#177; 0.9 Ma age is interpreted as the crystallisation age of the pluton, while the 102.4 &#177; 0.7 is proposed to represent a younger thermal (magmatic?) event associated with the 101-102 Ma Stitts Tuff.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paparoa</field><field name="subject">metamorphic</field><field name="subject">core complex</field><field name="subject">continental extension</field><field name="subject">tectonics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurements of Human Plasma Oxidation</field><field name="creator">Osborn, Anna</field><field name="description">The oxidation of lipids and antioxidants has been extensively studied in human plasma but little attention has been given to how plasma proteins are oxidised. Proteins make up the majority of biomolecules in cells and plasma and therefore are the most likely reactants with oxidants and free radicals. Previous studies in the laboratory had shown that peroxyl radicals generated by the thermolytic decay of 2-azobis (2-amdinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) generated significant amounts of protein hydroperoxides, but only after a six hour lag period. In this study the existence of the six hour lag period was confirmed and shown by dialysis of the plasma to be due to the presence of low molecular weight antioxidants. The addition of both uric acid and ascorbic acid to the dialysed plasma restored the lag phase suggesting that in vivo these antioxidants act to prevent protein hydroperoxide formation. Lipid oxidation was also observed in the plasma but only after a two hour lag phase. This was the first time lipid oxidation has been observed in the absence of protein oxidation. The lipid lag phase was also abolished by dialysis of the plasma and restored by the addition of ascorbic acid and uric acid. The kinetics of tocopherol loss suggests that the tocopherol radicals act to inhibit lipid oxidation by transferring the electrons to the water-soluble ascorbate. The loss of ascorbate appears to cause the formation of a tocopherol radical mediate the lipid peroxidation process. Overall the data shows ascorbic acid scavenging the peroxyl radicals while uric acid acts to reduce the overall AAPH generated radical flux.  In a separate investigation, the production of protein-bound DOPA (PB-DOPA) on albumin during X-ray radiolysis and copper mediate Fenton oxidation was investigated using a fluorescence based derivatisation method (ED-DOPA), which was compared with the more specific acid hydrolysis and HPLC analysis method. The ED-DOPA method consistently gave a much higher reading that the HPLC based methods, suggesting that the ED-DOPA method was measuring DOPA plus DOPA oxidation products. This was confirmed by oxidising X-ray radiolysis generated PB-DOPA with Cu++ to cause DOPA oxidation. The Cu++ treatment drastically increased the level of signal given by the ED-DOPA assay while HPLC analysis showed all the DOPA had been oxidised.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Free-radical</field><field name="subject">plasma</field><field name="subject">FOX-assay</field><field name="subject">antioxidant</field><field name="subject">protein-oxidation</field><field name="subject">protein-hydroperoxidie</field><field name="subject">lipid-oxidation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of Cascades for the IceCube Neutrino Telescope</field><field name="creator">Hickford, Stephanie Virginia</field><field name="description">Neutrino telescopes open a new observational window on the universe. Neutrino interactions in these detectors can give rise to a combination of electromagnetic cascades, hadronic cascades and long range muons. Cerenkov radiation from these products is detected by the neutrino telescope. In this thesis the observational signatures associated with various neutrino-nucleon interaction products are investigated. Cerenkov radiation is emitted at a distinctive angle, about 40o in ice. The maximum number of optical photons that can be produced per unit charged tracklength is calculated to be 562 photons cm&#8722;1. The simulation programs Pythia and GEANT are used to study neutrino interactions using ice as the medium. The production of tau from the tau neutrino interaction is considered and it is found that the Cerenkov angle from tau is not distinctive at low energies, due to its lifetime tau decays before travelling an observable distance. The energy required for a tau neutrino to produce a sharp tau Cerenkov signal is on the order of 1 PeV. In a high energy electron neutrino interaction the resulting hadronic cascade contains high energy pions and kaons. These particles decay, often producing muons that are also high energy and therefore long range. Due to the muons travelling faster than the local speed of light in ice, their signal may be received by the detector earlier than the signal resulting from the event that created the muon. This can complicate the reconstruction of electron neutrino events.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cascades</field><field name="subject">IceCube</field><field name="subject">Neutrino</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring and modelling of volcanic pollutants from White Island and Ruapehu volcanoes: assessment of related hazard  in the North Island</field><field name="creator">Grunewald, Uwe</field><field name="description">White Island and Ruapehu are currently the most active volcanoes in New Zealand. During non-eruptive periods, intense quiescent degassing through fumaroles can occur. The current project studies the quiescent degassing plumes, including aerosol sampling on White Island and dispersion modelling of SO&#8322; and PM&#8321;&#8320; from White Island and Ruapehu volcanoes. Aerosol sampling from fumaroles at the crater floor on White Island volcano was carried out on 9 February and 6 April 2005. The exposed filters were analysed for various anions and cations and the particle mass concentration and molar concentration determined. Major elemental constituents were sodium and chlorine (Na&#8314;: 413 &#181;g m&#8315;&#179;, Cl&#8315;: 1520 &#181;g m&#8315;&#179;), which show best correlation at both sampling sessions. Other ions detected, with little correlation, are Ca&#178;&#8314;, PO&#8324;&#179;&#8315; and to a certain extent Mg&#178;&#8314;. Other constituents found, which cannot correlate explicitly to other ions, are K&#8314;, NH&#8324;&#8314;, NO&#8323;&#8315;, and SO&#8324;&#178;&#8315;. SEM study of one exposed filter was performed and mainly NaCl particles could be distinguished due to their well-defined cubic shape. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) was used for dispersion modelling of SO&#8322; (models 1-4) and PM&#8321;&#8320; (models 5 and 6) from White Island and Ruapehu volcanoes. Annual modelling was performed using different parameters of emission rate, exit temperature and exit velocity. The resulting plume dispersions show relatively low concentrations at ground level &#8804;10 m), particularly for the models of PM&#8321;&#8320; dispersion. TAPM calculated the highest SO&#8322; ground level concentrations with model 4, where the NES values of 350 and 570 &#181;g m&#8315;&#179; were exceeded several times. The data was then used for detailed hazard assessment of urban population in the North Island. The meteorological data from annual modelling was used for model evaluation and compared with observation data from different weather stations by statistical calculations. Overall, TAPM performed well with most good and very good results. To evaluate SO&#8322; dispersion modelling, airborne plume measurements were carried out on 22 November 2006 by plume traverses at 3, 10 and 20 km. Although there is some variation, the calculated correlation coefficients indicate good model results for two plume traverses at 3 and 20 km and one plume traverse at 10 km. The meteorological data was also used for model evaluation, and the results indicate good model performance. TAPM is therefore suggested for future studies when more observation data are available to verify the calculated model data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pollution modelling</field><field name="subject">TAPM</field><field name="subject">White Island</field><field name="subject">Ruapehu</field><field name="subject">hazard assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the Chemistry of Marine Natural Products</field><field name="creator">Hickford, Sarah Jane Herbison</field><field name="description">Compounds from the marine environment exhibit a wide variety of biological activities, and thus hold much promise as potential drugs.  The halichondrins, isolated from the Kaikoura sponge Lissodendoryx sp. are no exception to this, demonstrating potent anticancer activity.  Novel cytotoxic compounds have also been isolated from the Chatham Rise sponge Lamellomorpha strongylata.  Knowledge of the cellular origins of such compounds is desirable, in order to establish if the sponge or associated micro-organisms are producing the compounds of interest.  Siderophores are also important molecules, which are produced on demand by bacteria in order to obtain sufficient iron necessary for their growth.  Knowledge of the biosynthesis of these compounds has potential for the control of undesirable bacteria, such as the anthrax-causing pathogen Bacillus anthracis.    Cell separation studies have been carried out on Lamellomorpha strongylata, locating a swinholide in sponge-associated filamentous bacteria and theonellapeptolides in sponge-associated unicellular bacteria.  A microscopic analysis of dissociated cells from Lissodendoryx sp. was also undertaken.    The structures of four new halichondrins (3.13 - 3.16), isolated from Lissodendoryx sp., have been determined from spectral data.  All of these compounds are very similar to known B series halichondrins, with differences occurring only beyond carbon 44.  As biological activity has been shown to be derived from the portion of the molecule between carbons 1 and 35, they all retain good activity in the P388 assay as expected.

Three aspects of deforestation were  investigated: the effects of fragmentation and reserve size, the influence of matrix habitat and  the effects offorest edge on frogs in 10- hectare isolates.  Very few frogs species were lost from fragments (regardless of size) following  fragmentation and isolation for 7-10 years. Instead, frog species richness increased, with an  average increase in 10 species per fragment. The increase in species was brought about by an  increase in matrix associated species, some of which were present in the absence of their  preferred breeding habitat.  Different frog species had varied responses to fragmentation. The abundance of  Eleutherodactylus fenestratus, a terrestrial breeder, increased significantly as fragment size  decreased, and its abundance was significantly higher in both large and small fragments than in  continuous forest. Colostethus stepheni, a semi-terrestrial breeder, was less abundant in  fragments than continuous forest. Finally, Eleutherodactylus zimmermanae and Osteocephalus  sp.A did not differ significantly in abundance among fragments, or between fragments and  continuous forest. Multiple regression analysis indicated that variation in litter depth and  canopy cover may explain the observed increase in E. fenestratus abundance in small fragments.  Breeding success of pool breeders attracted to artificial pools was variable, but there was no  evidence of reduced breeding success in fragments relative to primary forest. Overall,  fragmentation appeared to affect the frog community less severely than other taxonomic  groups. Species richness in tropical forest remnants showed a tendency to increase as a result  of fragmentation, and only one of four species exhibited lowered abundance in fragments.  The effects of fragmentation and subsequent small isolated populations of frog species  in fragments was alleviated somewhat by the ability of central Amazonian frogs to utilise matrix  habitat. Litter frogs, wallow breeders and upland forest pool breeders all displayed an ability to  permeate, and in most cases become residents of matrix habitat. Both matrix with a history of  cut and burn and matrix which was only cut supported a similar frog community. Thus, for  central Amazonian frogs isolates were not truly isolated due to the ability of frogs to utilise  matrix habitat.  Litter frogs in 10- hectare isolates displayed an independence from edge related abiotic  and biotic gradients. This independence was true for frog species richness, abundance and  composition. Consequently, forest fragments are in effect larger for frogs than for other taxa  who are constrained by edge effects to exist only within the core of large fragments.  Colostethus stepheni was one species found to be negatively affected by habitat  fragmentation. Abundance of Colostethus stepheni was significantly lower in fragments and  matrix habitat compared to primary continuous forest. This species was also found to be  sensitive to edge, with higher abundances recorded as distance from the edge increased. The  community level approach adopted in this study, as opposed to intensive investigation of single  species, may well have overlooked other' sensitive' species which show more subtle responses  to habitat fragmentation than that of Colostethus stepheni.  The ability to use matrix and the relative independence from edge related phenomena  accounts for the resilience of central Amazonian frogs in a disturbed and fragmented landscape.  However, with respect to matrix habitat, forest surveyed in this study has not been repeatedly  cut or cut and burnt (with the exception of pasture-land where the frog community is  depauperate). In other areas of the Amazon, away from the experimental plots of the BDFFP,  matrix habitat is destroyed more frequently. More work is needed to determine the ability of  central Amazonian frogs to utilise matrix habitat which is disturbed more frequently.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deforestation</field><field name="subject">frogs</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">Amazonian rainforest</field><field name="subject">forest edge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common gecko Hoplodactylus maculatus: an ecophysiological comparsion of two isolated populations</field><field name="creator">Tocher, Mandy Darlene</field><field name="description">Thermophysiological traits of two isolated Hoplodactylus maculatus  populations were investigated to test adpatations to climate. Geckos were  collected from Craigieburn (high altitude, generally cooler site) and Banks  Peninsula. If climatic conditions at respective sites influenced physiology, I  expected geckos from Craigieburn to exhibit cold-adapted physiological traits,  whilst Banks Peninsula geckos would exhibit traits more characteristic of a warmclimate  species. To this end I investigated four thermophysiological parameters:  metabolism (SMR), preferred body temperature (PBT), locomotory performance  and critical thermal minimum (CTMin).  I hypothesized that if climate had an effect on SMR, Craigieburn geckos  would exhibit higher levels of SMR which typically characterise other coolclimate  reptiles. Craigieburn geckos displayed an average relative elevation of  SMR over Banks Peninsula geckos of 26%. Furthermore, Craigieburn geckos  appeared to be 'geared' towards lower body temperatures and exhibited a greater  acclimatory and acclimatizatory ability of SMR.  The PBT of Craigieburn geckos was consistently elevated above Banks  Peninsula geckos. This finding was somewhat paradoxical in light of previous  studies of this parameter. A closer examination of the ecology of the two  populations is required to clarify the adaptive significance of a higher PBT in  geckos from a cooler climate.  With respect to locomotory performance, I hypothesized that if thermal  extremes influenced activity, Craigieburn geckos would exhibit activity patterns  which help ameliorate the adverse effects of cold temperature. Craigieburn  geckos did in fact have greater independence of activity to temperature than  Banks Peninsula geckos, especially over lower body temperatures.  The final parameter investigated, that of the critical thermal minimum, failed  to distinguish the populations decisively. However there was some evidence of  a greater acclimatizatory and acclimatory range in Craigieburn geckos, providing  somewhat limited support for a population difference.  Investigations into all four parameters lead me to conclude that populations  of Hoplodactylus maculatus from Craigieburn and Banks Peninsula are  physiologically distinct and warrant a revision of nomenclature.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Common gecko</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">ecophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of mustelids in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Brian Michael</field><field name="description">Mammalian predators have been liberated on many  islands to control pests but the desired results have  rarely been achieved. The liberation of mongooses on  islands in the Caribbean and Pacific is an excellent  example of a liberation which had serious repercussions.  These were liberated to control rats which caused  serious damage in the sugar cane fields and although  they reduced the numbers of rats, they also exterminated  many species of small mammals and birds.  Stoats, ferrets and weasels were liberated in  New Zealand in the early 1880's to control rabbits. They appear to have had little effect on rabbit  populations and stoats quickly spread into forest areas.  It is not now possible to determine the effect these  predators had on the native bird populations as the changes in fauna and habitat were complex. Unfortunately no studies of mustelids were made until 1948 when Wodzicki (1950) made a brief study as part of his survey  of introduced mammals in New Zealand. The two periods  of greatest change for mustelids have been during  their spread throughout the country in the 1880's and  in the early 1950's when rabbits were successfully  controlled. There is little information on changes  in density or feeding habits of mustelids during these times.  Detailed investigation of the ecology of mustelids in New Zealand was begun by Dr W.H. Marshall,  Fulbright Research Scholar from the University of  Minnesota, with Animal Ecology Division, D.S.l.R. from  September 1960 until June 1961. He examined their ecology  in the light of his experience of mustelids in  North America where conditions differ markedly from  those in New Zealand.  I joined Animal Ecology Division in November 1960  to assist Dr. Marshall throughout the remainder of his  study, and continued the work after his return to the  United States.  The ecology of stoats, ferrets and weasels has been  investigated in terms of their adaptation to food  supplies which differ markedly from those in their native  range in the Northern Hemisphere.</field><field name="date">1964</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stoat</field><field name="subject">ferret</field><field name="subject">weasel</field><field name="subject">Mustelids</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of the Otago Screening Protocol in Identifying School-aged Students with Severe Speech-Language Impairments</field><field name="creator">Musgrave, Jane Ann</field><field name="description">This study examined the effectiveness of the Otago screening protocol in identifying school-aged children with severe speech and language impairments. In order to do so, the results of the Otago screening protocol were compared with those of comprehensive language assessment as determined by best practice protocol (Gillon &amp; Schwarz, 1998, Kennedy, 2002). Following the completion of the screening and the comprehensive assessments, an evaluation of the true positives and false positives was calculated, and an analysis of the false negative outcomes made.     Findings indicated that fourteen of the twenty participants were true positives, three were true negatives, three were false positives, and none were false negatives. The Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value of the screening protocol was 100%. Test Sensitivity and Specificity were very high at 82% and 100%. Inter-rater reliability was very high, generally ranging from 92-100%. Adding a standardised measure of phonological awareness would improve efficiency of the screening protocol. Consideration of alternative screening tools, such as the GAPS test (Gardner et al, 2006) and the CELF-4 screening test (Semel, Secord &amp; Wiig, 2004), should be made. Additional factors which could influence a screening protocol are discussed.

However, the frequencies of SNPs in ND1 and ND2 are not unknown. The present research was aimed to determine the frequencies of SNPs in ND1 and ND2 genes of the mitochondrial genome in fertile and subfertile men and whether changes in codon usage was associated with fertility phenotypes. Total genomic DNA from 157 semen samples was extracted using the proteinase K/SDS digestion procedure, followed by phenol/chloroform purification and ethanol precipitation. ND1 and ND2 genes were amplified respectively from 80 and 92 DNA samples from different fertility groups. Each PCR product was sequenced to identify mutations. Codon change resulting from a nucleotide substitution was determined by comparison with a reference mtDNA sequence obtained from the NCBI database. The frequency of codon usage in the reference mtDNA was determined by the computer program MEGA version 2.1. Eleven synonymous nucleotide substitutions and two non-synonymous substitutions were found in this study. Four SNPs were previously characterized; all SNPs were homoplasmic. None of the SNPs were likely to affect the function of the proteins on the basis of the hydrophobicity plots or secondary structure predictions. Sixty two percent of synonymous mutations were found to change from a high to a low relative codon usage values; 37% of synonymous mutations changed from a low to a high relative usage value. Chi-square (&#967;&#178;) test (&#967;&#178;= 0.067 with 1 d.f.) showed that there was no significant difference at the 5% level between these changes. Thus, change in codon usage was not related to semen quality in men. Further, there were no statistically significant differences in the observed frequencies of SNPs of fertile and subfertile men. However, the sample size was small and this study was only focused on a single NZ Caucasian population. Further study including larger and more diverse population samples may provide further insight into the functional importance of codon usage and its relevance to fertility</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mitochondrion</field><field name="subject">human infertility</field><field name="subject">DNA mutations</field><field name="subject">genetic code</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Explanations In Psychology: A Paradigm For Integrating Psychology With Science</field><field name="creator">Ho, Hui-yu</field><field name="description">Evolutionary psychology has recently developed out of dissatisfaction with the Standard Social Science Model utilised by mainstream psychology. This model focuses on culture and reason as the underlying cause of human behaviour and proposes that the mind is a 'general purpose learning device' (Siegert &amp; Ward, 2002). Here the mind is seen as a blank slate at birth, which is subsequently influenced by experience, environment and culture. Biological variables are minimised or ignored. However it seems that all human behaviour cannot fully be explained by the focus on nurture in the Standard Social Science Model; sexual jealousy, parental investment, and mating preferences are examples which are not fully explained by learning or environmental experience. On the other hand, evolutionary psychology, founded on the principles of cognitive science and evolutionary biology, argues that a person's nature is the primary cause of their behaviour, with the influences of nurture being of lesser importance. According to these principles, evolutionary psychology has been very successful in providing explanations, for example in the areas of human mate selection and parental investment. However evolutionary psychology has received criticism on a number of counts, including its supposed reductionism, and, its reliance on 'just so' stories which are untestable, hypothesised scenarios which look to the past in order to explain the evolution of human behavioural features.   With the above mentioned matters as background, this thesis investigated whether evolutionary psychology offers a new paradigm for integrating psychology with science, and if so, how it accomplishes this. In investigating this, conceptions of science, psychology, and evolutionary theory, in particular evolutionary psychology, were examined. More specifically, issues addresses included why evolutionary psychology is dissatisfied with the SSSM, the notion of the mind as blank slate, the nature-nurture paradigm, and the mind as a general purpose learning device. Two aspects of evolutionary theory are described, natural and sexual selection, in terms of their importance to evolutionary psychology. The main arguments of evolutionary psychology as a discipline are outlined, looking at its aims, and the ways in which it combines the disciplines of evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology toward a new integrative model for studying human behaviour. A case study demonstrates how evolutionary psychology offers a useful explanation of mate selection. This thesis then turns to the philosophy of science, setting out the differences between Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos' theories, and focusing on the latter's theory as a model of scientific philosophy which could be useful for evolutionary psychology, including discussing how this could be best achieved. This thesis then sets out various criticisms of evolutionary psychology, including the critique of domain-specific modularity, the focus on the Pleistocene period as problematic, the over-reliance on natural selection, just-so stories, the reductionism of evolutionary psychology, and that it is politically conservative. This thesis concludes that the attempt of evolutionary psychology to combine cognitive science and evolutionary theory has been successful in showing how the integration of psychology into the sciences is not only possible but inevitable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary psychology</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">philosophy of science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gluon Phenomenology and a Linear Topos</field><field name="creator">Sheppeard, Marni Dee</field><field name="description">In thinking about quantum causality one would like to approach rigorous QFT from outside the perspective of QFT, which one expects to recover only in a specific physical domain of quantum  gravity. This thesis considers issues in causality using Category Theory, and their application to field theoretic observables. It appears that an abstract categorical Machian principle of duality  for a ribbon graph calculus has the potential to incorporate the recent calculation of particle rest masses by Brannen, as well as the Bilson-Thompson characterisation of the particles of the Standard Model.    This thesis shows how Veneziano n point functions may be recovered in such a framework, using cohomological techniques inspired by twistor theory and recent MHV techniques. This distinct approach fits into a rich framework of higher operads, leaving room for a generalisation to other physical amplitudes.    The utility of operads raises the question of a categorical description for the underlying physical logic. We need to consider quantum analogues of a topos. Grothendieck's concept of a topos is a genuine extension of the notion of a space that incorporates a logic internal to itself. Conventional quantum logic has yet to be put into a form of equal utility, although its logic has been formulated in category theoretic terms.    Axioms for a quantum topos are given in this thesis, in terms of braided monoidal categories. The associated logic is analysed and, in particular, elements of linear vector space logic are shown to be recovered. The usefulness of doing so for ordinary quantum computation was made apparent recently by Coecke et al. Vector spaces underly every notion of algebra, and a new perspective on it is therefore useful. The concept of state vector is also readdressed in the language of tricategories.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Category Theory</field><field name="subject">Quantum Gravity</field><field name="subject">Quantum Field Theory</field><field name="subject">Quantum Computation</field><field name="subject">Quantum Logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Teaching and Learning in Introductory Physics</field><field name="creator">Cahyadi, Maria Veronica</field><field name="description">This thesis describes three studies designed to help students learn physics better and instructors teach physics more effectively in local circumstances.     The first study investigated the effects of teaching approaches consisting of interactive engagement activities in two institutions. The teaching elements in the experimental classes were reading quizzes, interactive lecture demonstrations and student discussions. The control classes were taught in traditional style dominated by an instructor lecturing on concepts and problem solving examples. The cognitive improvement was measured by a standardized test and exam grades. The students in the experimental classes showed significant improvement in conceptual understanding and problem solving skills compared to the students in the control classes. While the experimental groups welcomed the modified instruction, they still held the view that the lecturer should play the dominant role of presenting the material.     In the second study interviews with lecturers, teaching assistants and students revealed their perceptions of the utility of real-life materials in instruction. The students asserted that activities using real-life materials were interesting and useful. However, they still considered that elements of traditional instruction were very important in good teaching. The lack of knowledge of innovative teaching approaches may explain why the instructors were sceptical about the effectiveness of real-life materials in improving their students' understanding.     To raise the instructors' awareness of issues in learning physics and to improve their knowledge of effective instruction, the third study discussed a department-based professional development course. The course incorporated interactive engagement activities and made connections to teaching and learning experiences. The course evaluation suggested that the participants became more open to new ideas and intended to implement what they had learned in the present and future academic career.     The studies in this thesis have impacted on first year courses and raised the instructors' awareness of physics education issues. The emphasis of educational enterprises should be shifted from classroom changes to educating the instructors. Instead of simply modifying teaching practice, instructors should also undergo a transformation in beliefs and knowledge in pedagogy. It is only when all instructors are willing to undergo such a transformation that a significant achievement in teaching and learning will be realized.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">introductory physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of trout on galaxiid growth and antipredator behaviour</field><field name="creator">Howard, Simon William</field><field name="description">The introduction of trout has been implicated in the declines in native fish fauna in New Zealand and worldwide. Since the introduction of brown (Salmo trutta) and rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout to New Zealand in 1867, their distribution has spread and they have been implicated in the fragmentation of native fish distributions, particularly native non-migratory galaxiids. However, in the Upper Waimakariri basin the co-occurrence of trout and galaxiid populations is relatively common, even in streams where trout reach sizes known to be piscivorous. To investigate mechanisms that may regulate trout and galaxiid co-occurrence, I investigated differences in antipredator behaviour and growth rate between stream types with varying levels of trout presence. Using quantitative survey data collected between 1997 and 2006, I found that trout abundance was low and varied annually in frequently disturbed sites compared their high abundance in stable streams. This finding was used to classify streams into three population types, barrier (trout absent), disturbed (trout presence intermittent) and sympatric (constant trout presence). Using this classification, I tested the effects of trout chemical cues on galaxiid activity and refuge use in artificial channels. There were no differences in activity or refuge use between trout odour and there were no effects of population type or galaxiid size during both the day and the night. Using otolith weight-fish length relationships in galaxiids collected from each population type, I found that galaxiid growth rate was higher in disturbed streams than in stable streams either with or without trout. An experiment manipulating trout size and presence, over two months in a natural stream, found galaxiids from treatments without trout grew slower than those with trout. Slow growth rates in galaxiids above trout-migration barriers and in sympatry, combined with low growth rates in treatments without trout suggest that the mechanisms that regulate galaxiid growth are more complex than previously thought.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduced species interactions</field><field name="subject">native fish</field><field name="subject">invasive fish</field><field name="subject">Galaxias vulgaris</field><field name="subject">trout</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perspective Taking and Knowledge Attribution in the Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris): A Canine Theory of Mind?</field><field name="creator">Maginnity, Michelle</field><field name="description">Theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, has traditionally been investigated in humans and nonhuman primates. However, non-primate species, such as domestic dogs, may also be potential candidates for such a faculty. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) evolved from a social-living, wolf-like ancestor, and were the first species to be domesticated, with likely selection for sensitivity to human cues and human-like cognitive abilities. Dogs typically spend their lives in the rich social environment of human families, and thus dogs are naturally enculturated. The combination of these factors make dogs an excellent candidate for having a functional theory of mind.     Yet perhaps surprisingly, prior research on theory of mind in dogs is limited, with inconclusive and contradictory results. The research described in this thesis is a systematic investigation of dogs' potential to demonstrate a functional theory of mind in their interactions with humans. Four experiments are presented, based on the Knower-Guesser paradigm (Povinelli et al., 1990), in which a knowledgeable and an ignorant human informant indicated the location of hidden food to the dog.    In Experiment 1, one informant was absent (Guesser) and one present (Knower) during the food-hiding, and the dogs chose the Knower. However, when both informants were present, the dogs chose the informant that did the baiting, but this preference was less than when the Guesser was absent. In Experiments 2 and 3, a third experimenter hid the food while the informants covered their cheeks (Knower) or eyes (Guesser) with their hands, or were attentive (Knower) or inattentive (Guesser) to the food-hiding. In both cases, the dogs showed a significant preference for the Knower. In Experiment 4, the dogs showed no preference between the informants when they had equal perceptual access to the baiting, and were unsuccessful at selecting any container when the informants did not provide communicative cues.   Overall, the present research provides the most definitive evidence yet that domestic dogs may be able to attribute differential states of knowledge to human observers, and thus may possess a functional theory of mind.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of mind</field><field name="subject">dogs</field><field name="subject">knowledge attribution</field><field name="subject">perspective taking</field><field name="subject">social cognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and Temporal Changes in Tsunami Risk Perception in Canterbury</field><field name="creator">DuBois, Jennifer Faith</field><field name="description">Risk perception for rare, low-probability hazards, such as tsunamis, tends to be low due to individual's unfamiliarity with them and the tendency to see them as synonymous with non-occurrence events. Visitors to an area tend to have even lower risk perception and knowledge of hazards, warning systems and appropriate actions to take during an event. Risk perception, however, can increase, if only temporarily, after a catastrophic event, such as the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. To determine the changes in resident's knowledge and perception and the differences between those of residents and visitors two surveys were conducted. In the first survey interview style surveying was conducted at eleven locations in the coastal Christchurch and Banks Peninsula area of the Canterbury Region  The questionnaire was composed of scaled, open, and closed ended questions and the main themes included knowledge of risk, preparation and warnings, what to do during a tsunami, and changes since the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The second survey of five coastal communities was conducted via a postal questionnaire and was aimed at obtaining residential views. Survey data was then analysed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) statistical software. The residential data was compared with that of the non-residents to determine the differences in perception of residents and visitors. The residential information was then compared with survey data from the 2003 National Coastal Survey. Visitors knew less about general tsunami information such as when the last tsunami occurred and were less likely to believe that a tsunami could occur imminently. Non-residents reported less receipt of information and did considerably less information seeking. Differences in knowledge of warning systems were difficult to ascertain. The Boxing Day event certainly made an impact, increasing people's knowledge and awareness, though most likely only temporarily.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tsunami</field><field name="subject">risk perception</field><field name="subject">hazards survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Synthesis and Surface Studies of &#946;-Amino Acids &amp; &#946;-Peptides</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Kelly Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the synthesis of conformationally constrained &#946;-amino acids and &#946;-  peptides, and the electron transfer properties of the latter when immobilised on gold.  Additionally, cross metathesis on gold was investigated as a method for surface  functionalisation.  Chapter One introduces the concepts of electron transfer in nature, how it is facilitated by the  secondary structure in &#945;-peptides, and why &#946;-peptides might be useful for studying electron  transfer. This is followed by a discussion of the properties of &#946;-peptides, including the enhanced  stability and variety of helical secondary structures and the greater potential for functionalisation  of the peptide backbone when compared to &#945;-peptides. Finally, the conformational constraints  of ring-systems on cyclic amino acids is discussed, with reference to the stabilising effect of  these compounds on peptide secondary structures.  Chapter Two describes the electrochemical analysis of &#946;-hexapeptides immobilised on gold. The  chapter is prefaced by a discussion of the important electron transfer mechanisms for peptides,  the fabrication of peptide-gold self-assembled monolayer (SAM) interfaces, and the electron  transfer in helical &#945;-peptides. &#946;-Peptides containing an electroactive ferrocene moeity were  immobilised on gold and studied using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The latter  method was used to examine the dependence of the electron transfer rate on overpotential,  thereby determining the likely mode of electron transfer through the &#946;-peptides SS&#946;&#8326;Fc, Fc&#946;&#8326;SS  and SC&#8321;&#8325;&#946;&#8326;Fc. These peptides exhibited very weak dependence on overpotential, characteristic  of electron transfer behaviour of an electron hopping mechanism (which is also thought to occur  in helical &#945;-peptides). Both the dipole moment of the peptides and the structure of the sulfurlinker  group were found to be important in determining the rate of electron transfer. Conversely,  the equivalent &#945;-peptide SS&#945;&#8326;Fc exhibited electron transfer behaviour characteristic of the less  efficient tunnelling mechanism, which is thought to operate in strand-like peptides.  Chapter Three examines the application of cross metathesis, using a Grubbs' second generation  catalyst, as a means to functionalise olefin-terminated self-assembled monolayers on gold.  Abstract iv  Firstly, an introduction into the limited published research on cross metathesis on both planar  surfaces and nanoparticles is given. Olefin-terminated thiol 3.18, suitable for immobilisation on  gold, and solution phase olefin-terminated ferrocene 3.10 were synthesised as reactants for cross  metathesis studies. An analytical methodology was developed involving the cross metathesis of  surface-immobilised 3.18 with ferrocene 3.10 in dichloromethane, whereby the concentration of  electroactive cross metathesis product 3.22 was monitored electrochemically as a function of  time. The concentration of surface-immobilised product 3.22 was determined by integration of  the oxidation peak area and found to be highly dependent on both the concentration of  immobilised olefin reactant 3.18 and reaction time. Furthermore, the surface concentration of  ferrocenyl model disulfide 3.21 and thiol 2.18 decayed markedly upon addition of Grubb's  catalyst, as revealed by the decrease in the oxidation peak area, which suggested that catalystmediated  desorption was occurring.  Chapter Four details the solution-phase synthesis of ferrocene- and thiol-functionalised &#946;-  hexapeptides used in both the electron transfer studies described in chapter two, and in the  determination of secondary structure using circular dichroism and NMR techniques. The  synthesis of simple model compounds 4.14, 4.16 and 4.18 established the incompatibility of the  deprotection of methyl and benzyl ester protecting groups with protected-thiol and disulfide  linkers, leading to the use of N-hydroxysuccinmide-activated sulfur-linkers 4.20 and 4.22 in  further synthesis. A number of &#946;-hexapeptides were synthesised by amide coupling of &#946;-  tripeptides functionalised at the N- and C-termini. Structural studies of the methanol soluble &#946;-  hexapeptide 4.60 suggested that the covalent attachment of ferrocene moeity to the C-terminus  of a &#946;-peptide did not disrupt the formation of a 14-helix in solution. &#946;-peptides containing  functionality at both the C- and N-termini (such as SS&#946;&#8326;Fc, SS&#946;&#8326;Et and acetyl-protected  SC&#8321;&#8325;&#946;&#8326;Fc) were not suitable for solution phase structural studies; however, molecular modelling  suggested that helical conformations are the most stable these &#946;-peptides in solution phase.  Chapter Five outlines the synthesis of novel cyclic &#946;-amino acids by two different general  synthetic routes. The first uses an efficient conjugate addition/fluorination reaction of &#945;,&#946;-  unsaturated esters with lithiated chiral secondary amines to prepare the novel cyclopentyl- and  cyclohexyl-based fluorinated &#946;-amino acids 2.43a and 2.43b. The high diastereoselectivity of  this reaction, which introduces two stereocentres into the achiral unsaturated esters, is directed  by the configuration of the attacking amine. The second methodology utilizes the versatile ringclosing  metathesis reaction in the synthesis of novel cyclic &#946;-amino acids. A stereoselective  Abstract v  trans-alkylation of olefinic &#946;-amino acids gave the required &#946;-dienes 5.62 and 5.77. Optimised  cyclisation yields were achieved with a Grubb's 2nd generation catalyst for diene 5.62 and  Grubb's 1st generation catalyst for diene 5.77, to give the trans-cycloheptyl- and cyclooctylbased  &#946;-amino acids 5.63 and 5.78, respectively. The attempted synthesis of cyclononyl-based  &#946;-amino acid 5.87 using both catalysts yielded only cyclic dimer products 5.88 and 5.89. The  trans configuration of the 5.62 diene was confirmed by x-ray crystallography.

The Indian Ocean Tsunami on 26 December 2004  impacted 69 islands of the Maldives, killing 82 people, leaving 26 people missing and  15, 000 people internally displaced, making it the worst disaster in recorded history.  Following the event, the Government of the Maldives announced a Safer Island  Development Programme which seeks to provide the infrastructure necessary to adapt  to natural disasters.  The key focus of disaster management is to reduce the vulnerability of the  communities exposed to hazards and risks, and to help them to enhance their  resilience. Efforts have been made to develop safer and sustainable communities in all  corners of the developed and developing worlds. New Zealand Government  announced its effort to build safe and secure communities in 2007 while at a local  level the Christchurch City Council published the Safer Christchurch Strategy in  2005. Overseas, the Community Strategy 2000, outlines the vision of "A safe and  strong Island" at Isle of Wight United Kingdom.  The islands of the Maldives have natural characteristics which make them vulnerable  to disasters such as tsunami. This research has been able to identify the relationship  between these characteristics and the natural vulnerability of the islands using the  data that was collected following the Indian Ocean Tsunami. Out of 11 island, that  have been identified for the Safer Islands Development Programme, one island is  found to have very high natural vulnerability and 5 islands a high natural  vulnerability, from the island vulnerability index model developed through this study.  The Island Vulnerability Index model could be used to enhance the present Safer  Island Development Programme island selection criteria, to reduce the possibility of  'building risk' into the infrastructure development on the islands. The index could  also be used in the Environmental Impact Assessment studies to address the issue of  disasters, effective resources allocation in the Public Sector Infrastructure Programme  for 'building back better', and resource identification in land use planning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hazard mitigation</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">vulnerability assessment</field><field name="subject">Maldives</field><field name="subject">tsunami</field><field name="subject">Safer Islands</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of resilience - a model</field><field name="creator">Maginness, Alison</field><field name="description">The impetus for this study grew from observations in clinical practice that many individuals survived all sorts of hardships with minimal distress, or with the ability to tolerate their distress, and move on with their lives in a positive manner. A review of the literature led to the conclusions that the research investigating resilience was making minimal inroads into understanding what made these people different, and that the richness of who they were was being lost in the scientific process. This dissatisfaction led to the decision to explore the construct from a phenomenological framework, and to try and discover the essential elements of resilience through analysis of the subjective experience of resilience. A qualitative study involving thirteen participants identified by their peers as resilient was undertaken and the underlying themes of their stories were analysed. This led to the development of a model of resilience that attempted to balance the need for parsimony with that of explanatory breadth, and which had the potential to tolerate the complexity and instability of the construct itself. The model developed identified three core elements that embraced the construct of resilience. These included the physiological capacity to be resilient, and from this basis the ability to be adaptive and the ability to maintain well-being emerge. Factors identified with these elements include individual reactivity to and recovery from adverse events, the ability to be effective and efficient in the management of adverse events, and the beliefs about the world and the self that promote well-being when exposed to adverse events. The model has a basis within neurobiology and is framed within the context of Dynamic Systems Theory.

Scalar fields, found in many areas of physics, are frequently studied in  this context. This is partly due to their manifestation in the effective four dimensional theory of a number of underlying fundamental theories, most notably string theory.  This thesis is concerned with the effects of scalar fields on cosmological and black hole  solutions. By comparison, an analysis of an inhomogeneous cosmological model which  requires no extensions to general relativity is also undertaken.  In chapter three, examples of numerical solutions to black hole solutions, which  have previously been shown to be linearly stable, are found. The model includes at  least two scalar fields, non-minimally coupled to electromagnetism and hence possesses  non-trivial contingent primary hair. We show that the extremal solutions have finite temperature for an arbitrary coupling constant. Chapter four investigates the effects of higher order curvature corrections and scalar  fields on the late-time cosmological evolution. We find solutions which mimic many of the phenomenological features seen in the post-inflation Universe. The effects due to non-minimal scalar couplings to matter are also shown to be negligible in this context. Such solutions can be shown to be stable under homogeneous perturbations. Some  restrictions on the value of the slope of the scalar coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term  are found to be necessary to avoid late-time superluminal behaviour and dominant  energy condition violation.  A number of observational tests are carried out in chapter five on a new approach to averaging the inhomogeneous Universe. In this "Fractal Bubble model" cosmic  acceleration is realised as an apparent effect, due to quasilocal gravitational energy  gradients. We show that a good fit can be found to three separate observations, the type Ia supernovae, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale and the angular scale of the  sound horizon at last scattering. The best fit to the supernovae data is &#967;&#178; &#8771; 0:9 per degree of freedom, with a Hubble parameter at the present epoch of H0 = 61:7+1:4  -1:3 km  sec&#8315;&#185; Mpc&#8315;&#185; , and a present epoch volume void fraction of 0:76 &#177; 0:05.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cosmology</field><field name="subject">Black Holes</field><field name="subject">Supernova</field><field name="subject">Scalar Field</field><field name="subject">Gravity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms regulating the thermal acclimation of dark respiration in snow tussock and ryegrass</field><field name="creator">Clifford, Veronica Rose</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to identify the mechanisms that underpin changes in respiratory capacity during acclimation to temperature.  Dark respiration, enzyme activities and leaf ultrastructure were measured from ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in controlled environmental chambers and two species of native grass (Chionochloa rubra &amp; C. pallens) growing at different altitudinal ranges on Mount Hutt, Canterbury, New Zealand.   The overall hypothesis was that the changes in both mitochondrial numbers and enzyme activity underpin the greater respiratory capacity observed in response to decreasing temperatures.      Gas exchange measurements were carried out to measure rates of dark respiration (Rd) in leaves of both ryegrass and tussocks.  Respiratory homeostasis (full acclimation) was achieved in ryegrass leaves but only partial acclimation in both species of tussock plants.  Dark respiration rates for warm-grown ryegrass were greatly reduced compared to cool-grown grasses.   Rd was lower for C. rubra growing at the base of the mountain (450m) compared to plants at a higher altitude (1060m).  The dark respiration rates were also lower for C. pallens growing at 1070m than at 1600m.  When comparing Rd between high and low altitude plants, it was significantly lower in low altitude plants at 450m than at 1600m.    Oxygen consumption was measured in intact leaves and roots, crude mitochondria and isolated mitochondria from ryegrass to investigate whether a change in respiratory capacity was involved with changes in Rd.  Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was slightly reduced in warm leaves and roots (not significantly).  The respiratory capacity results from isolated mitochondria for C. rubra (at 450m and 1060m) and C. pallens (at 1070m and 1600m) were consistent with the hypothesis that plants from warm sites have lower respiratory capacity in comparison to plants from cool sites.  Based on these results and those of previous studies, it was concluded that respiratory flux for any given temperature is not simply determined by maximal capacities of the respiratory apparatus but rather a combination of the availability of substrate supply, the demand for respiratory products (i.e. ATP) and/or the maximal capacity of respiratory enzymes.    Utilizing transmission electron micrographs, it was found that mitochondria were significantly less abundant in warm-grown than cool-grown ryegrass mesophyll cells.  Mitochondria dimensions increased slightly between the cool and warm treatment.  At lower altitudes (C. rubra), there was a significant decrease in mitochondria numbers with decreasing elevation.  At higher altitudes (C. pallens), there was no noticeable change in mitochondria numbers between 1070m and 1600m.  It was concluded that mitochondrial abundance for the controlled and field experiments, and mitochondrial sizes in the field, were associated with changes in Rd.        The maximal activities of fumarase and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in isolated mitochondria from leaves of ryegrass and tussock were measured spectrophotometrically.  The results in the controlled experiment indicate that enzymes other than fumarase and SDH could be responsible for the increased respiratory capacity observed in cold acclimated leaves of ryegrass.  However, fumarase maximal activity was significantly reduced in C. rubra at low altitude compared with C. pallens growing at high altitude - this suggests that it may be involved in the differences in respiratory capacity and Rd between the two sites.  Succinate dehydrogenase did not differ significantly in response to altitude. The large difference between the two field sites for fumarase activity is comparable to the large difference in Rd and reduction in mitochondrial abundance and dimensions seen between the two sites.  This supports the overall hypothesis that cool-grown plants keep up with energy demands at low temperatures by increasing enzyme concentrations/capacity.    The results of this study are supportive of the hypothesis that growth in low altitudes and warm conditions will result in the reduction of Rd as a consequence of: (1) temperature sensitivity of the respiratory apparatus, resulting in the reduction of the respiratory capacities of mitochondria; (2) a reduction in mitochondria size and numbers; and as a consequence of this (3) a reduction in the activities of mitochondrial enzymes. However, these responses are species specific and vary according to the range of temperatures experienced by plants in the field and controlled environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acclimation</field><field name="subject">respiration</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne</field><field name="subject">Chionochloa rubra</field><field name="subject">Chionochloa pallens</field><field name="subject">ultrastructure</field><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="subject">fumarase</field><field name="subject">succinate dehydrogenase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Motor Connectivity in Selected Subjects with Stroke</field><field name="creator">Smale, Peter Rich</field><field name="description">Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI) is a recently-developed technique  that can image in vivo the white matter pathways of the central nervous system. This  study used 12-direction diffusion-weighted MRI data from nine stroke patients acquired as  part of a three-year stroke rehabilitation study coordinated by the Movement Neuroscience  Laboratory at the University of Auckland. DTI was used to investigate corticospinal connectivity.  From the FA maps, it is found that in those patients whose motor connectivity  has been compromised by the stroke to the extent that no motor evoked potential (MEP)  can be elicited from a selected affected muscle group, the asymmetry in mean FA values  in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules (PLICs) is correlated with functional recovery  as measured by the Fugl-Meyer clinical score. Using probabilistic tractography in  the contralesional hemisphere produced CST location and somatotopy results that were  consistent with those of previous studies. However, in the ipsilesional hemisphere, connectivity  results were highly variable. A measure of change in symmetry of mean connectivity  is found to correlate with functional recovery as measured by change in FM score. This  supports previous work which has correlated CST integrity and functional improvement  and it supports the theory that functional recovery after stroke depends on the extent to  which motor CNS symmetry can be regained in the new post-stroke architecture. It also  suggests that the movement of the fMRI activations occurs in such a way as to make the  most of the preserved white matter connectivity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DTI</field><field name="subject">diffusion tensor imaging</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">stroke</field><field name="subject">tractography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment effects on cluster development in the speech of 4-year-old children with speech disorder</field><field name="creator">Hide, Megan Jayne</field><field name="description">Purpose: This study examined the effectiveness of two differing interventions to improve the consonant cluster production in six children aged 4-5 years with concomitant speech sound disorder and expressive language difficulty.  Method: Participants were selected for the study based on a high incidence of consonant clusters errors in their speech production. All participants had at least 75% of their cluster production attempts in error in their initial speech sample. The participants were randomly assigned to receive 24 hours of either a phonological awareness intervention with integrated speech targets (Gillon &amp; Moriarty, 2005), or a morphosyntax intervention which alternated therapy sessions for language and speech targets (Haskill, Tyler, &amp; Tolbert, 2001) Each intervention was administered in two blocks of 6 weeks separated by a 6-week therapy break. Hour-long small group intervention sessions were attended twice weekly by all participants.  Consonant cluster productions were assessed using speech probes and standardised speech assessments. These were administered pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at follow-up 3 months post-intervention. These measures were compared to identify any improvement in (a) word-initial cluster accuracy as a result of /s/ clusters being targeted in the phonological awareness intervention;(b) word-final cluster accuracy as a result of word-final morphemes being targeted in the morphosyntax intervention; and (c) cluster element accuracy as a result of improved production of the phonemes as singletons.  Results: The data supported the hypotheses that targeting word-initial clusters in the phonological awareness intervention would lead to improvements in accuracy for target /s/ clusters, non-target /s/ clusters and singleton fricatives. Improvements in production of /s/ clusters, singleton fricatives, and untreated consonant + liquid  clusters were significant for all participants in this intervention type. The improvement for word initial /s/ clusters was greater than for the treatment group who received morphosyntax intervention.  The data was less convincing for the hypothesis that word-final cluster production would improve following intervention for word-final morphemes in the morphosyntax intervention. Although there was improvement in word-final production for two of the participants in this group, there were similar or greater improvements seen for the children who received phonological awareness intervention in which word-final clusters were not targeted.  The data supported the final hypothesis that improved production of singletons following speech intervention for these phonemes would result in improved accuracy for the phonemes when attempted in the context of clusters. All participants had improved accuracy of cluster elements that had been singleton targets during intervention.  Conclusion: The data showed that the Phonological Awareness intervention led to significant improvement in production of the target /s/ clusters, and generalised to increased accuracy for production of singleton fricatives, non-target /s/ clusters, and untreated consonant + liquid clusters. The Morphosyntax intervention resulted in less consistent improvement in production for target word-final clusters. In this programme, word-final clusters were implicitly treated through language intervention for word-final morphemes. The data indicates that improvement in consonant cluster production is facilitated when using explicit teaching methods to introduce and practice consonant clusters during intervention with children with speech sound disorder.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">therapy</field><field name="subject">clusters</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">preschool children</field><field name="subject">phonology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An overview of sugar culture in Morocco, particularly within a Berber community in Rastabouda</field><field name="creator">Travis, Georgia-Rose</field><field name="description">Using an anthropological perspective and referring primarily to work by Sidney Mintz, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu this dissertation focuses on the cultural importance of sugar in rural Berber communities within the Rif region of North Africa. In particular, Mintz is referred to with regard to slavery, Bourdieu in relation to habitus and Foucault in relation to normalization of mass beliefs as well as to events occurring in Morocco which relate directly to power structures within society. As well as providing information about the cultural importance of sugar, an historical account of the development of the sugar industry in Morocco is provided. This includes subsequent economic effects both in Morocco and Europe, with details in relation to the development and decline of the sugar industry, the introduction of slavery to Morocco as well as worldwide economic influences. The latter also demonstrates that sugar has been attributed power which is exerted not only within Berber culture from birth to death, but has had an influence throughout social and economic history since the introduction of the Qu&#8217;ran to the present day. An argument is developed which suggests that the presence of apparent discrimination and inequalities have arisen partly from a pure desire for sugar. Some long lasting health and environmental effects of processing sugar are outlined and discussed in relation to the health of Rif Berber. This includes a general outline of societal inequalities between genders in health care, including diseases such as diabetes. Tuberculosis along with diabetes, are discussed in order to show that they are social markers which reinforce various power structures within Moroccan communities. The emergence of slavery, land use, and the effects of the rise and subsequent decline of the sugar industry in Morocco are covered. Examples are given of how power shifted from those initially in authority to individuals at local level who complied with certain social norms and beliefs. This closely relates to the importance of sugar in Morocco, its relevance as an introduced crop along with the subsequent social, national and international changes which occurred and to a large extent remain firmly in place today. The long-lasting environmental impacts of the sugar industry represent both direct and indirect power struggles which are unlikely to be remedied without international intervention.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Berber communities</field><field name="subject">anthropological perspective</field><field name="subject">sugar</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implicit and explicit capture of attention: what it takes to be noticed</field><field name="creator">van Rij, Nathan Gordon</field><field name="description">Two Inattentional Blindness type experiments involving 446 participants were performed in order to examine how unexpected objects are noticed. Perception of these unexpected objects was measured using explicit and implicit measurements. Despite initial difficulty in determining implicit perception, results showed a dissociation between implicit measurements and explicit measurements, providing strong evidence for unconscious processing. Research into attention capture often emphasizes the role of either expectations or stimulus properties in attention capture; the current research examines both. Critical objects presented were either of a colour that participants were familiar with, or of a new colour. The different patterns of results for these two categories of objects provide evidence for two separate mechanisms of attention capture: a parallel process driven by the features of objects, and a serial process, driven by the intentions of the observer. Predications of the recent theoretical work produced by Most, Scholl, Clifford &amp; Simons, (2005) are examined, and support is obtained for their theoretical formulation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inattentional Blindness</field><field name="subject">Implicit Perception</field><field name="subject">Capture of Attention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anterior and lateral thalamic lesions in object-odour paired associate learning</field><field name="creator">Bell, Rati</field><field name="description">Diencephalic amnesia is thought to be the result of damage to a single thalamic structure that is responsible for the memory impairment.  However, an alternative view is that different thalamic structures contribute to the memory impairment in subtly different ways. Paired-associate learning is one important measure of learning and memory that is highly sensitive to disruption in people with amnesia or dementia. The current study will investigate the influence of lesions to two thalamic subregions, the anterior thalamic nuclei (AT) and the lateral thalamic nuclei (LT) in an object-odour paired associate learning task. Each of these subregions has been suggested by the literature as critical for amnesia after thalamus injury. The current study does not involve a place/ space component.  Both AT and LT lesions caused impairments in the object-odour paired associate task, but not in the simple discrimination tasks.  The results of this study provide new evidence to suggest that the anterior thalamic region may be responsible for more than spatial memory processing.  This result is inconsistent with those of Aggleton &amp; Brown (1999) that consider the AT to be part of an 'extended hippocampal system'.  The deficits observed from LT lesions in this study provide new insight into the lateral thalamic region's role in pattern processing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diencephalic amnesia</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">thalamus</field><field name="subject">anterior thalamic nuclei</field><field name="subject">lateral thalamic nuclei</field><field name="subject">paired-associate learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of a population of hoplodactylus pacificus, the common  New Zealand gecko (reptilia:gekkonidae)</field><field name="creator">McIvor, Ian Richard</field><field name="description">This study was intended to provide information on certain  aspects of the population ecology of H. pacificus.

Landscape-scale factors influence the importance, direction and magnitude of energy flows, but may also alter the ability of consumer organisms to respond to spatio-temporal changes in allochthonous prey availability. Here, I used flood and drying disturbance gradients to investigate interactions between these two processes on populations of a riparian fishing spider Dolomedes aquaticus (Pisauridae).   The abundance of aquatic insects with a winged adult stage, a major component of the diet of D. aquaticus, was markedly higher at less flood-prone rivers and declined with increasing flood disturbance. It was expected that spider populations would be largest at these stable rivers where the aquatic prey abundance was highest. However, a habitat (loose, unembedded riverbank rocks) manipulation revealed that the lack of scouring floods at these sites led to habitat-limited populations, preventing response to the increased prey resource. In fact a peak shaped relationship of spider biomass and abundance was found, with the largest spider populations at intermediately disturbed rivers. In addition, patchy habitat availability was the most likely cause of the small scale (4 m2) aggregation of spiders seen at the most stable and disturbed rivers. These patterns were also associated with strong interactions between the spiders. Stable isotope analysis of field collected spiders and an experimental manipulation of spider densities and food availability indicated that cannibalism rates were likely to be significantly higher at stable and disturbed rivers than those intermediate on the disturbance gradient. Differences in D. aquaticus population size structure and life history traits across the flood disturbance gradient were driven by interactions between resource availability, environmental stability and cannibalism rates. To separate the effects of habitat availability and aquatic prey abundance I used drying rivers, as the amount of aquatic insect prey alters as the water recedes. Desiccation mortality and low aquatic prey biomass most likely caused the spiders' spatial distribution and size class structure to alter in drying river reaches, potentially also leading to differences in cannibalism rates.  Overall, cross-ecosystem transfers of prey had large impacts on the distribution, cannibalism rates and life history traits of D. aquaticus but their effects were modified by the nature of the ecosystem boundary. Thus river flow regime controlled the magnitude of the subsidy and its use by a consumer. Hence, cross-ecosystem subsidies will not always lead to larger consumer populations and consumer responses will depend on interactions between large-scale processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">River</field><field name="subject">spatial subsidies</field><field name="subject">spider</field><field name="subject">aquatic insects</field><field name="subject">flood</field><field name="subject">drought</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individual identification, disease monitoring and home range of Leiopelma hamiltoni</field><field name="creator">Webster, Janelle T.</field><field name="description">Amphibian populations are declining on a global scale and although disease outbreaks are a commonly accepted hypothesis they are not the only one. My aims for my thesis were to study the home range of Leiopelma hamiltoni, to determine whether a photographic database could be used to individual identified them and monitor the health status of the population.   Habitat loss is a possible cause. For this reason monitoring an animals' home range is a possible method to detect early impacts the population is facing. By tracking 12 L. hamiltoni within a 12 m x 6 m grid on Maud Island, it was shown that the home range size can vary from 0.5 m2 to 25 m2 based on the minimum convex polygon method.   However, to track multiple individuals it is important to be able to distinguish among frogs. The commonly used methods of identification, such as toe clipping, pose potentially detrimental effects. Therefore, non-invasive methods based on natural markings need to be established. Through the use of the dark pigmented patterns found on the skin of L. hamiltoni individuals can be identified on recapture with a mean accuracy of 93%.  By developing a database to maintain the photographs used for individual identification, the database can also be used to monitor the status of the population. During 2003 numerous L. hamiltoni were observed with denuded patches predominantly on the facial region. By monitoring five individuals within the captive facility at the University of Canterbury it was discovered that frogs appear to be able to cure themselves.   Through researching the home range requirements and developing a photographic database to monitor the population status of L. hamiltoni, it will aid in the management of ensuring the long-term survival of this archaic species of frog.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amphibian decline</field><field name="subject">home range</field><field name="subject">study animal</field><field name="subject">individual identification</field><field name="subject">photographic record</field><field name="subject">population health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the effects of chain-length-dependent termination and propagation on the kinetics of radical polymerisation</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gregory Brian</field><field name="description">Radical polymerisation (RP) has for many years been an industrially important process, and the kinetics of the process remains an active area of research. As polymerisation proceeds, converting monomer (small molecules) into polymer (long chain molecules), chemical species of a variety of chain lengths are produced. Recent work has pointed toward the fact that rate coefficients for polymerisation reactions (specifically, termination and propagation) are often dependent on the chain-length of the reacting species. The focus of this thesis is to study the effects of chain-length-dependent reactions on the kinetics of RP, by using computer-based modeling and comparing the results of such modeling with experimental data. This enables the understanding of otherwise inexplicable trends and the building of more mechanistically detailed and accurate models for RP kinetics.  In Chapter 2, a new model for termination is developed, connecting observations and analyses of termination kinetics at short chain lengths (particularly small molecule studies) with other observations and analyses at long chain lengths (conventional RP kinetics studies) in order to construct a model for termination that is shown to be capable of coherently describing termination kinetics at any chain length. In Chapter 3, this new model for termination is tested at short chain lengths on polymerisations with large quantities of added chain transfer agent. With  the inclusion of chain-length-dependent propagation in the model, the model for termination is validated. Chapter 4 is aimed at extending an existing reduced-variable, compact, 'universal' description of steady-state RP kinetics by incorporating all known chain-length dependent reactivities. This both increases computational efficiency over other approaches and provides easily evaluated, approximate analytical expressions for RP kinetics. This foundational theory is applied in Chapter 5 to reach a deeper understanding of the behaviour of the model, and show how experimental data may readily  be analysed to extract information about chain-length-dependent termination kinetics. In Chapter 6, the effect of chain-length dependent reactivities on the important technique of single-pulse pulsed-laser polymerisation is investigated, and this technique is validated as the best experimental method for investigation of termination kinetics.  In general, a central result of this thesis is that chain-length-dependent reactivities, when acknowledged and properly incorporated into models, can explain many phenomena in RP kinetics which otherwise seem difficult to account for. No exceptions to this principle have been found.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radical polymerisation kinetics</field><field name="subject">computer-based modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulating Disaster Recovery Plans for New Zealand: using a  case study of the 1931 Napier Earthquake</field><field name="creator">Hollis, Melanie</field><field name="description">Worldwide, the risks from natural and technological hazards has been mounting at an  accelerating rate, improvements in forecasting and warning systems have reduced  deaths, however monetary losses from disasters are overwhelming (Burby, 2004).

It has grown to bloom conditions in all rivers it inhabits, which has caused impacts to the river systems, loss in recreation value, and economic losses.  The pathways and vectors of dispersal are difficult to control and hence it continues to spread throughout the South Island. Laboratory experiments assessed the survivability of D. geminata in different environmental conditions, a range of combinations of light availability, temperature and moisture. Experiments in the field were based in the Waitaki River to determine growth rates of D. geminata.     D. geminata is growing in a greater range of temperature and light conditions than previously recognised.  In cool to cold conditions with a little water this diatom can survive up to 1500h, the colder temperatures also increase survivability in the dark.  However, D. geminata has reduced survivability in warm, damp conditions, up to 60h.  In the Waitaki River D. geminata is attaining biomass of 2.51mg mm-2 over six weeks during summer. This high biomass is causing a change in biotic and abiotic conditions. Longevity of survival and the range of conditions in which it can survive increases the risk of spread throughout New Zealand and the world.    There are considerable problems with invasive species and international trade.  Policies aiming to reduce international invasions due to trade are becoming more prevalent as the consequences of invasion are more obvious and costly. New Zealand has been able to implement polices in the last decade that has reduced the number and variety of incursions. However these policies did not stop D. geminata arriving.  This shows that even with the best policies species can invade fragile ecosystems.  Central and local government policies surrounding management of invasive aquatic species were reviewed. Central and local government policies were developed to reduce the spread of D. geminata, however they are not effective as the diatom is still dispersing. Further research is required to elucidate means of dispersal in New Zealand, in particular the importance of dispersal by animals compared with that by humans, and the importance of continuing international dispersal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Didymosphenia geminata</field><field name="subject">biosecurity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telephone use and performance in cochlear implant candidates</field><field name="creator">Allen, Karen</field><field name="description">Telephones are an integral part of everyday life in today's society. It is well known that hearing impaired people have difficulty understanding speech on the telephone. The ability to use the telephone is commonly reported as one of the many benefits of cochlear implantation. Assessment for a cochlear implant (CI) includes a variety of aspects related to communication and hearing ability. Included in the case history, mention is made whether the person can use the telephone. The purpose of the present study was firstly to identify if the inability to use the telephone could be used a predictor for suitability for a cochlear implant. It was also purposed to determine if telephone ability could be assessed by self-reported measures. The participants were 13 severe to profoundly hearing impaired people who had previously undergone candidacy assessment for a cochlear implant. Each participant was evaluated on their use and understanding of speech on the telephone. Participants were separated into two groups: those who were candidates for a cochlear implant and those who were not. Speech perception testing was evaluated using a recording of CUNY sentences on the telephone. Results indicated that cochlear implant candidates correctly perceived a significantly lower number of words on the telephone than non-candidates. Use of the telephone was evaluated using a 51-item questionnaire. Results indicated that there was no significant difference in self-reported use of the telephone between cochlear implant candidates and non-candidates. The differences in speech perception understanding on the telephone were most likely due to the overall better hearing levels of the non-candidates. The clinical implications of the present study are considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cochlear implant</field><field name="subject">telephones</field><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of the New Zealand Falcon (Falco Novaeseelandlae Gmelin 1788)</field><field name="creator">Fox, Nicholas Christopher</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken for two reasons. The first was that  the New Zealand Falcon was largely unstudied, and research on its basic  biology would provide a base-line for further work. The second was that  the topic covered a number of disciplines which meant that, as an  academic exercise, the scope was broad rather than narrowly specialised.  The easiest projects to write up are those in which there are so  many data that the figures almost speak for themselves or those in  which there are so few data that one is free to speculate.  Unfortunately most of the chapters in this study fall into a middle  category in which the samples are small and statistical probabilities  are marginal. Also, in trying to maintain a broad approach I have been  compelled to sacrifice depth and so each chapter tends to reveal more  questions than it answers.  While writing, I have been acutely aware of the differences  between potential readers. Overseas raptor specialists on the one hand  may know little about New Zealand's avifauna and ecology, and New  Zealand biologists, familiar with New Zealand, may know little about  the ways of raptors. Therefore a short glossary of terms has been  included.  Briefly, the study has set out to answer a few straightforward  questions such as 'Is the Falcon monotypic?', 'What is it related to?',  'Why are the females larger?', 'What do they eat?', 'How do they hunt?',  'How big is their range?', 'What is their breeding biology?', 'Will  they breed in captivity?', 'What do they die of?', 'Where are they?',  'How many are there?'. Some of these questions, such as the diet,  can be answered with some precision; others, such as the problem of  sexual dimorphism, can only be answered in a general way.  Because I was strongly advised at the start of this project that  a study of the New Zealand Falcon was not feasible, I started a  subsidiary project on the Australasian Harrier (Circus approximans).  This was soon abandoned and although the results have been published  (Fox 1977b) they have not been included in this thesis. Certain  portions of this thesis, such as 'Rangle' (Chapter 5.15 -5.19),  'Diet values and food consumption' (5.8-5.11) and 'The shape of nesting  territories' (8.9) have already been published or are in press, but for  the sake of continuity have been kept as an integral part of the thesis.  To a certain extent I have been handicapped by lack of raptor  specialists in New Zealand with whom I could discuss my work. Another  aspect of New Zealand's isolation is the difficulty in obtaining certain  literature. Thus Chapter Four has suffered from my not having access to  Noel Snyder's and James Wiley's recent monograph on Sexual Dimorphism.  The compensation for this isolation has been the' privilege of working  on such a magnificent, and unstudied, raptor.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand falcon</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Expansion of Settlement in Early Christchurch, 1850-62.</field><field name="creator">Retter, David Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an in depth study of  the expansion of settlement in Christchurch between  1850-62, the pre-Municipal Council years. It is  confined spatially to the 'central city' area  within the four Avenues.  Four research problems are studied:  (1) The laying out of Christchurch by the New  Zealand Company surveyors for the Canterbury  Association, in particular, the reasons for the  use of a grid street pattern. It was found  that many factors were involved in its use.  These included the personal preferences  of the surveyors and the Association committee  members, the topographic nature of the site  chosen and contemporary planning convention.  (2) The initial selection of town sections by the  colonists and the reasons behind their choices.  The 'orders of choice' of the sections have been  tabulated and mapped to show section preference  and how the settlers perceived the economic  value of particular areas of the town grid for  their commercial prospects. Town section  auctions, leases, sales and subdivisions as  well as church land are investigated.  (3) The sale of the Town Reserves surrounding the  town section area is also studied; the reason  for their early sale, the nature and  characteristics of the sales including prices  and purchasers and their occupations. It was  found that the prices paid were significantly  related to the spatial positions of the lots  within the Reserve blocks and to the time of their  sale, in response to contemporary land values.  There was no significant relationship between  prices and the occupations of the buyers.  (4) Public works undertaken by the Association and  the Provincial Government are studied and their  relationship with immigration and population figures.  The scale of public works carried out at particular  times was found to relate both to available  finance and to immigration, the source of labour.  Various aspects of public works, for example,  street and footpath formation and bridging and  drainage work were found to be indicative of  differential growth between periods of depression  and prosperity.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christchurch</field><field name="subject">Canterbury Association</field><field name="subject">surveying</field><field name="subject">town planning</field><field name="subject">public works</field><field name="subject">land speculation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of airway protection in ageing and Parkinson's disease</field><field name="creator">Leow, Li Pyn</field><field name="description">Safe and efficient swallowing requires integrity of both motor and sensory systems. Prior studies have established that motor impairment in individuals with PD frequently manifests as  abnormalities in swallowing biomechanics. In contrast, very few studies have investigated the  contribution of sensory impairment towards pharyngeal biomechanics and airway protection  in this patient cohort. This area should be addressed in light of evidence that the severity of limb motor dysfunction in PD does not reliably predict severity of dysphagia. Emerging data  suggests that dysphagia in PD cannot be solely attributed to motor impairment, but may also  be influenced by deficits in sensory aspects of airway protection. As an example, silent aspiration in up to 100% has been reported in individuals with PD due to laryngopharyngeal  sensory deficits have. Even so, current research lacks information on the integration of both  motor and sensory components that make up the swallowing process.    The aim of this study was to document changes in airway protection with age, in PD and across severity levels of PD. The project was comprised of two parts. In part one, three parallel studies were conducted to assess a series of both motor and sensory airway mechanism (Chapters 4 to 9). In the first study, 16 young (8 males, age range 21.3 - 32.4) and 16 elder adults (8 males, age range 61.5 - 84.7), were assessed to investigate changes in airway protection that accompany ageing. In the second study, data from individuals diagnosed with PD across severity levels (Hoehn-Yahr 1 - 4, age range 64.2 - 84.5) were age and gender-matched to 16 healthy elders in order to examine the effects of PD on airway protection. In the third, the impact of disease severity was studied with data from 16 individuals in the earlier stages (Hoehn-Yahr &#8804; 2, 13 males, age range 51.3 - 82.5, ) compared to 16 individuals in the later stages (Hoehn-Yahr &#8805; 2.5, 10 males, age range 61.5 - 78.9). In part two of this project, two smaller, pilot studies were completed to probe the influence of pharmacologic and behavioural treatments on airway protection mechanisms. In the first pilot study, the effect of pharmacotherapy on airway protection was investigated in 10 patients 'on' and 'off' levodopa (Chapter 10). In the second study, 5 patients were assessed before and after completing the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) to document effects of speech  rehabilitation on airway protection (Chapter 11).    Multimodality assessment elicited data from all  participants on both motor and sensory components of airway protection (Chapter 3). Specifically, breathing-swallowing coordination (BSC) and swallowing apnoea (SA) were captured using simultaneous directional nasal airflow and surface electromyography (sEMG). Standard, closed-loop  spirometry was used to assess pulmonary function. Swallowing biomechanics were screened using a validated timed test of swallowing efficiency and further evaluated using fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Finally, chemo-sensation of the laryngopharynx  was determined with the administration of the inhalation cough challenge while mechanosensation  was examined using FEES.    Results suggest that motor control for airway protection is reasonably robust in PD, although  sensory response is impaired. The predominant pattern for swallowing respiratory coordination was mid-expiration for all participants regardless of age and disease severity (Chapter 4). Individuals with PD demonstrated a reduction in average time and volume per swallow, leading to an overall decrease in swallowing capacity (Chapter 5). No difference was found for swallowing efficiency between those in early and later stages of PD. Pulmonary function measures were not significantly different as a function of age, PD or PD severity (Chapter 6). In summary, results from motor assessments contributing to airway protection support the robustness of breathing-swallowing coordination (BSC) and pulmonary function across research groups, but identify a reduction in overall swallowing efficiency in PD.    Results from sensory assessments contributing to airway protection revealed that chemosensation  was not different between age groups but base of tongue mechano-sensation was diminished in individuals with PD. Natural cough thresholds did not differ between young adults and elders but when asked to stifle coughing, elders were less able to do so compared to young adults (Chapter 7). For the first time, a reduction in mechano-reception at the base of tongue was recorded in individuals with PD (Chapter 8). These patients also demonstrated increased post swallow residual (Chapter 5), which offers an explanation for the complaint of globus in this population. These assessments highlight some compromise to sensory aspects of airway protection in PD. Overall, dysphagia had a negative impact on the quality of life of individuals with PD and even more as disease severity progresses (Chapter 9).    Results from part two of the study looking at the effects of therapeutic interventions on airway  protection revealed some unexpected findings. In chapter 10, results showed a reduction in  pulmonary function when 'on' levodopa, but no differences in swallowing efficiency, BSC, or  laryngopharyngeal chemo- and mechano-reception were observed. These results suggested a  reduction in pulmonary function with levodopa without any increase in risk of airway protection compromise1. Unexpectedly and documented for the first time, the percentage of post swallow inspiration increased after LSVT (Chapter 11) but as with the levodopa study, this was also not accompanied by any apparent increase in aspiration risk. An increase in submental surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude across all 5 participants may serve as a proxy measure of improvement in hyolaryngeal excursion. Finally, participants reported an overall improvement in social functioning and communication after LSVT.  In conclusion, this study provided evidence that mechano-sensory aspect of airway protection  is diminished in individuals with PD, possibly compromising airway protection. Patients not  only demonstrated increased residue but the lack of sensation may prevent clearing or spontaneous multiple swallows. Overall, airway protection is maintained in ageing but swallowing efficiency declines in the presence of PD. This study contributes significantly to current research efforts in PD by expanding on existing reports regarding motor aspects of airway protection. Specifically, BSC, swallowing efficiency and evaluation of biomechanics using FEES research have never before been investigated exclusively in the PD population.    Finally, the chemo- and mechano-sensation evaluated in this study are an important addition  to the limited evidence that sensory impairment in individuals with PD potentially compromises airway protection. Results of the present study will serve as a platform upon which future studies may compare and expand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">airway protection</field><field name="subject">parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">swallowing</field><field name="subject">deglutition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancing spoken and written language development in children with childhood apraxia of speech</field><field name="creator">McNeill, Brigid</field><field name="description">Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) are likely to experience severe  and persistent spoken and written language disorder. There is a scarcity of intervention  research, however, investigating techniques to improve the speech and literacy outcomes  of this population. The series of 5 experiments reported in this thesis investigated  phonological awareness and early reading development in children with CAS and trialled  a new intervention designed to advance the spoken and written language development of  those affected.  In the first experiment (presented in Chapter 2), a comparison of 12 children with  CAS, 12 children with inconsistent speech disorder (ISD), and 12 children with typical  speech-language development (TD) revealed that children with CAS may be particularly  susceptible to phonological awareness and reading deficits. There was no difference in  the articulatory consistency and speech severity of the CAS and ISD groups, and no  difference in the receptive vocabulary of the CAS, ISD, and TD groups. The children  with CAS exhibited poorer phonological awareness scores than the comparison groups  and had a greater percentage of participants performing below the expected range for  their age on letter knowledge, real word decoding, and phonological awareness normative  measures. The children with CAS and ISD performed inferiorly than the children with  TD on a receptive phonological representation task. The results showed that the children  with CAS had a representational component to their disorder that needed to be addressed  in intervention.  In the second experiment (presented in Chapter 3), a follow-up pilot study was  conducted to examine the long-term effects of a previously conducted intensive  integrated phonological awareness programme (7 hours of intervention over 3 weeks) on  2 children with CAS. The children aged 7;3 and 8;3 at follow-up assessment had  previously responded positively to the intervention. Results showed that the children  were able to maintain their high accuracy in targeted speech repeated measures over the  follow-up period. One child was also able to maintain her high accuracy in phonological  awareness repeated measures. The children performed superiorly on a standardised  phonological awareness measure at follow-up than at pre-intervention. Non-word reading  ability showed a sharp increase during the intervention period, while minimal gains were  made in this measure over the follow-up period. The findings suggested that an integrated  intervention was a potential therapeutic approach for children with CAS.  In the third experiment (presented in Chapter 4), the effectiveness of an integrated  phonological awareness programme was evaluated for the 12 children (identified in the  first experiment) aged 4 to 7 years with CAS. A controlled multiple single-subject design  with repeated measures was employed to analyse change in trained and untrained speech  and phoneme segmentation targets. A comparative group design was used to evaluate the  phonological awareness, reading, and spelling development of the children with CAS  compared to their peers with TD over the intervention. The children participated in two 6-  week intervention blocks (2-sessions per week) separated by a 6-week withdrawal block.  Seven children with CAS made significant gains in their production of trained and  untrained speech words with 7 of these children demonstrating transfer of skills to  connected speech for at least one target. Ten children showed significant gains in  phoneme awareness, and 8 of these children demonstrated transfer of skills to novel  phoneme awareness tasks. As a group, the children with CAS demonstrated accelerated  development over the intervention period in letter knowledge, phonological awareness,  word decoding, and spelling ability compared to their peers with typical development.  In the fourth experiment (presented in Chapter 5), the speech, phonological  awareness, reading, and spelling skills of children with CAS and TD were re-evaluated 6-  months following completion of the intervention programme. A measure of reading  accuracy and reading comprehension in a text reading task was administered to the  children with CAS. There was no difference in the performance of the children with CAS  in post-intervention and follow-up assessments. The children with CAS and children with  TD presented with similar relative change in phonological awareness, reading, and  decoding measures over the follow-up period. The connected reading performance of  children with CAS mirrored their phonological awareness and decoding skills. The  findings demonstrated that children with CAS were able to maintain gains achieved  during the intervention but may need further support to promote sustained development  in written language.  In the fifth experiment (presented in Chapter 6), the long-term effects of the  integrated phonological awareness programme for identical twin boys who participated in  the research intervention at pre-school were examined. The study examined Theo and  Jamie's spoken language, phonological awareness, reading, and spelling development  during their first year of schooling. The results pointed to the benefit of providing  phonological awareness within a preventative framework for children with CAS. Theo  and Jamie experienced continued growth in speech and phonological awareness skills.  They exhibited age-appropriate reading and spelling development during their first year  of formal literacy instruction.  It was concluded from this series of experiments that children with CAS are  particularly vulnerable to phonological awareness and early reading difficulty, and that an  integrated phonological awareness intervention is an effective means of developing  speech, phonological awareness, reading, and spelling skills in most children with CAS.  The intervention appears to target processes underlying spoken and written language  development in this population. The results are discussed within a phonological  representation deficit hypothesis of CAS and clinical implications of the findings are  highlighted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Childhood apraxia of speech</field><field name="subject">phonological awareness</field><field name="subject">phonological awareness intervention</field><field name="subject">speech intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple four-mirror anastigmatic systems with at least one infinite conjugate</field><field name="creator">Rakich, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an analytical approach to the optical design of four-mirror anastigmatic optical systems. In all cases investigated here the object is at infinity. In the introduction the field of reflecting, or "catoptric", optical system design is discussed and given some historical context. The concept of the "simplest possible reflecting anastigmat" is raised in connection with Plate Diagram analysis. It is shown that four-plate systems are in general the simplest possible anastigmats, and that four-plate systems comprised of four spherical mirrors are the last family of "simplest possible reflecting anastigmats" for which the complete solution set remains unknown. In chapter 2 third-order aberration coefficients in wavefront measure are derived in a form that is particularly suitable for Plate Diagram analysis. These coefficients are subsequently used to describe the Plate Diagram, and to detail the application of the Plate Diagram to the survey of all possible solutions for four-spherical-mirror anastigmats. The Plate Diagram technique is also generalized to investigate its use as an optical design tool. In the example given a generalized Plate Diagram approach is used to determine solutions for four-mirror anastigmats with a prescribed first-order layout and a minimum number of conicoids.  In chapter 3 results are presented for the survey of four-spherical-mirror anastigmats in which all elements are required to be smaller than the primary mirror. Two novel families of four-spherical-mirror anastigmats are presented and these are shown to be the only examples of four-spherical-mirror systems that exist under the given constraints.  Chapter 4 gives an example of the application of Plate Diagram analysis to the design of an anastigmatic system with a useful first-order layout and a minimum number of conicoid mirrors. It is shown that systems with useful first-order layouts and only one conicoid mirror can be obtained using this method.  In chapter 5 results are presented of the survey of all remaining four-spherical-mirror anastigmatic systems: that is systems in which elements are allowed to exceed the diameter of the entrance pupil, which includes systems with concave and convex primary mirrors. A wide variety of solutions are presented and classified according to both the underlying geometry of the solutions and the first-order layouts. Of these systems only one has been reported in previously published literature.  The results presented in this thesis complete the set of "four-plate" reflecting anastigmats, and it can now be said that all possible solutions for four-spherical-mirror anastigmatic systems have been determined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Aberration</field><field name="subject">Geometrical Optics</field><field name="subject">Anastigmatic Telescope</field><field name="subject">Reflecting Telescope</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the spatial distribution of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rind, Esther Christiane</field><field name="description">Background  Infection with Campylobacter is thought to account for about 5% - 14% of all food and waterborne diarrhoea cases worldwide. By international standards, New Zealand has extremely high rates of campylobacteriosis which are thought to be the highest reported rates worldwide. The incidence has been steadily increasing since 1980 (when the disease became notifiable), reaching a peak of cases in 2003 (396/100,000). Although different surveillance systems complicate international comparisons, New Zealand's particularly high rate still lacks a conclusive explanation.     Aims  This study investigates the geographical distribution of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand and the relative importance of factors assumed to be affecting the distribution of this disease, including those related to climate, landuse, water and food. The approach aims to explain why certain areas might increase the probability of becoming infected.     Methodology  A Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to visualise the disease rate, investigate potential disease clustering and identify outliers. Hierarchical regression, including the analysis of residuals, is applied to analyse the variables in their complex interrelation and to investigate whether there is statistical evidence explaining the geographical variation in campylobacteriosis. This study is undertaken at the territorial local authority level, as all required data are available at this spatial scale and covers the period 1997 to 2005.    Results and conclusion  There is a large geographical variation in campylobacteriosis across New Zealand, ranging from an average annual rate of 97/100,000 to 526/100,000 per territorial local authority (TLA). Generally, there is statistical evidence for global and local clustering of the disease rate. There are upper and lower outliers of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand; however, higher rates primarily appear in the South Island. The hierarchical modelling confirms statistical significance for some of the environmental and sociodemographic variables. The final model explains about 58% of the variation in campylobacteriosis, and the residuals reflect this variation relatively accurately in approximately 75% of all TLAs. Although the evaluation of the results is confronted with a number of challenges, it is concluded that socioeconomic and demographic factors are crucial factors in explaining the observed spatial patterns in the notification data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial distribution</field><field name="subject">campylobacteriosis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxometric Investigation of Multi-Impulsive Bulimia</field><field name="creator">Hanson, Aimee Hanson</field><field name="description">Previous researchers have proposed that Multi-impulsive Bulimia (MIB), a constellation of self-destructive impulsive behaviours including theft, self-harm, suicide attempts, sexual disinhibition, and substance use, may be a distinct sub-type of Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Prior to this study, the validity of MIB as a subtype of BN had not been empirically examined. In the current study, taxometric procedures were used to address the question of whether MIB represents a distinct subtype or occurs on one or more continua. Participants were women (N = 419) diagnosed with BN seeking treatment at a residential eating disorders facility. Taxometric procedures used were mean above below minus a cut, maximum covariance, and latent mode analyses. Indicators were bulimic behaviours (bingeing and purging), theft, suicide attempts, self-harm and alcohol use. Analyses included comparisons with simulated taxonic and dimensional data. Results were inconsistent across analyses, perhaps due to problems with indicator validity.

Outbreaks often causes large financial losses, usually represented by  the waste of study or work hours, the involvement of emergency personnel,  hospitalisation of those involved, and disruption of routine. Very few psychological  studies have been produced to date, and some of the issues raised were the  methodological difficulties in defining and limiting the phenomena as an object of  scientific inquiry. An analysis of psychological variables utilising case study  methodology and the historical method indicates that these variables are present in  episodes of mass hysteria, and that they are likely to play a key role in triggering the  outbreak, in spreading symptoms, maintaining the mass hysteric's behaviour, and  ending the episodes. This is an exploratory study, and further research remains to be  done on all aspects of the role of psychological variables in these outbreaks.

The study had two aims: (1) to assess whether  faeces from unfamiliar rhinos carry information that influences the behaviour of adult rhinos in a  zoo habitat, and (2) to identify olfactory constituents of the faeces that potentially stimulate the  change in behaviour.  Faeces samples were collected from seven male, female, and juvenile rhinos residing at Hamilton  and Auckland zoos and from one male rhino held in a separate enclosure at Orana Park. From  each sample type six individual samples of 2 kg each were collected. The samples were put in  plastic bags and kept frozen at -1O&#8451;. As controls, samples from peat, peat with testosterone, and  heated faeces were used.  An individual thawed sample was presented at a time to the subjects by placing it into the  enclosure. Behaviour and positions of the subjects was monitored for 3 h. In addition weather  data was collected.  Each exposure test of one sample type consisted of at least six observation sessions during which  one two-kg dung specimen was presented to the subjects in the Orana Park enclosure. Each  session consisted of nine trial periods of 15 min, during which each subject was observed  individually and all actions ofthe animal were recorded.  There was a strong response of the subjects to faeces from male donors. The bull reacted with  increased frequency of spray urinating. The bull habituated to the faecal stimulus within about an  hour. Other strongly affected behaviour categories of all subjects included smelling the ground,  scanning, and walking. The distance between the subjects and frequency of synchronous  behaviour of the subjects was affected by various samples to a lesser degree.  Correlation of faecal compounds with territorial behaviour activities and chemical analysis  identified possible signalling compounds such as esters of low molecular weight fatty acids  (propanoic, butanoic, and pentanoic acids) and perhaps testosterone and terpenoids. Even  simulated control samples consisting of peat impregnated with testosterone initiated some  response.  Overall, faecal scent marks were found to stimulate multifaceted behavioural effects of captive  white rhinoceros. Chemical analyses of faeces identified new olfactory components not  previously attributed to male faeces, and which could act as male signalling compounds.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Rhinceros</field><field name="subject">faeces</field><field name="subject">scent marks</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is debt bad for students? The effects of student debt on course selection, motivation, happiness, and academic performance.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Judy Zhe Cun</field><field name="description">The previous research on student debt indicates that the financial concerns associated with being in debt have a significant effect on the individual's academic performance. In the present study, a sample of 328 current students at the University of Canterbury was questioned to identify the effects of student debt on students' course selection, motivation, happiness and academic performance. Students' debt levels increased with the level of university study, and the largest form of student borrowing was from the Student Loan Scheme. While students with no debt performed better academically than those with debt, students' attitudes towards debt were found to influence the relationship between debt level and academic performance. Students who were tolerant towards debt performed better as they accumulated more debt while students who were intolerant performed worse.

Dimeric mutants of this enzyme have been found in previous work to be largely inactive,  due to the trapping of a covalent adduct. Partial restoration of catalytic activity has been  achieved by incubation in the presence of the substrate pyruvate to displace the adduct. It  was hypothesized that the buttressing of dimeric units against one another in the wildtype  tetrameric form of DHDPS provides stability in the dimer interface, necessary to  maintain optimum catalytic performance and substrate specificity. We hypothesized that  buttressing a dimeric DHDPS mutant against a surface would result in restoration of  catalytic activity by mimicking the buttressing proposed to occur in the tetrameric  structure.  To test this hypothesis, dimeric DHDPS mutants were immobilised against an agarose  support and the immobilised enzymes characterised. Three DHDPS mutants were  prepared, the double mutant DHDPS-C20S/L167C was produced by mutagenesis and a  crystal structure obtained in collaboration with Dr Renwick Dobson. Two other mutants,  DHDPS-Ll67C and DHDPS-Ll97Y were also over expressed and purified. The  quaternary structures of the three mutants were characterised in solution, DHDPS-Ll67C  was determined to be tetrameric, DHDPS-C20S-Ll67C was found to equilibrate between  tetramer and dimer and DHDPS-Ll97Y was confirmed as a dimer, consistent with  previous findings. Modification experiments indicated that the sulfhydryl groups of  DHDPS-C20S/L167C were available for immobilisation. Activation experiments  indicated that both DHDPS-Ll67C and DHDPS-Ll97Y activated. These results were in  accord with those of others in indicating that the displacement of an a-ketoglutarate  adduct from the active site was responsible for the activation of mutant DHDPS enzymes.  Wild-type DHDPS and the mutants were immobilised through amine and sulfhydryl  groups. The free and immobilised enzymes were rigorously characterised, with thermal  stability, pH optima, kinetic and lysine inhibition properties determined and compared to  wild-type DHDPS. Following immobilisation, substrate affinity was found to decrease  for wild-type and mutant enzymes, wild-type KmPyr = 0.26 mM free, 0.8-1.2 mM  immobilised, Km(S)-ASA = 0.10 mM free, 1.5-2.5 mM immobilised. Lysine inhibition was  determined to be largely unaffected by immobilisation. The largest change in K, was an  increase to double that of the free enzyme. Restoration of some catalytic activity was  found following the immobilisation of dimeric DHDPS-Ll97Y, the immobilised enzyme  was 31 &#177; 12% more active than free DHDPS-Ll97Y. DHDPS-C20S/L167C was also  found to immobilise as a dimer. Comparison ofthe immobilised DHDPS-C20S/L167C  dimer with a derivatised free dimeric form ofthis enzyme indicated that an increase from  3% to 9% of wild-type activity had resulted from immobilisation. These results  supported the hypothesis that buttressing of a dimeric mutant of DHDPS against a  support surface would increase catalytic activity and that buttressing across the dimerdimer  interface is essential for optimal catalytic activity in DHDPS enzymes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dihydrodipicolnate synthase</field><field name="subject">catalytic activity</field><field name="subject">dimeric DHDPS mutants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the Effects of Xenoestrogens on the Protein Levels of  the Estrogen Receptors</field><field name="creator">Lang, Claudia Nicole</field><field name="description">There has been an increase in reports of male reproductive disorders that include  male infertility and testicular cancer worldwide. It has been suggested that agents such as  xenoestrogens could be responsible. Xenoestrogens are chemical compounds that mimic  the action of estrogens by binding to the estrogen receptors (ERs). The response ofa  testicular cell line to estrogenic pesticides was examined. The effect of estrogenic  pesticides on the growth and protein levels of ER&#945; and ER&#946; of mouse Sertoli cells was  investigated. Pyrethroids are widely used insecticides due to their insecticidal potency  and low mammalian toxicity. In this study, the estrogenicity ofpyrethroid chemicals were  tested using the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. The toxic effects of the pyrethroid  compounds cypermethrin, 3-(4-hydroxy-phenoxy)benzyl alcohol (metabolite of  permethrin), and the commercial product (Ripcord Plus) were evaluated. The Sertoli cells  were exposed to pyrethroids at concentrations of 0.36 nM and 36 &#181;M (cypermethrin and  Ripcord Plus), and 0.69 nM and 69 &#181;M (metabolite) for 100 h. The expression of the ERs  was analysed through the use of Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)  experiments. The most toxic pyrethroid was the metabolite, followed by Ripcord Plus  then cypermethrin. Overall the exposure of the cells to cypermethrin (36 &#181;M), Ripcord  Plus (36 &#181;M) and the metabolite (69 &#181;M) caused a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in ER&#945;  levels. In the cultures exposed to the metabolite (69 &#181;M), there was also a significant  increase in ER&#946; levels. There appears to be a relation between cell toxicity and an  increase in ER&#946; levels, which supports the theory that ER&#946; promotes apoptosis.  Pyrethroids are rapidly excreted from the body, and it is unknown if there is  accumulation in the male testes. Male fertility could be affected through molecular  mechanisms involving the ERs, should cells in the male testes be exposed to these  pyrethroids at physiologically relevant concentrations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xenoestrogens</field><field name="subject">estrogenic pesticides</field><field name="subject">male reproductive disorders</field><field name="subject">estrogen receptors</field><field name="subject">protein levels</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions Of Siblings Relationships In Middle Childhood And  Their Effects Of Adolescent Anxiety And Depression.</field><field name="creator">Pope, Loralee</field><field name="description">Experiencing sibling conflict is a fact of life for most children, and this study investigates  which form of sibling conflict is more likely to lead to adjustment difficulties such as  anxiety and depression.

The current thesis, however, sees reducing the willingness  of the consumer to buy such goods as crucial in reducing the market. Over three  studies, I examined variables that affected consumers buying from black markets and  their perceptions of black markets. Study 1 (80 participants) confirmed the hypothesis  that when the need to buy from a black market was for survival it would be  considered more acceptable than to save money or to buy luxury goods. Study 1  further showed it was less acceptable to buy from the black market when the victim  resulting from the purchase of the good was identified as an individual, rather than an  organisation or society. Age and the gender of the consumer were also significant  predictors of the rating of acceptability. In Study 2,65 participants completed a series  of computer simulated scenarios to measure the price they would pay for different  black market goods. Results indicate that the price participants were willing to pay for  black market goods varied according to who the victim was (individual, organisation  or society) and the participant's age and gender. Finally, in Study 3, 64 participants  completed a similar task to Study 2, but some participants were informed about the  true cost of black markets. Results confirmed the previous findings as well as  indicating that the type of crime committed to procure the good and whether they saw  information about the true cost of the markets also affected the price they would be  willing to pay.

This recognition has led to numerous reef conservation and protection activities, including the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). As in many MPAs of the world, those in the Maldives exist only as paper parks: areas protected on paper but not in practice. Despite general recognition of the importance of reef resources, insufficient funds are allocated by government to implement these parks. This situation is compounded by the absence of specific information and detailed understanding by policy makers of the true value and economic benefits of reef resources.  This thesis examines the an economic valuation of improved management of MPAs in the Maldives using Dhigali Haa, an MPA in Baa Atoll, Maldives, as a case study. A contingent valuation survey to elicit the willingness to pay of tourists visiting Baa Atoll to see improved management at the MPA was used in estimating the potential benefits. In addition, local community consultations were conducted to understand local perceptions of MPAs and their effectiveness, and to develop a feasible improved management scenario. The local consultations confirmed that Dhigali Haa was not effectively managed, leading to continued illegal use and degradation of the reef. The results of the CV survey revealed support from tourists visiting Baa Atoll to pay for improved management of Dhigali Haa. A one-off conservation fee per visit for all tourists visiting Baa Atoll was preferred over a user fee solely for divers visiting Dhigali Haa. The estimate for the mean WTP for the conservation fee was US$35&#177;5 compared to a mean WTP of US$15&#177;5 for the user fee. Comparisons between the cost of implementing improved management and the benefits gained from tourist fees showed that a conservation fee would be more beneficial than a user fee. The estimated net present value for funding the improved management via a conservation fee was US$8.65 million.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reefs</field><field name="subject">marine protected areas</field><field name="subject">economic value</field><field name="subject">contingent valuation</field><field name="subject">Maldives</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphostructural evolution of active margin basins: the example of the Hawke Bay forearc basin, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Paquet, Fabien</field><field name="description">Topography growth and sediment fluxes in active subduction margin settings are poorly understood. Geological record is often scarce or hardly accessible as a result of intensive deformation. The Hawke Bay forearc basin of the Hikurangi margin in New Zealand is well suited for studying morphstructural evolution. It is well preserved, partly emerged and affected by active tectonic deformation during Pleistocene stage for which we have well dated series and well-known climate and eustasy. The multidisciplinary approach, integrating offshore and onshore seismic interpretations, well and core data, geological mapping and sedimentological sections, results in the establishment of a detailed stratigraphic scheme for the last 1.1 Ma forearc basin fill. The stratigraphy shows a complex stack of 11 eustasy-driven depositional sequences of 20, 40 and 100 ka periodicity. These sequences are preserved in sub-basins that are bounded by active thrust structures. Each sequence is characterized by important changes of the paleoenvironment that evolves between the two extremes of the glacial maximum and the interglacial optimum. Thus, the Hawke Bay forearc domain shows segmentation in sub-basins separated by tectonic ridges during sea level lows that become submerged during sea level highs. Over 100 ka timescale, deformation along active structures together with isostasy are responsible of a progressive migration of sequence depocenters towards the arc within the sub-basins. Calculation of sediment volumes preserved for each of the 11 sequences allows the estimation of the sediment fluxes that transit throughout the forearc domain during the last 1.1 Ma. Fluxes vary from c. 3 to c. 6 Mt.a&#8315;&#185;. These long-term variations with 100 ka to 1 Ma timescale ranges are attributed to changes in the forearc domain tectonic configuration (strain rates and active structure distribution). They reflect the ability of sub-basin to retain sediments. Short-term variations of fluxes (&lt;100 ka) observed within the last 150 ka are correlated to drastic Pleistocene climate changes that modified erosion rates in the drainage area. This implies a high sensitiveness and reactivity of the upstream area to environmental changes in terms of erosion and sediment transport. Such behaviour of the drainage basin is also illustrated by the important increase of sediment fluxes since the European settlement during the 18th century and the following deforestation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en fr</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hikurangi subduction</field><field name="subject">forearc basin</field><field name="subject">stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">Pleistocene</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The immature stages of  Phaulacridium marginale (Walker)  and Sigaus campestris (Hutton)  (Orthoptera: Acrididae).</field><field name="creator">Northcroft, Margaret Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the developmental stages  of two species of grasshopper.

It can also be used to show fibre tract pathways. Both of these features were used in this thesis. Firstly, standard imaging analysis techniques were used to study the effects of mild, repetitive closed head injury on a group of professional boxers. Such data is extremely rare, so the findings of regions of brain abnormalities in the boxers are important, adding to the body of knowledge about more severe traumatic brain injury. The author developed a novel multivariate analysis technique which was used on the same data. This new technique proved to be more sensitive than the standard univariate methods commonly used. An important part of diagnosing and monitoring brain damage involves the use of biomarkers. A novel investigation of whether diffusion parameters obtained from DTI data could serve as bio-markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease was conducted. This also involved developing a multivariate approach, which displayed increased sensitivity compared with any of the component parameters used singly, and suggested these diffusion measures could be robust bio-markers of cognitive impairment. Fibre tract connectivity between regions of the brain is also a potentially valuable measure for diagnosis and monitoring brain integrity. The feasibility of this was investigated in a multi-modal MRI study. Functional MRI (fMRI) identifies regions of activation associated with a particular task. DTI can then find the pathway of the fibre bundles connecting these regions. The feasibility of using regional connectivity to interrogate brain integrity was investigated using a single healthy volunteer. Fibre pathways between regions activated and deactivated by a working memory paradigm were determined. Though the results are only preliminary, they suggest that this line of research should be continued.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diffusion tensor imaging</field><field name="subject">microstructural brain damage</field><field name="subject">mild repetitive head injury</field><field name="subject">Hotelling's T2 analysis</field><field name="subject">lineardiscriminant analysis</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">tracking cognitive decline</field><field name="subject">tractography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of defoliation on seasonal growth dynamics, the importance of internal nitrogen-recycling and the availability of soil nutrients: implications for the invasive potential of Buddleia davidii (Franch.)</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Marc Merlin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  Assessing the impact of herbivory on plant growth and reproduction is important to predict the success of biocontrol of invasive plants. Leaf area production is most important, as photosynthesis provides the foundation for all plant growth and fitness. High levels of defoliation generally reduce the productivity of plants. However, leaf area production fluctuates during the season and compensational growth may occur, which both complicate accurate estimations of defoliation impacts. Under field conditions the interaction with neighbouring species and the availability of soil nutrients need to be assessed in order to gauge long term effects of weed invasions on natural environments.  	In this thesis I have investigated seasonal leaf area dynamics in Buddleia davidii following repeated artificial defoliation, to quantify compensational leaf production and to understand the regulatory mechanisms involved. The impact of defoliation on photosynthesis, seed production, germination and nitrogen translocation patterns were analysed. Finally, possible facilitation between B. davidii and a native nitrogen fixer, Coriaria arborea, and the impact of B. davidii on soil nutrient availability were investigated. 	In defoliated B. davidii, increased node production (34%), leaf size (35%) and leaf longevity (12%) resulted in 52% greater total emergent leaf area in the short term. However, with time and diminishing tissue resources the compensation declined. No upregulation of photosynthesis was observed in pre-existing leaves. Compensational leaf area production occurred at the expense of reproduction but the germination capacity of individual seeds was unaffected. In B. davidii, nitrogen reserves are stored in old leaves. Thus, the defoliation-induced decline in tissue reserves led to changes in the remobilisation pattern and increased the importance of soil uptake but biomass production especially that of roots had declined significantly (39%). Slight facilitation effects from the neighbouring nitrogen fixer and VA-mycorrhizae were observed on B. davidii in the field, while its impact on soil chemistry during spring was negligible. 	Defoliation of B. davidii resulted in priority allocation of resources to compensational leaf growth and a concomitant reduction in flower and seed production. The compensational leaf production greatly increased the demand for nitrogen, while continued leaf removal decreased the pool of stored nitrogen. This led to changes in nitrogen remobilisation and an increased importance of root uptake. However, the significant decline in root growth will likely impair adequate nutrient uptake from the soil, which is especially important where B. davidii invades nutrient poor habitats and will increase the success of biocontrol of the species. While mycorrhizae increase nutrient accessibility for B. davidii, it is likely that the additional stress of defoliation will negate the small facilitative effects from nitrogen-fixing species like C. arborea. 	This research provides new insights into the mechanisms regulating leaf area dynamics at the shoot level and systemic physiological responses to defoliation in plants, such as nitrogen translocation. The compensation in leaf area production was considerable but only transitory and thus, the opportunity to alleviate effects of leaf loss though adjustment of light capture limited. However, to ascertain that photosynthesis at whole plant level does not increase after defoliation, more detailed measurements especially on new grown leaves are necessary. In general, defoliation had greatly reduced plant growth and performance so that an optimistic outlook for controlling this species can be given. Conclusions about the wider impacts of B. davidii on soil chemistry and community function will require further research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buddleia davidii</field><field name="subject">Defoliation</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen translocation</field><field name="subject">Species competition</field><field name="subject">VA-Mycorrhiza</field><field name="subject">Biocontrol</field><field name="subject">Leaf area</field><field name="subject">Seed production</field><field name="subject">Failure time analysis</field><field name="subject">Compensation</field><field name="subject">Photosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating debris-flow hazards on alluvial fans in the Coromandel and Kaimai regions, New Zealand, using GIS.</field><field name="creator">Welsh, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Debris-flows pose serious hazards to communities in mountainous regions of the world and are often responsible for loss of life and damages to infrastructure. Characterised by high flow velocity, large impact forces and long runout, debris-flows have potential discharges several times greater than clear water flood discharges and possess much greater erosive and destructive potential. In combination with poor temporal predictability, they present a significant hazard to settlements, transport routes and other infrastructure located at the drainage points (fan-heads) of watersheds. Thus, it is important that areas vulnerable to debris-flows are identified in order to aid decisions on appropriate land-uses for alluvial fans.  This research has developed and tested a new GIS-based procedure for identifying areas prone to debris-flow hazards in the Coromandel/Kaimai region, North Island, New Zealand. The procedure was developed using ESRI Arc View software, utilising the NZ 25 x 25 m DEM as the primary input. When run, it enabled watersheds and their associated morphometric parameters to be derived for selected streams in the study area. Two specific parameters, Melton ratio (R) and watershed length were then correlated against field evidence for debris-flows, debris-floods and fluvial processes at stream watershed locations in the study area. Overall, strong relationships were observed to exist between the evidence observed for these phenomena and the parameters, thus confirming the utility of the GIS procedure for the preliminary identification of hydrogeomorphic hazards such as debris-flow in the Coromandel/Kaimai region study area.   In consideration of the results, the procedure could prove a useful tool for regional councils and CDEM groups in regional debris-flow hazard assessment for the identification of existing developments at risk of debris-flow disaster. Furthermore, the procedure could be used to provide justification for subsequent, more intensive local investigations to fully quantify the risk to people and property at stream fan and watershed locations in such areas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Debris-flows</field><field name="subject">geomorphic hazard assessment</field><field name="subject">alluvial fans</field><field name="subject">watersheds</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">DEM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing Diabetes Self-Management: Motivational Enhancement Therapy</field><field name="creator">Britt, Eileen Frances</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), a brief four session form of Motivational Interviewing (MI), provided by diabetes health practitioners at a hospital-based clinic, in improving diabetes outcome and self-management of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes was evaluated using quasi-experimental designs (i.e., non-random control group and multiple baseline designs). Study 1 evaluated if MET provided by Diabetes Nurse Educators (DNEs) was effective in improving diabetes outcome (i.e., blood glucose and lipids) and diabetes self-management, and compared its effectiveness to the current standard treatment which comprised Patient Education (PE). Study 2 evaluated if the results of Study 1 could be generalised to Dietitians providing the intervention. Study 3 evaluated the effects of MI training and post-training supervised practice on practitioner and patient behaviour. Specific hypotheses (Studies 1-2) were that MI would lead to improved diabetes outcome through improved diabetes self-management, and would be more effective than PE. Further, training in MI plus supervised practice was predicted to lead to Nurse Educators behaving in ways consistent with MI and as a result the participants would exhibit less resistance and increased change talk than participants receiving PE (Study 3).  The results suggest that MET was well received by the participants, and contributed to improved diabetes outcome (e.g., lowered blood glucose) and diabetes self-management (e.g., self-monitoring of blood glucose and dietary compliance), and may have been more effective than PE, although high variability made conclusions uncertain. Evidence of generalisation across participants, intervention staff, and outcomes is provided. Additionally, evidence is provided that with two days training plus supervised practice the DNE were able to practice MET to at least a beginning level of competency in MI and that as a result the participants behaved in ways consistent with MI theory (i.e., showed less resistance and increased change talk).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivational interviewing</field><field name="subject">motivational enhancement</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">self-management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the Darwin-Hatherton Glacial System, Antarctica.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Nita Jane</field><field name="description">The Darwin-Hatherton glacial system is an outlet glacial system in the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica, which drains ice from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet into the Ross Ice Shelf. This research provides remotely sensed data that can be used in modeling research for the Darwin-Hatherton glacial system, which in turn can be used in mass balance research for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  Two improved digital elevation models (DEM) are produced to cover the lower Darwin Glacier and to cover the upper Darwin and Hatherton Glaciers. The new improved DEMs are generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite data, with a resolution of 45 m. To produce the two final DEMs, multiple DEMs are firstly adjusted to remove systematic errors and are then stacked and averaged to increase the accuracy and produce the final two DEMs. For the lower Darwin Glacier, 5 DEMs were averaged and in the upper Darwin and Hatherton Glaciers, 6 DEMs were averaged.  The accuracy is quantified by a remaining error of + 9 m for the lower Darwin Glacier DEM and + 37 m for the upper Darwin and Hatherton Glaciers DEM. This is a significant improvement from the existing 200 m resolution Radarsat Antarctic mapping project (RAMPv2) DEM which has a remaining error of + 138 m over the lower Darwin Glacier and + 152 m over the upper Darwin and Hatherton Glaciers. The accuracy is assessed by comparing the ASTER and RAMPv2 DEMs to highly accurate ice, cloud and land elevation satellite (ICESat) laser altimetry data.   A 15 m resolution, true colour, orthorectified image is provided for the entire Darwin-Hatherton glacial system from ASTER satellite imagery. The DEMs used to orthorectify the ASTER satellite imagery are the two new 45 m resolution ASTER DEMs.  Lastly feature tracking was explored as a method for measuring surface ice velocity. This research shows that feature tracking is unsuitable for the Darwin-Hatherton glacial system if using 15 m resolution satellite imagery over a 1 to 4 year time period.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital Elevation Model</field><field name="subject">ASTER</field><field name="subject">Darwin Glacier</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Transantarctic Mountains</field><field name="subject">Feature Tracking</field><field name="subject">Ice Velocity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invertebrate community reassembly and altered ecosystem process rates following experimental habitat restoration in a mined peat bog in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Watts, Corinne Hannah</field><field name="description">I investigated the effects ofhabitat loss and subsequent restoration on invertebrate community structure and ecosystem functioning in a mined peat bog in the North Island, New Zealand. In an experimental trial, the impact of peat bog habitat loss and isolation on the invertebrate community associated with Sporadanthus ferrugineus (Restionaceae) was investigated. Potted S. ferrugineus plants were exposed to invertebrates at various distances up to 800 m from an intact habitat (the presumed source population) over 18 weeks. Invertebrates rapidly colonised the experimental plants, with all major Orders and trophic groups present on Sc ferrugineus within 6 weeks. However. with increasing distance away from the undisturbed habitat, there was a significant decrease in total richness and abundance of invertebrates associated with the potted plants. Additional tests showed that even a moderate degree of isolation (i.e. greater than 400 m) from the intact habitat caused an almost complete failure of 'Batrachedra' sp. to colonise its host plant, at least in the short-term, The density of eggs and larvae, and the average larval size of 'Batrachedra' sp. (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae) colonising Si ferrugineus plants, as well as the proportion of Si ferrugineus stems damaged by 'Batrachedra' sp. herbivory, all decreased logarithmically with increasing distance from the intact habitat. Surprisingly, though, the rate of recovery of the insect-plant interaction following experimental habitat restoration was remarkably rapid (i.e. between 3Y2 and 6 years). After just 6 years there was no significant difference in insect-plant interactions between the intact peat bog sites and any of the experimentally restored sites up to 800 m away. These results suggest that the degree of isolation from undisturbed habitat has a major impact on the rate and patterns of restoration recovery in the invertebrate community and that some insect-plant interactions can recover rapidly from habitat loss with restoration management. Restoration of mined peat bogs in northern New Zealand is initiated by establishing a native vegetation cover to minimize further peat degradation. The effects of various restoration techniques on litter decomposition, microbial community activity and beetle community composition were investigated within an experimental trial, These treatments included translocation ofpeat bog habitat (direct transfer of islands), milled peat islands with no seed and milled peat islands with seed, and were compared with an unrestored mined site and an undisturbed peat bog. In all the response variables measured, the undisturbed peat bog sites had significantly higher decomposition rates and microbial respiration rates, and significantly higher abundance and species richness of beetles than any of the restoration treatments. Inaddition, the technique used to restore mined peatlands had a significant effect on the beetle community composition and litter decomposition processes. Despite a rapid initial change in the beetle community following habitat translocation, the direct transfer islands were still the most similar in beetle species composition to the undisturbed peat bog. Microbial activity and decomposition rates were higher in the direct transfer and mined peat surface after 6 months. However, even after 12 months, decomposition rates in the restored habitats were still far from reaching the levels recorded in the undisturbed peat bog. The results suggest that beetle community structure and ecosystem processes such as decomposition and microbial activity rates may be able to recover faster with certain restoration techniques, such as direct transfer of intact habitat islands. Subsequently, I examined long-term beetle community reassembly on islands that had been restored by creating raised areas ofprocessed peat with the addition of Leptospermum scoparium seed. Monitoring of different-aged restored islands representing the full range of restoration ages (up to 6 years) available at the peat mine, indicated that as the peat islands became older and the vegetation structure became more complex, the abundance, species richness and composition of the beetle community became increasingly similar to the community in the undisturbed peat bog. Despite this, distinct differences between the intact peat bog and older restored peat islands still persisted, even after 6 years, particularly at an individual species level. However, it is predicted that within 12 years the restored peat islands will share 100% ofbeetle species in common with the undisturbed peat bog. Taken together, these results indicate that restoration is effective in initiating the recovery of beetle assemblages and ecosystem processes (such as litter decomposition and microbial community activity) in cut-over peat bogs. However, it is estimated to take at least 12 years before pre-mining communities and functions are attained, and ongoing monitoring to develop an understanding of the longer-term dynamics of such ecosystems and processes is clearly required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peat bog</field><field name="subject">wetland</field><field name="subject">peat mining</field><field name="subject">habitat loss</field><field name="subject">peat bog restoration</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Resrionaceae</field><field name="subject">Sporadanthus ferrugineus</field><field name="subject">insect-plant interaction</field><field name="subject">predator-prey ratio</field><field name="subject">beetle community</field><field name="subject">litter decomposition</field><field name="subject">microbial community recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Pyrethroid Compounds on the Expression of Estrogen Receptors in Mouse Sertoli Cells and Implications for Male Infertility</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Jacqueline Susan</field><field name="description">Male fertility is largely controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, a careful balance between stimulating and suppressing gene expression and the secretion of hormones. The critical factors for male fertility have in the past been thought to be limited to testosterone and the gonadotropins. Estrogen has only recently been demonstrated to be both a crucial requirement for fertility and a cause of infertility. Reports in the early 1990s demonstrated a decrease in mean sperm counts over the last 50 years. A hypothesis for this observation is the increase of xenoestrogens in the environment that are able to mimic and potential disrupt the natural estrogens involvement in fertility. Although the mechanisms of estrogens involvement are not yet defined, the Sertoli cells are a potential sites of action as they possess receptors for the hormone and are able to locally produce it. Sertoli cells both act to protect and provide for the male germ cells and the developing spermatozoa. Pyrethroids are common synthetic insecticides of which some have previously shown estrogenic activity. Therefore this investigation examined the effects of pyrethoids, whose estrogenicity was confirmed via the yeast assay, on the estrogen receptor expression in mouse Sertoli cells as a model for general effects of estrogenic chemicals on male fertility. The results first confirmed the estrogenicity of some pyrethroids and these pyrethroids when exposed to mouse Sertoli cells effected estrogen receptor mRNA expression however in a different way to the natural ligand 17&#946;-estradiol.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sperm</field><field name="subject">xenoestrogens</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">male reproductive tissues</field><field name="subject">signal transduction</field><field name="subject">pyrethroids</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="subject">TM4 mouse sertoli cell culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodegradation and composting profiles of woolscour wastes</field><field name="creator">Kroening, Steven James</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the final products from the current effluent treatment system for woolscouring (wool washing) plants, namely, (i) sludge produced from the chemical flocculation of solids in the wastewater from the wash bowls, and (ii) concentrated suint (sheep sweat) produced from evaporation of the liquid phase separated from the sludge. In addition, fibrous wastes from the woolscouring process were studied. The aims of the study were to (i) investigate whether suint could be applied in a sustainable way to arable land as a potassium fertiliser, and (ii) assess the conditions under which the sludge could be composted for use as a soil conditioner to return organic matter to soil. Experiments involving suint were performed at both laboratory and glasshouse scales, while experiments involving the solid woolscour wastes were based both in the laboratory and using a small-scale (4.5 m3 total capacity) in-vessel composting unit established at a New Zealand woolscour. Decomposition was measured using net-nitrogen mineralisation and weight loss methods. Suint, the water-soluble contaminants on the fleece, contained high levels of potassium (20% on a dry weight basis) and also appreciable quantities of sulphur, sodium, and chlorine. Biological treatment before evaporation stabilised the resulting suint and improved the consistency of its composition. Suint did not affect the soil processes examined, in that it partly decomposed in soil, did not inhibit the turnover of model organic compounds, did not affect soil properties such as pH and electrical conductivity, and did not lead to increased leaching of mineral nitrogen. Suint was either neutral or positive towards plant performance when applied to soil at a rate of 100 kg potassium per hectare. Suint was therefore judged to be suitable for application to land and could be targeted to soils known to be deficient in potassium or to areas where crops with a high potassium demand are grown. Sludge, composed of dirt (soil particles, faecal matter, and skin and fibre debris) and wool grease, was highly variable in terms of its rate of decomposition, ranging from 0.8 to 27.8% of the initial total nitrogen mineralised over 30 days at 37&#8451;. Fibrous wastes, such as opener (fibre and contaminants removed from the wool by agitation prior to scouring) and scoured wool cleaner (wool fibre and dust removed from scoured and dried wool) wastes, also showed variability in decomposition rates. Sludge decomposition was improved by as much as threefold when co-incubated with fibrous wastes. Although it was shown that the polyacrylamide and pesticide content of sludge did not inhibit its decomposition, the effect of the grease content was not fully understood. Chemical properties of woolscour sludge, such as the carbon to nitrogen ratio, suggested that sludge was a substrate of good resource quality. From a biological perspective, however, the data suggested that woolscour sludge was limited in available nutrients; sludge nitrogen was derived principally from keratin, which decomposed at a low rate resulting in the slow release of mineral nitrogen and low levels of microbial activity. Thus, sludge appeared a poor substrate for composting. However, the results from composting trials indicated that the sludge could be successfully processed after blending with a bulking agent such as sawdust. The blended material showed a 90% reduction in wool grease over 21 days of composting when the moisture content of the composting mass was kept optimal. Compost temperature exceeded 55&#8451; when wool fibre was added to the blend. Initial results from a case study involving the commercial composting of the entire sludge production (16 tonnes per day) from a New Zealand woolscour indicated that a saleable compost could be produced from a material that would otherwise go to landfill, and served to illustrate the commercial significance of these research results.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Woolscouring</field><field name="subject">wastes</field><field name="subject">sludge</field><field name="subject">suint</field><field name="subject">decomposition</field><field name="subject">composting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative studies of the reproductive strategies of New Zealand grapsid crabs (Brachyura : Grapsidae) and the effects of parasites on their reproductive success</field><field name="creator">Brockerhoff, Annette Maria</field><field name="description">The reproductive strategies of four intertidal grapsid crabs, Hemigrapsus sexdentatus, H. crenulatus, Cyclograpsus lavauxi, and Helice cressa, were studied in the field and laboratory, with emphasis on mating behaviour, duration of female receptivity, and sperm competition. Mating occurred in all species during the intermoult on the days prior to oviposition, when the gonoporo opercula of females became temporarily mobile. Female Helice crassa mated up to three weeks after oviposition, but in all other species mating typically ceased at egg-laying. Male Hemigrapsus pp. used a female-centered competition strategy in which they searched for and defended receptive females until they laid eggs. In contrast, male C. lavauxi searched for and intercepted receptive females only for the duration of copulation and then pursued other receptive females (a mating system termed encounter rate competition with pure search and interception). Male Helice crassa searched for receptive females in their immediate neighbourhood and mated with them briefly on the substrate or in the burrow after which the female left (a mating system termed encounter rate competition with neighbourhoods of dominance). The mating season was short and highly synchronous for Hemigrapsus exdentatus and Cyclograpsus lavauxi and asynchronous for Hemigrapsus crenulatus and Helice crassa. In the laboratory, the mean duration of receptivity for females housed with three males varied between 4.1 and 12.4 days, and the copulation frequency of females varied before oviposition between 2.1 and 24.3 times (mean) depending on the species. Female Hemigrapsus spp. isolated from males stayed receptive significantly longer than females held continuously with males. This suggests that females are able to control the duration of their receptivity, and therefore the time available for mating, according to the absence or presence of males. The operational sex ratio (OSR) had no effect on the duration of female receptivity, but female Hemigrapsus crenulatus mated more often when several males were competing for access. Therefore, male-male competition increased the number of matings per female and hence sperm competition within the female spermathecae. Larger males mated significantly more often than smaller males in all species. However, male size did not affect ejaculate size, meaning that small and large males transferred similar-sized ejaculates, e.g., in Hemigrapsus spp. Males of the two Hemigrapsus species followed a different strategy of sperm allocation. Male H. crenulatus, which are typically confronted with a high mating frequency of the female and a long, asynchronous mating season, distributed similar-sized ejaculates, irrespective of female size. By contrast, male H. sexdentatus, which experience a comparatively lower risk of sperm competition during a short, synchronised mating season, invested larger ejaculates for larger females than for smaller females. In addition, the size of the first and second ejaculates transferred to a female by a male H. crenulatus were not significantly different, whereas the first was larger than the second for H. sexdentatus. A parasitological survey was undertaken of the four grapsid crabs and the presence, seasonal variation and relationship with host gender and size of parasites determined. Four internal parasites were discovered: Nectonema zealandica n. Sp. (Nematomorpha: Nectonematoidea), portunion sp. (Isopoda: Entoniscidae), Profilicollis novaezelandensis n. sp. and profilicollis antarcticus (Acanthocephala: P olymorphidae). Portunion sp. castrated its female hosts, but not the males thereby creating a more male-biased sex ratio. Males parasitised with portunion sp. were equally successful during male-male competition and the number of matings they achieved. The above findings are important for our current understanding of mating strategies in Grapsidae, which are more diverse than previously thought. Females with a restricted duration of sexual receptivity have some control over their receptive period and can therefore influence the OSR and the extent of male-male competition. As females mated multiple times during their receptive period, sperm competition is a common feature in Grapsidae. However, males employed different tactics in regards to sperm competition such as longer mating duration (e.g., C. lavauxi), high number of matings (Helice crassa), or post-copulatory mate guarding until oviposition (Hemigrapsus spp.).</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crabs</field><field name="subject">crustacea</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">Hemigrapsus</field><field name="subject">Cyclograpsus</field><field name="subject">Helice</field><field name="subject">mate guarding</field><field name="subject">copulation</field><field name="subject">mating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Wanganui-Wilberg rock avalanche: deposit, dynamics and dating</field><field name="creator">Chevalier, Guillaume</field><field name="description">The Wanganui-Wilberg landslide lies between Hokitika and Franz Josef townships, at the entrance of Harihari, on the true left bank of the Wanganui River, by State Highway 6. This apparently co-seismic landslide belongs to the class of events called rock avalanches - powerful destructive agents (Keefer, 1984) in the landscape. Other rock avalanches are numerous (Whitehouse, 1983), and widespread over the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and many appear to be co-seismic. De Mets et al. (1994) used the model NUVEL-1A to characterize the motion of the Alpine fault: 37 mm/year at an azimuth of 071&#176; for the strike-slip and a dip-slip of 10 mm/year normal to the strike direction. Although linear when seen from the sky, the detailed morphology of the fault is more complex, called en &#233;chelon (Norris and Cooper, 1997). It exhibits metamorphosed schists (mylonite series) in its hanging wall (McCahon, 2007; Korup, 2004). Earthquakes on the Alpine fault have a recurrence time of c. 200-300 years and a probability of occurrence within 100 years of 88% (Rhoades and Van Dissen, 2002). Thought to have been triggered by the AD1220 event (determined by dendrochronology), the Wanganui-Wilberg rock avalanche deposit represents only 20% of its original volume, which was c. 33 million cubic metres. The deposit probably dammed the Wanganui River and, as a result, created a small and short-lived lake upstream. The next earthquake capable of triggering such events is likely to occur fairly soon (Yetton, 1998). Knowledge of historic catastrophic events such as the Wanganui-Wilberg rock avalanche is of crucial importance in the development of future hazard and management plans.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">co-seismic rock avalanche</field><field name="subject">Alpine fault</field><field name="subject">ground-penetrating radar</field><field name="subject">dendrochronology</field><field name="subject">deposit erosion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dosimetric Investigation of Electron Arc Therapy Delivered Using Siemens Electron Arc Applicator with a Trapezoidal Aperture</field><field name="creator">Xing, Aitang</field><field name="description">This study investigated the delivery of electron arc treatment with a trapezoidal aperture. The aim of the investigation is to reduce the nonuniformity of the dose distribution, which is caused by the variation of the patient contour from superior to inferior. The characteristics of static electron beam were first investigated. Then a measurement-based algorithm was developed  and implemented as a computer program called EarcMU to calculate the monitor units required for delivering  the prescribed dose with a trapezoidal aperture. The central axis percentage depth dose was found to be independent of source-to-surface distance (SSD) and the width of the aperture. The inplane profiles of a trapezoidal aperture show that the dose decreases longitudinally from the wide to the narrow end of the trapezoidal aperture. The EarcMU program was verified using two cylindrical water phantoms. The measured dose and the dose calculated by the program agreed within 2.1% in the typical clinical conditions. A simple method was also proposed for determining the trapezoidal aperture for an individual patient. Under the same conditions, the trapezoidal apertures calculated by this method along with the open aperture were used to deliver treatments to several conical phantoms. Significant improvement in the uniformity of dose distribution was observed.  On average, the flatness index of the longitudinal dose distribution from superior to inferior decreases dramatically from 8% for open aperture down to 0.58% for trapezoidal aperture. The results are clinically significant, indicating that delivering the electron arc treatment using a trapezoidal aperture can bring more uniform dose to the patient regardless of the change of patient contour from superior to inferior.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron arc therapy</field><field name="subject">dose per degree</field><field name="subject">monitor unit</field><field name="subject">electron arc applicator</field><field name="subject">trapezoidal aperture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deciphering the mtDNA record of prehistoric population movements in Oceania</field><field name="creator">Pierson, Melanie Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis uses mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogenies to explore patterns of past human mobility in Oceania. To extend the current knowledge of mtDNA variation in Oceania, 20 entire mt genomes were sequenced and analysed in a data set of more than 144 sequences from Australia, Oceania, Island Southeast Asia and Taiwan. The MinMax Squeeze method enabled this large data set to be analysed with an optimality criterion (Pierson et al. 2006). The analysis revealed two major groups of haplogroups in Oceania, distinguished by the relationships to others outside of the region: an 'ancient' set of types whose phylogenies and distributions suggest they are descended from the Pleistocene-era settlers of Near Oceania, and a second 'young' group whose presence in Oceanic populations may reflect more recent movements into Near Oceania. The detailed phylogenies of these haplogroups presented here will aid in future investigations of human mtDNA in Oceania, allowing samples to be screened by defining mutations to target haplogroups of interest. A large data set of global entire human mt DNA sequences was assembled from public data bases and tested for evidence of selection and recombination. These tests, and phylogenetic analyses of random subsets of the data set, found high levels of homoplasy in the sequences. Homoplasy in the control region of the mtDNA molecule was examined in particular, resulting in a relative scale of mutability at each position of the ~1kb sequence. Subsequent phylogenetic tests of weighting schemes derived from this analysis for the control hypervariable region I (HVR-I) did not show demonstrable improvements over the unweighted examples, but did highlight instances in which the HVR-I sequence failed to predict the more robust trees generated by the coding region. Finally, the HVR-I and diagnostic SNPs were sequenced in a set of 46 Polynesian samples from Auckland, and this data was analysed within a large set of HVR-I sequences (more than 4000) from Oceanic, Asian and the American populations available from public data bases. These analyses were informed by the whole mtDNA phylogenies generated earlier in the project, and add population level data to the emerging picture of prehistoric female mobility gained from entire mtDNA analyses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oceania</field><field name="subject">prehistory</field><field name="subject">mtDNA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basin Analysis of the Porter Group, Castle Hill Basin, Canterbury: Implications for Oligocene Tectonics in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Congdon, Linda Marie</field><field name="description">A basin analysis of the Oligocene Porter Group rocks in Castle Hill Basin, Canterbury, was completed. The Porter Group contains the Coleridge Formation which comprises a lower sandstone unit and an upper micritic limestone unit, and the Thomas Formation which consists of biosparite limestone and interbedded tuffs. Basin analysis provided evidence that the Coleridge Formation lower sandstone unit was deposited in an inner shelf setting based upon its moderate sorting, large grain size range, laterally continuous geometry and lack of bedforms due to intense bioturbation. The upper micritic limestone is a mid shelf deposit composed of micrite and minor clastic grains. Provenance analysis has classified the lower sandstone unit as a quartz arenite. Both metamorphic and plutonic source areas are likely for the sandstone, along with reworked grains from underlying Formations based on QFL, SEM-CL, heavy mineral and glauconite analysis. The Thomas Formation limestone is a typical New Zealand cool water biosparite deposited on the inner shelf as a result of storms and debris flows, with the upper cross-bedded limestone lithofacies being reworked by currents in shallow water. Petrographic data showing multiple stages of diagenesis at the upper contact of the Thomas Formation provides evidence for a major tectonic event. The interbedded tuffs are a result of basaltic marine volcanism on the inner to mid shelf. The tuffs are reworked and deposited by turbidity current, debris flow and storms. Analysis of a dike within the Thomas Formation volcanics showed a weakly alkaline geochemical signature that is indicative of volcanism related to extension. A regional synthesis compared the Porter Group rocks in Castle Hill Basin with Oligocene rocks in North Canterbury, West Coast and North Otago. Oligocene quartz-rich sandstones are found in Castle Hill Basin, Harper Valley, Avoca and Culverden while micritic limestone is found on the East Coast from Marlborough to Otago. Oligocene basaltic volcanics interbedded with limestone and karst unconformities are found in Castle Hill Basin, Culverden and Otago. Normal faulting may be responsible for thickness variations and several regional karst unconformities in the eastern South Island. Plate reconstructions based on sea floor magnetic anomalies also suggests the New Zealand region was tectonically active during the Oligocene. Mounting evidence, including Eocene-Oligocene faulting and volcanism in the South Island, suggests that New Zealand may not be best described as a passive margin during the Early-Mid Tertiary.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Basin analysis</field><field name="subject">Oligocene rocks</field><field name="subject">tectonics</field><field name="subject">Porter Group</field><field name="subject">sandstone</field><field name="subject">biosparite limestone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geographic variation in behaviour and dim light adaptation in Cyrba algerina (Araneae, Salticidae)</field><field name="creator">Cerveira, Ana M.</field><field name="description">Cyrba algerina is a salticid (Salticidae) spider that lives on the undersides of stones. Two populations were studied, Sintra and Algarve (Portugal), and shown to have similar phenology but different dominant prey. Life cycle in the laboratory was similar for the two populations, but Sintra matured at larger size than Algarve individuals, with these differences potentially having a genetic basis. Sintra individuals used prey-specific prey-capture behaviour against allopatric (Oecobius amboseli) and sympatric (O. machadoi, Trachyzelotes bardiae) spider and insect (bristletails) species. In contrast, Algarve C. algerina only adopted specialised capture behaviour against bristletails. Sintra, but not Algarve, individuals responded to the odour of O. machadoi and T. bardiae, and showed preference for T. bardiae over O. machadoi. Interpopulation variation in the use of specific prey-capture behaviour and in sensitivity to odour cues from prey is directly related to the prey available to individuals from each population, suggesting local adaptation to local prey. Preference for oecobiids seems to be controlled by an experiencetriggered developmental switch. The optics and histology of C. algerina&#8217;s principal eye suggest that living in a microhabitat with dim ambient light has favoured sensitivity at the expense of spatial acuity. Short focal length, reduced power of the eye&#8217;s diverging lens, and wide, contiguous rhabdomeres, seem to minimise the visual constraints imposed by the low light levels in C. algerina&#8217;s microhabitat. While relying solely on vision, C. algerina can detect, identify and capture prey in dim-light conditions under which other salticids perform poorly. C. algerina&#8217;s behaviour suggest use of temporal summation to improve its visual performance in dim light.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spider</field><field name="subject">Salticidae</field><field name="subject">Cyrba</field><field name="subject">predation</field><field name="subject">interpopulation variation</field><field name="subject">phenotypic plasticity</field><field name="subject">optics</field><field name="subject">dim light adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of anxiety and communication apprehension in preschool children who stutter</field><field name="creator">Phaal, Bianca</field><field name="description">People who stutter (PWS) tend to have increased levels of anxiety compared to people who do not stutter (PWNS), particularly in social situations (Messenger, Onslow, Packman, &amp; Menzies, 2004).

The present study sought to examine generalized anxiety and communication apprehension in preschool CWS.  Seven CWS aged between 3;3 and 4;11 years, and seven sex and age-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS) provided salivary cortisol samples at three distinct sampling times across a one-week period.  They additionally provided a conversational speech sample, and were administered the Communication Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten Children Who Stutter (Vanryckeghem &amp; Brutten, 2007).  Parents were required to complete the Preschool Anxiety Scale (Spence &amp; Rapee, 1999) to provide estimates of their child's anxiety level.  Results revealed no significant differences between CWS and CWNS in generalized anxiety or communication apprehension.  No relationships were found between stuttering severity and generalized anxiety or communication apprehension either.

This concern has inevitably coincided with increasing research efforts. The majority of this research has focused on men who batter female partners. Attempted explanations for this problem have arisen from general theories of aggression as well as research identifying the unique characteristics of domestically violent men. This study proposed a new direction for domestic violence research, considering domestic violence as a process. The application of such a conceptualisation was intended to capture both the dynamic and complex nature of these events. A qualitative methodology based on Grounded Theory was used to delineate a descriptive model of the offence process in domestic violence from interviews with ten participants currently incarcerated at Paparua Prison, Christchurch. These men had current or prior convictions for domestic violence offences. The model that emerged from this study consists of four temporally sequential phases which are described and discussed. These consist of: background factors, buildup/ offence context phase, offence phase and post-offence phase. It is suggested that this offence process model will provide a framework for the evaluation of current causal explanations, has the potential to enhance the development ofnew hypotheses and has utility in terms of alterring current conceptualisations of effective intervention packages.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic violence</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of algal assemblages across a gradient of acid mine drainage stress on the West Coast, South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bray, Jonathan Peter</field><field name="description">Physicochemical factors, algal diversity, taxonomic composition and standing crop were investigated across a broad gradient of AMD stress in streams and rivers. 52 sites were surveyed in the vicinity of Greymouth, Reefton, Westport and Blackball, on the West Coast, South Island. Seven sites in the Reefton area were sampled from April 2006 - February 2007 to establish changes over time in benthic algal communities of AMD and reference streams. Longitudinal change and ecosystem recovery were also investigated by sampling eight sites down Devils Creek, Reefton, and two of its tributaries. AMD has negative impacts on algal diversity, generally increases the dominance of certain taxa and, where metal oxide deposition or hydraulic disturbance are not great, can lead to algal proliferations. These proliferations were chlorophyte dominated, predominantly by filamentous Klebsormidium acidophilum. From the general survey a total of 15 taxa were identified from the most severely impacted sites (pH &lt;3.6), which included both acidophiles and acidotolerant algae. Multivariate analyses strongly suggest that pH was the dominant factor controlling taxonomic occurrence of diatoms, macroalgae and the structure of the total assemblage. Other factors such as conductivity, metal oxide deposition, temperature, depth, month, geographic location and altitude were also important. Algal communities changed over time and this became more marked as AMD impact decreased. This was presumably due to AMD stressors reducing diversity, and thus the available scope for assemblage change. Longitudinal differences in assemblage structure within Devils Creek appeared to be in response to dilution of AMD in upper reaches and to changes in natural physical features such as gradient in mid and lower reaches. After a distance of 7.2 km the physicochemical effects of AMD and suspended clay inputs were minimal. At this site and at several previous sites, the assemblage exhibited a degree of recovery towards that found at unimpacted sites. A range of algae found in the broad scale-survey are potentially useful 'sensitive' indicators. These included: Heteroleibleinia purpurascens; Achnanthes oblongella; Oedogonium sp. and Spirogyra sp.

The action of endo-&#946;-mannanase in barley, its optimum temperature and pH for action, temporal and spatial localization, activity in the presence of hormones and sugars and its effect on the seed's mechanical strength were assayed. The development of a spectrophotometric assay for endo-&#946;-mannanase detection was also trialed. 	The optimum temperature and pH for these experiments were found to be 37&#8451; and pH 7. Using these parameters, the endo-&#946;-mannanase enzyme was found to be initially localized in the seed coat and moved through to the endosperm over time. The detected level of enzyme activity increased in the presence of gibberellic acid and glucose, or decreased when abscisic acid was added. Similar results were seen when the embryo was removed and the endosperm and seed coat were incubated in hormone- and sugar-containing media. The presence of exogenous endo-&#946;-mannanase did not affect the mechanical strength of the seed but there was a strong correlation between increasing endo-&#946;-mannanase activity and decreasing mechanical strength over time. The spectrophotometric assay for quantifying endo-&#946;-mannanase in extracts showed promise but did not reach fruition due to unexplained sources of variation. The localization and regulation of endo-&#946;-mannanase in barley were similar to those seen in other plants, such as tomato, lettuce and coffee. These findings have biotechnological applications within the brewery industry. By increasing the mobilization of reserves such as mannan, it is thought that the seedling can utilize this secondary carbohydrate source instead of, or at least supplementing, glucose which was mobilized from starch. This will theoretically reduce the starch and glucose lost during the malting period leaving a higher sugar content free for fermentation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endo-&#946;-mannanase</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">malting</field><field name="subject">biotechnology</field><field name="subject">endohydrolase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Assessment of Trampling Impact on Alpine Vegetation, Fiordland and Mount Aspiring National Parks, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Squires, Carolyn</field><field name="description">The objectives of this study were two fold. The first was to quantify the nature and extent of current levels of human impact in alpine areas at four sites within Fiordland and Mount Aspiring National Parks along walking tracks at Key Summit, Gertrude Saddle, Borland Saddle and Sugarloaf Pass. In order to do so, a survey was carried out with transects placed perpendicular to the track, and distributed among different vegetation types. In each transect, plant structural and compositional aspects, and soil and environmental parameters were measured. Transects were divided into track, transition, undisturbed and control zones, and changes to dependent variables were compared with distance from the track centre. Damage from visitor impact was largely restricted to within 1m from the track centre. The most significant impacts were to structural aspects of plant and soil properties with significant reductions in plant height, total vegetation cover and bryophyte cover, and increases in bareground and erosion on tracks. Erosion was more prevalent on slopes greater than 25&#176;, while tracks on peat soils contained greater bareground exposure, particularly of organic soil. The second study objective was to investigate the relationship between specific levels of impact and the resulting damage to two key alpine vegetation types, tussock herb field and cushion bog. This was undertaken by carrying out controlled trampling experiments, measuring changes to plant structural and compositional aspects four weeks and one year after treatment. Both vegetation types saw dramatic reductions in total vegetation cover and height immediately after trampling, however overall composition and species richness varied little. These two alpine vegetation types showed moderate-low resistance to initial impact and low resilience, with very little recovery evident one year later. Research intothese two areas is important for managing visitor use within alpine areas in order to meet conservation and recreation goals. The survey indicates that alpine community types are very sensitive to visitor use, showing significant structural damage, however the spatial extent of impact is limited within the broader landscape. Instead, visitor impacts associated with tracks are likely to be more visually and aesthetically significant, influencing the visitor experience. The trampling experiments indicate that use levels over 25-75 passes per year within tussock herbfield and cushion bog vegetation on peat soils will result in ongoing damage to previously undisturbed sites. Methods for minimising impacts include limiting visitor numbers, public education in low impact practices, redirection of tracks and use to areas that are less sensitive, the dispersal of visitor activity at very low use intensities (less than 75 direct passes per year) and the concentration of activity on tracks above this level.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trampling</field><field name="subject">alpine vegetation</field><field name="subject">visitor impact</field><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">recreation impacts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aggregation and development of the gorse spider mite Tetranychus lintearius dufour (acari: tetranychidae)</field><field name="creator">Millar, Gavin Francis</field><field name="description">Gorse, Ulex europaeus, is a serious weed of agriculture and forestry in New Zealand. The mite Tetranychus lintearius feeds on gorse in Europe and was released in New Zealand during autumn 1989 as a potential biological control agent. The aim of my laboratory study was to increase available knowledge on its development and aggregation. As the quality of gorse declined as a food resource (as indicated by chlorophyll content) a significant decline in egg production, and an increase in development time of mites was found. Mean egg production at 15&#8451; ranged from 37.8 to 45.2 eggs/female over 10 days in the experimental treatments and development time from 39.2 to 43.3 days. Density of adult female mites (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20/spine) also had a significant effect on the number of eggs produced/female over ten days (mean daily egg production/female, 0.78-0.88). Mean development time from egg to adult decreased from 40.6 to 39 days as density increased from 1 to 50 mites/spine. The resident New Zealand strain of T lintearius, imported originally from Cornwall, is now widely established but has not established successfully on the west coast of the South Island or in the north of the North Island. Four new strains recently introduced from coastal Portugal and Spain, areas climatically similar to these New Zealand regions, may be more successful. Thus, although egg production and survival of all strains were significantly reduced when subjected to daily periods of simulated rainfall in laboratory experiments, those of the newly introduced strains were least affected. Laboratory experiments with the resident New Zealand and Cambados strains also showed that individuals aggregated actively at 10-20&#8451;, but the latter aggregated more strongly at these temperatures. This strong aggregation behaviour may increase survival in warm, wet climates and suggests that Cambados strain mites could become established and so increase gorse control in Westland and Northland.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gorse</field><field name="subject">spider mite</field><field name="subject">Tetranychus lintearius</field><field name="subject">aggregation</field><field name="subject">fecundity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Actinomycetes and fungi associated with marine invertebrates: a potential source of bioactive compounds</field><field name="creator">Mahyudin, Nor Ainy</field><field name="description">Actinomycetes and fungi were successfully isolated from both New Zealand and Malaysian marine invertebrates and classified as facultatively marine based on their ability to grow on both sea water and non-sea water media. Most of the extracts obtained from selected isolates were cytotoxic. A clear preference of the actinomycetes for solid-state fermentation was observed, however, for fungi no significant preference was seen. Three isolates of Streptomyces spp., four Penicillium spp. and two Paecilomyces spp. whose extracts showed good cytotoxicity were selected for further investigation.  A small-scale extract obtained from a solid culture of Streptomyces sp. (LA3L2) showed good cytotoxicity and a new cytotoxic metabolite was isolated from a large-scale extract of Streptomyces sp. (LA3L2). This metabolite was characterized as S-methyl 2,4-dihydroxy-6-isopropyl-3,5-dimethylbenzothioate (5.15) and is only the third compound reported to contain the S-methyl benzothioate group. Two known compounds, montagnetol (5.16) and erythrin (5.18), were isolated from a further large-scale cultivation of Streptomyces sp. (LA3L2) and is the first reported actinomycete to produce these lichen-related compounds. In addition, two known inactive metabolites (bohemamine (5.1) and bohemamine B (5.2)) were identified from the small-scale extract. Streptomyces sp. (LA3L2) was also investigated for the effect of temperature and salinity on growth and cytotoxicity and shown to produce bohemamine only at 20 - 28&#8451; and 4% sea salt concentration on solid media. This isolate gave a low yield of active metabolite under all conditions.  Small-scale extracts of two other Streptomyces spp. yielded three known cytotoxic metabolites. These were thiazostatin B (7.14) from Streptomyces sp. (LA5L4) and chromomycin A2 (7.1), chromomycin A3 (7.2) and chromomycin 02-3D (7.3) from Streptomyces sp. (LA3L1).     All four Penicillium spp. produced known metabolites. Penicillium sp. (LY1L5) yielded two known metabolites, cycloaspeptide A (7.4) and &#945;-cyclopiazonic acid (7.5). &#945;-Cyclopiazonic acid (7.5) and three other known metabolites (roquefortine A (7.6), cyclopeptin (7.7) and viridicatin (7.8)) were isolated from Penicillum sp. (KK3T23). Penicillium sp. (KK3T8) produced brefeldin A (7.10), while mycophenolic acid (7.12) and brevianamide A (7.11) were produced by Penicillium sp. (KK4T14b).  The effect of salinity on growth and cytotoxicity was investigated for the two Penicillium isolates producing the cytotoxic metabolite, &#945;-cyclopiazonic acid (7.5). Saline conditions were not required for growth but metabolite production differed between the two isolates with respect to salinity. Isolate LY1L5 required saline conditions for &#945;-cyclopiazonic production whereas isolate KK3T23 produced the metabolite under non-saline conditions and in concentrations of sea salt up to 6%.  Three known compounds, indole-3-carboxylic acid (7.15), indole-3-carboxylate (7.17) and 5-carboxymellein (7.16) were identified from Paecilomyces sp. (PR5L9). Investigation of a small-scale extract obtained from a solid culture of another Paecilomyces sp. (PR10T2) resulted in the isolation and characterization of a unique structure of a symmetrical cyclic depsipeptide, epi-angolide (NAM 6-1). NAM 6-1 was considered as a new compound based on four homoisomeric configurations (A1, A2, A3 and A4).                  The value of dereplication procedures with respect to the rapid identification of metabolites and enhancement of in-house metabolite libraries is discussed. Structural elucidation of nine known metabolites (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.10 and 7.11) was greatly aided by the in-house dereplication techniques using LC-MS-UV and AntiMarin database.  A significant advantage was gained by the use of the CapNMR which enabled NMR characterization of very small quantities of metabolites (&lt;20 &#181;g). Approximately &lt;5 &#181;g of materials were required to perform 1D proton NMR experiments for the dereplication of seven known compounds; bohemamine (5.1), bohemamine B (5.2), thiazostatin B (7.14), indole-3-carboxylate (7.17) and 5-carboxymellein (7.16).  Approximately 20 &#181;g of materials were needed to acquire 1D and 2D (HSQC, HMBC and NOE) NMR spectra for structural elucidation of the new metabolite, S-methyl 2,4-dihydroxy-6-isopropyl-3,5-dimethylbenzothioate (5.15). Some 8 &#181;g of materials were sufficient to perform 1D and 2D (COSY, HSQC and HMBC) NMR experiments for complete structural characterization of two known metabolites, montagnetol (5.16) and erythrin (5.18). Approximately 10 &#181;g of materials were needed to acquire 1D and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC and HMBC) experiments for structural elucidation of the new compound, epi-angolide NAM 6-1 (A1, A2, A3 and A4).   Rapid identification of known fungal metabolites enabled the in-house HPLC-UV/Rt library to be enhanced by eight metabolites (7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.10, 7.11, 7.17 and 7.16). An HPLC-UV/Rt library for actinomycete metabolites was successfully established with the insertion of eight known metabolites (5.1, 5.2, 5.16, 5.18, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.14).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine-derived actinomycetes</field><field name="subject">marine-derived fungi</field><field name="subject">Streptomyces sp.</field><field name="subject">effect of salinity</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">cytotoxicity</field><field name="subject">CapNMR</field><field name="subject">dereplication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provenance Analysis of the Sperm Bluff Formation, southern Victoria Land,  Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Savage, Jeni Ellen</field><field name="description">Beacon Supergroup rocks of probable Devonian age, containing conglomerate clasts of lithologies unknown in outcrop in southern Victoria Land (SVL) occur in the St Johns Range to Bull Pass Region, SVL, Antarctica. The Lower Taylor Group sedimentary rocks, herein called the Sperm Bluff Formation, unconformably rest on the regionally extensive Kukri Erosion Surface that truncates local basement. The basement complex includes three Plutonic Suites, Dry Valley (DV) 1a, DVIb and DV2 of the Granite Harbour Intrusives that intrude metasedimentary rocks of the Koettlitz Group. Allibone et al. (1993b) suggested a SVL terrane accretion event may have occurred about the same time as accretion of a terrane known as the Bowers terrane in northern Victoria Land (NVL) based on changing chemistry of the CambroOrdovician granitoids. Further, it is suggested that conglomerate clasts of the Sperm Bluff Formation may have been derived from this postulated terrane (Allibone et al., 1993b; and Turnbull et al., 1994). Following extensive fieldwork provenance studies and basin analysis of the sedimentary Sperm Bluff Formation are used here to test these ideas. The Sperm Bluff Conglomerate of Turnbull et al. (1994) is re-interpreted as the Sperm Bluff Formation and described using a lithofacies-based approach. The Sperm Bluff Formation is divided into six lithofacies including 1) Conglomerate Lithofacies; 2) Pebbly Sandstone Lithofacies; 3) Crossbedded Sandstone Lithofacies; 4) Parallelbedded Lithofacies; 5) Low-angle Crossbedded Lithofacies; and 6) Interbedded Siltstone/Sandstone Lithofacies. The intimate field association of the Conglomerate, Pebbly Sandstone and Crossbedded Sandstone Lithofacies ties them to the Conglomerate Lithofacies Association whereas the other three units are independent. The Conglomerate Lithofacies Association is interpreted to represent a wavedominated deltaic environment, based on the presence of broad channels, pervasive crossbedding, paleocurrent and trace fossil data. Both Parallel-bedded and Low-angle Crossbedded Sandstone Lithofacies are interpreted as a foreshore-shore face shallow marine setting on the basis of low-angle crossbeds and trace fossil assemblages. The Interbedded Siltstone and Sandstone Lithofacies is interpreted as an estuarine environment based on alternating siltstone/sandstone beds and the presence of flaser and lenticular bedding, small crossbedded dune sets, mud drapes, syneresis cracks and diverse paleocurrent directions. An estuarine setting is tentatively favoured over a lagoonal setting due to the presence of syneresis cracks small channels and the proximity to a river delta. I suggest that the Sperm Bluff Formation is likely a lateral correlative of the Altar Mt Formation of the Middle Taylor Group, in particular the Odin Arkose Member. This interpretation is based on arkosic nature of the sedimentary rocks, regional paleocurrent patterns, the presence of salmon pink grits at Gargoyle Turrets and trace fossil assemblages. The upper most lithofacies at Mt Suess, the Low-angle Crossbedded Sandstone Lithofacies that only occurs at this site is- suggested as a lateral correlative to the Arena Sandstone, which stratigraphically overlies the Altar Mt Formation, based on quartzose composition, clay matrix, stratigraphic position and trace fossils present. Provenance analysis was carried out on sedimentary rocks and conglomerate clasts using clasts counts of conglomerates, petrographic analysis of clasts, point counts of sandstones and clasts, geochemistry and V-Pb detrital zircon analysis. Conglomerate clasts lithologies include dominantly silicic igneous clasts and finely crystalline quartzite clast amongst other subordinate lithologies such as vein quartz, schist, schorl rock, gneiss and sandstone. Despite past identification of granitoid clasts in the Sperm Bluff Formation (Turnbull et al., 1994), none were found. Rhyolitic clasts of the Sperm Bluff Formation have compositions typical of highly evolved subduction related rocks, although they have undergone post-emplacement silicification. Wysoczanski et al. (2003) date rhyolite and tuff clasts between 497&#177;17 Ma and 492&#177;8 Ma, placing them within error of all three Dry Valley Magmatic Suites and removing the likelihood of correlation to NVL volcanic rocks. Petrographic analysis suggests they are components of a silicic magmatic complex. Chemically the volcanic clasts appear to represent a single magmatic suite (Sperm Bluff Clast Suite), and are clearly related to the Dry Valley Plutonic Suites. Although clasts are not constrained beyond doubt to one Suite, DV2 is the best match. Quartzite clasts of the Sperm Bluff Formation are too pure and old to be derived from a local source. Detrital zircon V-Pb ages for the quartzite suggest zircons were derived from the East Antarctic Craton, and that the quartzite source rocks were deposited prior to the Ross-Delamarian Orogeny. Quartzite with a similar age signature has not been identified; however, the Junction Formation sandstone of northwest Nelson has a similar age spectrum. Sandstones from the Sperm Bluff Formation indicate derivation from a felsic continental block provenance, which contain elements of volcanic, hyperbyssal and plutonic rocks. They are arkosic to quartzose in composition and conspicuously lack plagioclase. Detrital zircon analyses give a strong 500 Ma peak in all 3 samples, characteristic of a Ross-Delamarian Orogen source, with few other peaks. The dominance of a single peak is highly suggestive oflocal derivation. The sedimentary rocks of the Sperm Bluff Formation are interpreted to be derived predominantly from the basement rocks they now overlie. The presence of the regionally extensive Kukri Erosion Surface at the lower contact of the Beacon Supergroup rocks implies an intermediate source must have existed. This most likely contained all components of the formation. I suggest that the DV2 Suite was emplaced in a subsiding, extensional intra-arc setting. Erosion of the uplifted arc region probably occurred from Late Ordovician to Silurian times with deposition of sediments in a subsiding intra-arc basin. Erosion of the rhyolitic complex in this region probably occurred, however, it is likely that some was preserved. Inversion of this basin prior to the Devonian probably provided the means for these sediments to be deposited as the Sperm Bluff Fonnation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Provenance</field><field name="subject">geochronology</field><field name="subject">depositional setting</field><field name="subject">southern Victoria Land</field><field name="subject">sedimentary rocks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Close Look at the Nomology of Support for National Smoking Bans amongst Hospitality Industry Managers:  An application of Growth Mixture Modeling</field><field name="creator">Guenole, Nigel Raymond</field><field name="description">Politicians and social marketers considering whether, and how, to implement a national smoking ban in their countries require sound evidence regarding what the causes of support are amongst key stakeholders, how this support will develop over the short to medium term in which they seek to be re-elected, and how support relates to critical outcomes like enforcement.  In response to this need, I use structural equation models to develop a model of the antecedents of support, based on theories of self interest and common sense justice, amongst hospitality industry managers.  I show that support is determined more by fairness related constructs than self interest constructs, that support for national smoking bans increases consistently over time, and that the initial level of support, and the rate at which support increases, is positively related to subsequent enforcement behaviour by bar managers, in the year after implementation of such a ban, in New Zealand.  I use growth mixture modeling to identify two subgroups of bar managers whose support changes at different rates.  First, a class of bar managers with a high proportion of smokers who reported fewer instances of respiratory related health problems, showed low initial support, and whose support for the legislation slowly decreased.   And second, a class of bar managers comprised of fewer smokers, but reporting more instances of respiratory related health problems.  This class began with a high degree support, and steadily increased in support for the national smoking ban.  I discuss the implications of these findings for social marketers, health educationalists, and politicians interested in introducing a similar ban in other countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">self-interest</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">smoking ban</field><field name="subject">SEM</field><field name="subject">mixture modeling</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can happiness be taught?

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether happiness can be taught through an intervention programme aimed at increasing levels of subjective wellbeing as measured by scales of self-reported happiness and depression.  Participants attending a course based on research into Positive Psychology that included the practice of multiple validated interventions made up the experimental group (N=33), and participants in other community education courses made up the control group (N=41). A pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up design was used, with participants completing sets of questionnaires designed to test levels of happiness and depression, and additional questionnaires capturing demographic information and signature character strengths. The results of this study suggested that the intervention had a positive effect on increasing happiness and reducing symptoms of depression. The non-randomised groups resulted in a more depressed experimental than control group prior to the intervention. Generally speaking, it was not true that any subgroup benefited more from the intervention than others, nor were happier or more depressed than others. This study appears to support earlier research that found that subjective wellbeing could be increased through education and volitional behaviour.

Generally, this method has been efficient in that it permitted emitters to decide how to minimise and mitigate impacts. However, to address the inconsistencies in air quality management across New Zealand born of this approach, and to permit measures designed to improve the working of the Resource Management Act (RMA), National Environmental Standards for Ambient Air Quality have been developed and implemented to establish consistent regulation and protection for all New Zealanders. The standards were gazetted in September 2004, for full implementation by 2013.  This thesis explores the implementation of the National Environmental Standards for Ambient Air Quality, examining the philosophy behind the standards and associated strategies for dealing with air pollution management in New Zealand, and the international context for the development of appropriate tools to address air quality concerns. The research also provides an independent dispersion modelling assessment of the application of the Ministry for the Environment's initiative regarding sulphur dioxide in the Marsden Point airshed, Northland, utilising The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) for a period when heightened concentration values had been recorded.   The key outcomes of the thesis are: (i) 99.9th percentile and maximum values for the simulated two-day modelling case study are within those stipulated by the air quality standards for sulphur dioxide; (ii) modelled concentrations associated with shipping within the airshed of interest contribute significantly to total modelled values; (iii) the chief obstruction to increased use of the prognostic modelling approach is that of the unsatisfactory availability and integrity of emission inventories; (iv) performing long-term high-resolution simulations with multiple point sources is prohibitive due to computational demands; (v) good quality monitoring will always be required; (vi) the standards have broad and far-reaching implications for resource managers, resource users and possibly the economy of individual regions and the country as a whole; (vii) the successful implementation of the National Environmental Standards for Ambient Air Quality in New Zealand will integrate a thorough understanding of modelling, measurements, meteorology and emissions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NES</field><field name="subject">TAPM</field><field name="subject">airshed</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Place and its Co-Construction in the Global Network Society</field><field name="creator">Ashton, Hazel</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how locally-constructed agency, based on what we really care about, can be developed within and thence beyond localities. At issue is the need for new forms of connectedness and belonging in the globally-based network society. Globally-based communications and media technologies create new networks and mobilities that stretch and fragment existing socio-economic, administrative and ecological systems and with this, older, local and national forms of sociality. Such social upheavals are apt to drive people into defensive and divisive "us" against "them" forms of belonging. Local communities are then called on almost daily to fix these problems, but scarcely exist as connected effective agents on their own account. The thesis examines how official institutions (policy and academic) can help undo one-way global-local flows, by supporting new forms of local-local and local-through-to-global agency. A transdisciplinary methodology, developed in this thesis, performatively demonstrates productive, new local-academic-policy connections. Research included a fully participatory process that blends theoretical concepts (social, aesthetic, literary and film), with film and interactive technologies. A microcosm or simulation of locality was created through DVD film and an interactive research website. Through the shared use of screen interfaces, over one hundred co-detectives or co-researchers from hugely diverse backgrounds collaborated to search for, help reveal, and test out ways that local inhabitants could more effectively connect and co-create a filmed narrative of the kind of place that all would like to inhabit. A "network locality" development narrative is here piloted as a counterpoint to the global network society. Based on inclusive co-construction of locally grounded technology - and aesthetic-based communities - new possibilities of belonging around engagement in locally grounded civic-cosmopolitan projects are demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transdisciplinary methodology</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">international communications technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Amygdala and Other Forebrain Structures in the Immediate Fear Arousal Produced by Footshock Exposure</field><field name="creator">Ganev, Jennifer</field><field name="description">When a human or animal is threatened or confronted with a stimuli signalling danger, internal defence mechanisms are activated that evoke feelings of fear and anxiety. These emotional responses promote the behaviour patterns necessary for an organism's survival. Animal research seeks to understand how these emotions affect behaviour both physiologically and neurologically in order to develop effective treatment for those suffering from severe anxiety disorders. The aim of this thesis was to examine the role of the amygdala, and dorsal and ventral hippocampus in relation to immediate fear arousal brought on by footshock. This was assessed by examining whether muscimol would interfere with the acoustic startle response before or after footshock presentation, and then comparing these reactions to a control group that received saline infusions. The results of this research are extremely important because they identify various brain structures involved in the fear-arousing effects of footshock as measured by the shock sensitization of acoustic startle. Laboratory rats received muscimol (0.1ug and 0.01ug) infusions into the basolateral amygdala, dorsal and ventral hippocampus. These three brain regions have been identified as playing a prominent role in fear neurocircuitry. The results demonstrated that the GABA A receptor agonist muscimol in doses of 0.1ug and 0.01ug reliably blocked shock sensitization of the acoustic startle response. The muscimol doses did not alter the shock reactivity amplitudes therefore indicating a normal perception of the fear arousing properties of footshock. Therefore, the present study's results suggest that a decrease of GABA activity in the amygdala, dorsal and ventral hippocampus may be essential for the neuronal basis of fear acquisition and expression of unconditioned and conditioned stimuli.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amygdala</field><field name="subject">footshock</field><field name="subject">hippocamps</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">sensitization</field><field name="subject">muscimol</field><field name="subject">fear conditioning</field><field name="subject">fear learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a monosyllabic adaptive speech test for the identification of central auditory processing disorder.</field><field name="creator">McGaffin, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Auditory processing is the ability of the brain to manipulate and utilise the neural output of the ear based on the frequency, intensity, and temporal features of the incoming acoustic signal. An auditory processing disorder (APD) is a deficiency in this ability. One category of tests that examine auditory processing ability are the various versions of the "filtered words test" (FWT), whereby a monaural, low-redundancy speech sample is distorted by using filtering to modify its frequency content. Due to the richness of the neural pathways in the auditory system and the redundancy of acoustic information in spoken language, a normal listener is able to recognize speech even when parts of the signal are missing, whereas this ability is often impaired in listeners with APD. One limitation of the various versions of the FWT is that they are carried out using a constant level of low-pass filtering (e.g. a corner frequency of 1000 Hz), which is prone to ceiling and floor effects. The purpose of this study was to counter these effects by modifying the FWT to use a computer-based adaptive procedure, to improve the sensitivity of the test over its constant-level counterparts. The University of Canterbury Monosyllabic Adaptive Speech Test (UC MAST) was performed on 23 normal adults, and 32 normal children (7 to 11 years of age). The child participants also underwent the SCAN-C test for APD in Children (Revised). Findings indicated a significant maturational effect on the UC MAST. Adult participants performed significantly better on the UC MAST in comparison to the child participants. In addition, adult participants performed the UC MAST more reliably than their younger counterparts. No correlation was found between performance on the UC MAST and SCAN-C test. The development of the UC MAST is discussed and the clinical implications of the findings are explored.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">audiology</field><field name="subject">speech testing</field><field name="subject">speech perception</field><field name="subject">adaptive procedures</field><field name="subject">auditory maturation</field><field name="subject">auditory processing disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand Onchidiidae and aspects of the biology and the life cycle of Onchidella nigricans</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Barry Lee</field><field name="description">The family Onchidiidae is perhaps one of the most neglected the Gastropoda. This is rather surprising since it affinities to both the Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata, so is of importance with regard to the phylogenetic relationships of these two groups. As would be expected, the Onchidiidae have been classed sometimes as opisthobranchs and at others as pulmonates , but the latest work on the subject, that of Fretter (1943), regards them as an early offshoot from the main stem of the opisthobranchs. In the New Zealand region only one Genus, Onchidella, is represented, Apart from early accounts of the systematics of the group, and a more recent one (McDowall 1943, unpublished thesis) on anatomy, there has been no research into any other aspect. This has left an open field for the present study, Recourse to what literature there was on the New Zealand Onchidiidae, revealed the necessity for a re-examination of the taxonomy of the Genus. Descriptions of the six species given in Suter's manual (1913) were notable for their lack of characterization of the species. To clarify the systematics it was found   to be necessary to study the external morphology and anatomy of animals from all over New Zealand. Naturally enough this lead to the accumulation of details regarding their distribution. Once the various species could be identified with certainty,  all further observations were concentrated on on one species, Onchidella nigricans. An ideal site for research into the  ecology and reproduction of this species was discovered at Gladstone Pier in the Lyttelton Harbour. As far as general ecology was concerned, investigations were restricted to studies on the habitat and homing behaviour, while population dynamics constituted an interesting analysis of the aggregations of animals in the crevices to which the animals home. Reproduction was investigated under the headings of breeding and development; breeding covering copul ation and oviposition and development the anatomical changes and reorganisations necessary during the transformation of the egg to a young adult. To confirm the breeding times gametogenesis was studied, this also showing the cyclical changes undergone by the gonads during the year. In the conclusions the relations of the family are discussed in the light of a recent paper by Fretter (1943), and of the research carried out in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1962</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Onchidiidae</field><field name="subject">Onchidella nigricans</field><field name="subject">mulluscs</field><field name="subject">life cycle</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentation in the New River Estuary, Southland</field><field name="creator">Thoms, Martin Charles</field><field name="description">The New River Estuary is a large mesotidal estuary connected to Foveaux Strait by way of an inlet, and has two principle rivers (the Oreti and the Waihopai) flowing into it. The purposes of this study have been to describe the sediment distribution within the estuary; investigate the sediment source-sink relationships.; to calculate whether on a net basis sediment is being deposited in or eroded from the New River Estuary, and to investigate some of the influences on the sediment dynamics of this estuary. Textural analysis of the sediment indicated that there are three sedimentary environments within the estuary, and each is distinguishable due to the relative mix of fine sand. It was shown that Foveaux Strait is a dominant source of medium-fine sand. The Oreti River and the channels of the main estuary body are also important sources of these sediments. Medium-fine sand is transferred into the estuary and very fine sand is transferred out of the estuary and onto the continental shelf. Aerial photographs indicated that estuarine morphology was stable over a 31 year period (from 1947 to 1978). However a network of scour rods indicated that the intertidal sediment surface was spatially and temporally dynamic. It was calculated that on a net basis sediment was deposited in the estuary over a five month period. An important influence on the sedimentation of the New River Estuary has been the reduction of the tidal com partment by 25%, due to the reclamation of 12.2 km2.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine sediments</field><field name="subject">New River Estuary</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Historical shoreline change and beach morphodynamics at Rapahoe Bay, West Coast, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ishikawa, Rei</field><field name="description">This thesis utilises a range of methodologies to investigate the historical shoreline change and beach morphodynamics at Rapahoe Bay, West Coast, New Zealand. Rapahoe Bay is a small embayment located 15 km north of Greymouth, and contains a complex and dynamic environment under a dominant swell condition. The objectives of this thesis include the investigation the coastline history through aerial photographs and relevant literature, identify and quantify historical shoreline change and the processes that have induced change, examine the short term and seasonal changes in beach profile, identify and quantify wave and transport process and to test the applicability of the zeta shoreline curve on a composite beach. This combined approach investigates the dynamics and process drivers involved in coastline change. This thesis contributes to the research gap of understanding morphodynamic behaviour and controls of composite beach under a dominant swell. Composite beaches types are a variation from mixed sand and gravel beaches with distinct morphological differences. This thesis provides an insight in to the morphodynamic behaviour of composite beaches. The study area contains a small village based by the shoreline and the potential coastal hazard that threatens people, property and infrastructure. Therefore the results from this thesis have an important management implication towards mitigating coastal hazards. The historical coastline change was induced through a combination of wave processes and transport, composite beach morphodynamic behaviour, anthropogenic influence and planform shape. Results show that human infrastructure restricted the retreat of a small hapua landward of the gravel barrier. A combination of change in sediment supply, consistent sediment transport and a high wave energy environment resulted in rapid landward retreat through gravel rollover and coastal erosion. The gravel barrier morphodynamics include increase in crest elevation, steeper shore gradients as a response to high swells resulting in erosion or rollover. The wave environment includes a sediment transport hinge point due to a dominant wave refraction and changes in the shoreline orientation, which further induces coastal erosion. The valid applicability of the zeta planform shape concludes that the shoreline may further iii retreat due to geological controls, potential sediment transport and the transgressive nature of the composite beaches. The combination of methods and results provide both quantified historical change and also potential future scenarios of coastline reshaping. These methods and results are applicable not only to Rapahoe but along other West Coast composite beaches, and the validity of the combination of methods provides a greater understanding of the behaviour of morphodynamic composite beaches and provides quantified results of historical shoreline change and sediment transport at the field site.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shoreline change</field><field name="subject">Rapahoe Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stuttering characteristics of German-English bilingual speakers</field><field name="creator">Schaefer, Martina</field><field name="description">To date, limited research has been reported on stuttering and bilingualism. Existing data reports conflicting results on stuttering characteristics across languages of bilingual people who stutter (PWS). Investigations to date include language acquisition, language proficiency, cultural influence, and linguistic as well as phonetic aspects in bilinguals PWS. Thus, assumptions on causal factors of stuttering are plenty, but research is missing to either support or refute those assumptions. Small sample sizes have been an additional obstacle. The purpose of this study was to analyse stuttering characteristics in German - English bilingual PWS. 15 German - English bilingual PWS, ranging in age between 10 and 59 years (mean = 25) were investigated. For all of the participants, German was acquired first (L1) and English second (L2). L2 exposure ranged from 5 to 20+ years (mean = 10). 15 minute conversational speech samples were collected in each language. In addition, an English proficiency test (Cloze Test) and a post-conversational questionnaire were administered. Analysis focused on differences in stuttering severity across languages, the distribution of stuttered content and function words across languages, and possible relationships between L2 proficiency and stuttering. Results indicated significantly more stuttering in L1 compared to L2. In L1, stuttering occurred significantly more often on content words. In L2, no significant difference between stuttering on function and content words was observed. For percentage of syllables stuttered, across language analysis detected significantly more stuttering on content words in German (L1) and more stuttering on function words in English (L2). No direct correlations between stuttering and language proficiency have been found. Results are discussed in light of current theories of stuttering and relationships to past findings are drawn.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingual</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">German</field><field name="subject">stuttering</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pollination and dispersal of the noxious vine Passiflora mollissima</field><field name="creator">Beavon, Merodie</field><field name="description">Banana passionfruit (Passiflora mollissima) is a noxious weedy vine that is problematic in coastal regions throughout New Zealand. I investigated the pollination and dispersal mutualisms that facilitate its spread, in the Marlborough Sounds. Flower observations revealed that visits were almost exclusively from introduced honey bees and bumble bees, indicating an invasive mutualism. I investigated the pollination system of banana passionfruit by comparing fruit set, fruit size, seed set, germination success and the effects of inbreeding depression on seedlings when grown in competition, between hand-selfed, handcrossed, bagged and open flowers. Fruit set was significantly reduced when pollinators were excluded (3.0%) indicating reliance on pollinators for reproduction. While banana passionfruit is partially selfcompatible, fruit set was significantly reduced in selfed flowers (17.5%) compared to crossed flowers (29.5%), and we found significant pollen limitation (natural [18.0%] was significantly lower than crossed). A significant degree of inbreeding depression was apparent in germination success but not in fruit size, seed set or seedling growth and survival. Surprisingly, open flowers had significantly lower germination success (10.1%) than the other three treatments (crossed = 16.5%, selfed = 15.0%, bagged = 25.3%). Overall, natural flowers produce more seedlings per flower (1.7) than bagged flowers (0.9), but less than hand-selfed (3.0) and crossed (5.3) flowers. To investigate dependence on dispersal, germination success was compared between hand-cleaned seeds, fleshy seeds and intact fruits in the field and glasshouse. Seeds germinated readily in all treatments, with no significant difference between cleaned and fleshy seeds, so seeds do not require frugivore handling to germinate. In the field, tagged fruits were removed quickly after ripening. Significantly fewer fruit were wholly removed from off-road locations than locations on road edges, but removal rate was high in both cases (93% and 70%) indicating dispersal by both humans and wild animals. I found no evidence of dispersal by birds. Infra-red camera evidence revealed possums and rats consuming fruits in the field. In addition, 2818 seeds were extracted from 1.5 kg of pig excrement collected from Te Weu Weu Bay in February 2006. Seeds readily germinated following extraction from pig and possum droppings with a final germination success, in the glasshouse, of 45.6% and 53% respectively. None of the few intact seeds excreted by rats germinated. Therefore, together with direct weed control, limiting the spread of banana passionfruit through the control of pigs and possums may improve management success and reduce the spread of banana passionfruit.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pollination</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">Passiflora mollissima</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technologies for tissue preservation: the role of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants in preserving tissue function in chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</field><field name="creator">Tuckey, Nicholas Pierre Lemieux</field><field name="description">The seafood industry is of considerable importance to both the New Zealand and global economies and therefore tissue preservation technologies that increase product quality and/or prolong shelf life have the potential to add significant value. Technologies for maintaining the viability of isolated tissues also have a wide range of other medical and industrial applications. This thesis examines the relationship between metabolic function, oxidation and cell death and the resulting stability of the non-viable tissues during long term storage in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) red and white skeletal muscle tissue. This research also looks at the role of the aquatic anaesthetic AQUI-S&#8482;, in which the active ingredient is isoeugenol (a lipid soluble antioxidant), and other antioxidant compounds in preserving metabolic function in viable tissues and tissue stability in nonviable tissues. Perfusion of salmon tails at 15&#8451; over 5 or 10 hours with oxygen saturated saline resulted in significant increases in protein and lipid oxidation (protein carbonyl and TBARS concentrations respectively) in the red muscle, but not the white muscle. The introduction of ascorbic acid and uric acid into the saline did not reduce the oxidation in the red muscle despite significantly increasing their respective concentrations in the tissue. This indicates the difficulties associated with attempting to extend tissue viability by delivering free oxygen to the tissue and also highlights the difference in susceptibility of the two muscle types to oxidation. Tail fillets from salmon harvested in both rested and exhausted physiological states using AQUI-S&#8482;, and fillets from exhausted salmon harvested without AQUI-S&#8482;, were exposed to air at 15&#8451; for up to 96 hours. Protein carbonyls increased in a roughly linear fashion over the entire 96 hours in all three groups. Both lipid peroxides (TBARS) and uric acid concentrations began to increase in the exhausted group after 30 hours. In contrast, no significant increases in lipid peroxides or uric acid was seen in the fillets from either group harvested using AQUI-S&#8482;. Vitamin E concentrations reduced slowly but did not change significantly despite the oxidation that was evident in the tissue. These processes also occurred in salmon tail fillets during storage at 6&#8451;. The measurement of ATP related compounds provides an effective indicator of both the metabolic state of the tissue post-harvest and the quality. The breakdown of these compounds is also associated with the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Fresh rested salmon fillets had high concentrations of ATP and creatine phosphate, which were both depleted after 12 hours storage at 15&#8451;. This indicates that cell viability lasted a number of hours following harvesting. These metabolites were depleted in exhausted fillets and metabolic potential appeared to be immediately compromised. The concentration of the taste enhancing compound IMP was significantly reduced in fresh rested tissue, but increased during storage, and was significantly higher than in exhausted tissues following 12 hours of storage at 15&#8451;. This indicates that some properties of rested tissues may improve with limited storage times. The accumulation of uric acid - the metabolic end point for ATP related compounds - was also significantly reduced in rested tissue and increases in K-value were slowed. AQUI-S&#8482; showed an ability to preserve tissue function through its anaesthetic action allowing tissue to be harvested in a rested state, and to reduce late stage lipid oxidation in stored salmon tail fillets. The antioxidant action of isoeugenol in salmon fillets may be mediated through its ability to chelate transition metals released during tissue degradation. This research shows that during reperfusion and during fillet storage there is a significant level of oxidative stress, which needs to be minimized while maintaining basic tissue metabolism to prolong tissue and cellular viability. The development of future technologies to preserve tissue viability may depend on the development of a synthetic oxygen carrying compound with properties similar to red blood cells. This may allow more control over oxygen delivery, potentially reducing the oxidative stress associated with high concentrations of free oxygen in solution. However, preserving cell viability will also require the maintenance of endogenous antioxidant function and there is also the potential to use iron chelating compounds including plant derived flavonoids to preserve non-viable tissues. Future research in these areas is necessary.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chinook salmon</field><field name="subject">AQUI-S&#8482;</field><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">post-harvest metabolic state</field><field name="subject">fillet storage</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">protein oxidation</field><field name="subject">endogenous antioxidants</field><field name="subject">exogenous antioxidants</field><field name="subject">K-value</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of three close eclipsing binary systems: BP Velorum, V392 Carinae and V752 Centauri</field><field name="creator">Schumacher, Hana Josephine</field><field name="description">This thesis reports photometric and spectroscopic studies of three close binary systems; BP Velorum, V392 Carinae and V752 Centauri. BP Velorum, a W UMa-type binary, was observed photometrically in February 2007. The light curves in four filters were fitted simultaneously with a model generated in the eclipsing binary modeling software package PHOEBE. The best model was one with a cool star spot on the secondary larger component. The light curves showed additional cycle-to-cycle variations near the times of maximum light which may indicate the presence of star spots that vary in strength and/or location on a time scale comparable with the orbital period, (P = 0.265 d). The system was confirmed to belong to the W-type subgroup of W UMa binaries for which the deeper primary minimum is due to an occultation. V392 Carinae, a detached binary with an orbital period of 3.147 d, was observed photometrically by Michael Snowden in 1997. These observations were reduced and combined with the published light curve from Debernardi and North (2001). High resolution spectroscopic images were taken using the University of Canterbury's HERCULES spectrograph. The radial velocities measured from these observations were combined with velocities from Debernardi and North (2001). The radial velocity and light curves were fit simultaneously, confirming that V392 Car is a detached system of two main sequence A stars with a mass-ratio of 0.95. The derived systematic velocity is consistent with V392 Car being a member of the open cluster NGC 2516. The W UMa-type binary V752 Centauri was observed photometrically and spectroscopically during 2007. The high resolution spectra displayed weak sharp lined features superimposed over the strong broad lined spectrum expected from the 0.370 d contact binary. Fourier methods were used to separate the broad and sharp spectral features and radial velocities for each were measured by cross-correlation. A fit to the photometry and radial velocities for the contact binary implied a system of two late F stars with a mass-ratio of 3.38 in an over-contact configuration. The derived systematic velocity (&#8722;13.8km/s), has changed significantly from the 1972 value (29.2km/s). The third (sharp lined) component's radial velocities were measured and found to have a period of 5.147 d, semi-amplitude of 43.4km/s and systematic velocity of &#8722;7.3km/s. The likely configuration of the entire system is that of a contact binary in a long period orbit about a lower mass detached binary. V752 Cen is thus a triple lined spectroscopic quadruple.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eclipsing binaries</field><field name="subject">close binaries</field><field name="subject">W UMa type stars</field><field name="subject">SB2 binaries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Seaports of the South Island of New Zealand : A Comparative Study in Port Geography.</field><field name="creator">Ward, Graham</field><field name="description">The study of urban geography has received increasing attention in recent years both in this country and overseas. Its content and method have been recently surveyed, and a considerable amount of research on these lines has been done here in New Zealand. Within this field the geography of ports forms a distinct branch for study since ports themselves are a specialised part of some urban areas. Indeed, over the past few years there has developed an extensive geographical literature dealing with ports. This field, which could be termed 'port geography' has attracted some interest in New Zealand as a subject for research; but in the past, studies of ports have been limited to examinations of individual ports, groups of ports, or one aspect of ports. This present study, however , has been made upon broader lines. It is an attempt to describe, analyse, and compare the most important aspects of the contemporary character of the South Island seaports. It is suggested that the character of a port is derived principally from the nature of its location, site, form or pattern, facilities, trade, hinterland and fishing. Since these are the most important features, they are analysed and described in turn in this thesis. This systematic approach was found necessary in order that significant comparisons and contrasts - which is the essence of geography - might be drawn between the ports. The problem can be expressed in the question: "In what ways do the characters of the South Island seaports differ one from another?" "A port is a place equipped to facilitate the necessary relations between ships as the agencies of sea transport and the land," and provides "terminal facilities and services for ships, and transfer facilities and services for ships, and transfer facilities and services for waterbourne goods and/or passengers." In these general terms there are many places in the South Island of New Zealand which could be considered as ports. However, only those South Island seaports which make returns to the New Zealand Census and Statistics Department have been included in this study; namely , the ports of Waitapu, Motueka, Nelson, Picton, Wairu, Lyttelton, Timaru, Oamaru, Otago, Bluff, Greymouth and Westport. This thesis is based both on fieldwork carried out by the writer during 1953 and the early months of 1954, and on an examination of statistical and other material drawn from a wide variety of sources in Wellington and in South Island centres. All the ports included in the survey were visited in the course of the fieldwork. Section by section land utilisation surveys were made of the port vicinities of the thirteen largest ports from aerial photographs in Head Office, Lands &amp; Survey Department, Wellington, and from actual field investigations. A large number of people were interviewed at the ports and in the towns of their tributary regions. The statistics used in this study have been related as closely as possible to the calendar year 1952 and have been presented in the form of maps, cartograms, and graphs, rather than in a series of tables. The analysis of these diagrams provides the comparative data on which three of the eight chapters are based. Since the majority of the maps have been compiled from numerous sources they have been annotated separately in AppendiX A. All photographs, except those whi ch have been otherwise acknowledged, were taken by the author. All maps and diagrams were also compiled and drawn by the author. A list of the works consulted in the preparation of this thesis are contained in the bibliography.</field><field name="date">1954</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seaports</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">urban geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mackenzie Basin : a regional study in the South Island high country.</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Ronald Kincaid</field><field name="description">During recent years the high country of the South Island has attracted a good deal of attention from farm economists, soil conservationists, geographers and also politicians. With the present need for increased national production the problem of keeping the high country in productive occupation is the subject of justifiable concern. The purpose of this regional study is to describe one of the most distinctive areas in the high country, and to discuss the problems which have caused the recent Royal Commission on the Sheep-farming Industry in New Zealand to investigate the general economic position of the runholders. Besides being a well-defined physiographic unit, the Mackenzie Basin or, as it is better known to the local people, the Mackenzie Country has a distinctive character of its own. On entering Burkes Pass even the most casual observer cannot fail to notice how different the landscape within the basin appears compared with that outside. This large, gravel-filled intermontane depression with its vast expanse of dun coloured tussock and its clear, dry climate seems to have a special flavour which distinguishes it from any other part of either Canterbury or Otago. Probably the most striking feature of the basin is its monotonous uniformity of both physical conditions and human activities. The extensive sheep-farming economy has imposed a distinctive pattern of land use over the whole area. Not only does the landscape have a similar appearance everywhere but, because of their common int erests, the people all tend to live alike and think alike. Before 1939 the basin was solely a sheep-grazing area but, with the recent developments connected with the storage of water in the lakes for the generation of hydro-electricity, the Mackenzie Country has assumed a new importance. With the dam-building schemes at Tekapo and Pukaki an entirely new element has been introduced into the landscape - the large Public Works Camp. These camps, however, are, for the most part, temporary features and the sheep-station remains the typical unit of settlement. For this reason the major part of this study is devoted to a description of the landscape as it has developed under the extensive sheep-farming economy and a discussion of the problems resulting from the exploitation of the natural vegetation. When the early settlers first took up their runs they had the opportunity of making the Mackenzie basin one of the best merino grazing areas in New Zealand. In most cases that opportunity was lost, due partly to ignorance of proper grazing methods under sub-humid conditions and partly to short-sighted practices caused by temporary economic difficulties. Over-burning and over-stocking extracted an early toll from the vegetation cover which, in spite of numerous attempts can never be fully repaid. By deliberately introducing rabbits into the area the early runholders made their third and possibly their greatest mistake. These rabbits were allowed to multiply unchecked for nearly twenty years before it was realised what a menace they were likely to become. By that time it was too late. Today, the rabbit is generally considered to be the chief cause of the disturbing decline in the sheep carrying capacity of the Mackenzie Country. Altogether, unwise burning, overstocking and rabbits have caused such a deterioration in the tussock cover that Cumberland's description of some parts of the basin as "deserts in the making" is quite appropriate. Admittedly conditions are not as bad as in the "man-made deserts" of Central Otago but a serious problem at present confronts the Mackenzie runholders.</field><field name="date">1949</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">high country farming</field><field name="subject">Mackanzie Country</field><field name="subject">pastoralism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of harvesting procedures on physiological and biochemical properties of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) white muscle prior to and during frozen storage</field><field name="creator">Cook, Denham Grant</field><field name="description">The object of this thesis was to investigate the role of two different harvest protocols on the post mortem physiology of Chinook salmon, and associated deteriorative processes that occur during frozen storage of the white muscle tissue. The two different harvest methods employed, termed 'rested' and 'exercised', were selected because of the contrasting levels of activity of the animal prior to, and upon, slaughter. While the latter represents conventional harvest techniques Rested and exercised harvesting protocols produced tissue in significantly different physiological states. Immediately post harvest, rested tissue maintained high metabolic energy stores of ATP and glycogen within the tissue, with low concentrations of tissue and plasma lactate. Exercised tissue exhibited near depleted concentrations of ATP and glycogen and a marked metabolic acidosis and lactate accumulation. When frozen immediately post harvest, rested white muscle tissue stored at -19&#8451; showed no significant changes in these metabolite concentrations over a six month period of profiling. However, during storage of rested tissue at -9&#8451;, hydrolysis of ATP and glycogen with no coincident increase in lactate was observed. No significant changes in metabolite levels were observed within exercised tissue stored at -19 and -9&#8451;, owing to the lack of metabolic energy stores. Transfer of tissue from frozen (-80 and -19&#8451;) to chilled (-1 and +4&#8451;) temperatures witnessed a rapid depletion of tissue ATP and glycogen stores, with rapid increases in tissue lactate concentrations. This metabolic activity was more significant in rested tissue owing to the larger concentrations of metabolic energy stores. This metabolic activity was identified to occur between the temperatures of -3 and -1.5&#8451; and occurred abruptly (i.e. ATP concentrations depleting in less than one hour) in time. During frozen storage (-19&#8451; and -9&#8451;), harvest treatment had no significant effect on lipid oxidation processes. However, rested tissue showed a significant ability to retard lipid oxidation processes once removed from frozen storage and placed at chilled temperatures. Throughout six months storage at -19&#8451; storage, harvest treatment had a significant effect on the rate of protein denaturation as rested tissue consistently held higher concentrations of soluble protein over the storage period. No significant effect was observed between treatments in the rate of protein denaturation during one month frozen (-19&#8451;) then chilled (+4&#8451;) storage. In a supplementary frozen (-80&#8451;) then chilled (-1&#8451;) storage experiment, post mortem storage of rested, whole fish, at chilled (+5&#8451;) temperatures prior to white muscle excision and freezing, was compared to rested and exercised tissue in which the white muscle had been excised and then frozen immediately post harvest. In this experiment rested tissue exposed to a 6 or 24 hour post mortem chilled storage period demonstrated significant retardation of lipid oxidation processes when compared to rested white muscle tissue that was excised and frozen immediately post harvest. Further comparison of the six and 24 hour post mortem stored tissue showed a significant increase in lipid oxidation products after 21 and 24 days chilled storage, respectively. Comparison of results from the six and 24 hour post mortem storage experiment were bordering on significance (p=0.083), warranting further investigation on the effect of post mortem storage of rested tissue on lipid oxidation processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">muscle</field><field name="subject">salmon</field><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">harvest</field><field name="subject">oxidation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mating behaviour and the reproductive ecology of the big-handed crab, Heterozius rotundifrons A. Milne Edwards, 1867</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Glen Andrew</field><field name="description">The mating behaviour and reproductive ecology of the big-handed crab Heterozius rotundifrons was studied at Kaikoura between November 1997 and December 1998. H. rotundifrons was found at mean densities of 7.6 per m&#178; (&#177; 1.4) within the middle and low shore levels and varied little between seasons. The variance! mean ratio indicated that males and females aggregated within these shore levels. The sex ratio was significantly female biased during the majority of the year. Allometric growth rates indicated that males and females reached sexual maturity at 11 mm carapace width (CW). In males, spermatozoa production occurred between 9-9.99 mm CW. Ovigerous females were present every month except February. The first broods of the year were produced in March which coincides with a decrease in the female gonado-somatic index (GSI). These broods were incubated for approximately nine months whereas broods produced in August were incubated for only five months. Female brood production appeared to be cyclical, alternating between a winter incubation period and a summer incubation period. The completed cycle takes approximately three years with two broods produced during the cycle. Fecundity increased with female size but egg mortality was quite high (19%). Instantaneous mortality rate increased with increasing brood development. Females mate when recently moulted (soft-shelled). Although females moulted through out the year, in small numbers, there was a peak in female moulting during October and November. The operational sex ratio (OSR) was male biased during all months of the year. Females released an attractant prior to moulting which initiated pre-copulatory mate guarding by the male. Once the female moulted, copulation occurred approximately 6 h later. Copulation lasted for approximately 3 h and was followed by a period of post-copulatory mate guarding. Males increased the duration of post-copulatory mate guarding if another male was present. Large males out competed small males for receptive females. Males used their large cheliped to subdue competitors and to provide protection for the soft female. Mate guarding was shown to reduce cannibalism from other females. Spermatozoa are packaged in spermatophores within the vas deferens of males but are quickly dehisced within the spermathecae (ventral-type) of newly mated females. Last male to copulate probably achieves the highest level of paternity. Postcopulatory mate guarding by the male was found and ejaculates were found in discrete packets within the spermatheca. Sperm competition appeared to be important because large males displaced small males during copulation, males left when a female was still receptive and the females could retain sperm between moults. It is concluded that H. rotundifrons probably has a polygynous mating system in which males compete for soft females (female centered competition)</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mating behaviour</field><field name="subject">reproductive ecology</field><field name="subject">Heterozius rotundifrons</field><field name="subject">big-handed crab</field><field name="subject">sperm competition</field><field name="subject">polygynous mating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controls on deposition of coal and clastic sediment in the Waikato coal measures</field><field name="creator">Hall, Steven Leon</field><field name="description">Coal seams in the Waikato Coal Measures can vary significantly in thickness over distances of hundreds of meters to kilometers. Previously, the primary depositional controls on these variations have been inferred to be syn-depositional normal faulting and pre-depositional paleotopography. The data presented in support of these models are typically equivocal and which, if any, of these processes provide the principal control on the geometry and spatial distribution of coal seams in the Waikato Coal Region is uncertain. This study utilizes a large database of drill-logs, seismic-reflection lines and mine exposures in four areas (Huntly, Maramarua, North HuntlylWaikare and Rotowaro Coalfields) to test whether syn-depositional faulting and/or paleotopography influence coal seam architecture. These data were used to construct cross sections across faults and basement topography, which in turn, offer information on the relative timing of faulting and coal measure deposition, together with information on the spatial relations between seam thicknesses, faulting and paleotopography. Cross sections and isopach maps together with examination of spatial and temporal variations in fault displacements reveal that syn-depositional normal faulting had little or no impact on the deposition of the Waikato Coal Measures. Only in the Maramarua study area was any evidence found of fault control on coal measure deposition, with the Landing Fault accruing displacement between deposition of the Kupalrupa Seam and the end of coal measure sedimentation. The vast majority of faults in the Waikato Coalfield were, however, active following coal measure deposition. For example, the Foote, Kimihia and Pukekapia faults show evidence of displacement accrual, which commenced during deposition of the Mangakotuku Formation (37-35 Ma BP). The duration of this episode of faulting is difficult to determine, but may have ceased about 30 Ma ago. In addition, a number of faults (e.g. Foote Fault) display evidence oflate stage extension during the last 5 Ma. Given the lack of stratigraphic evidence for fault displacements during deposition of coal measures, it is suggested that the Mangakotuku and Waipuna basement scarps are erosional rather than tectonic features. Cross sections, together with structure contour and isopach maps in each of the four study areas examined, indicate that basement topography was the dominant control on the spatially variable accumulation of peat. These data show coal seams both thinning into, and away from, topographic lows. To account for this observation a model is proposed, in which peat accumulation is controlled by basement relief and sediment supply to parts of the depositional system. In the model it is postulated that the Waikato Coal Measures depositional system was a continuum between two end members. In one end member, with a high sediment supply, sediment is channeled into the lowest topographic areas and peat accumulates mainly on topographic highs. In the other end member, with little or no sediment supply, peat accumulates to its greatest thickness in areas of relatively low topography, in addition to on basement ridges. In the Rotowaro and North Huntly/Waikare study areas, the thickest peat developed on basement highs and the lows acted as a conduit for sedimentation. On basement highs, peat mires were largely sheltered from clastic sediment influx. In the Huntly East and Maramarua study areas, the thickest peat accumulated in basement lows, with comparable clastic sedimentation in highs and lows. The proposed model has application to other coalfields where peat accumulated on an undulating topographic surface and sediment supply was channelised. Prediction of coal seam thickness, as well as lithological types, is crucial in coal exploration and development. The methodology developed and employed in this study can be applied to other basins to access and model coal and clastic sediment distribution.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Waikato Coal Measures</field><field name="subject">syn-depositional faulting</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="subject">coal seams</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation in advertisement call structure of whistling frogs</field><field name="creator">Hay, Timothy D</field><field name="description">Variation in advertisement call structure of whistling frogs, Litoria ewingi, was studied among breeding sites in the vicinity of Christchurch on the East coast and Harihari on the West coast of the South Island. Males vocalized in breeding choruses throughout the year and females moved toward and appeared to evaluate calls of territorial males before initiating amplexus. Acoustic interactions between neighbours led to modification of call structure and timing, and wrestling matches between males were frequent. I quantified call structure for 1623 calls of 168 individuals using 24 call parameters. Most temporal characteristics were significantly correlated with the caller's body temperature and dominant frequency was negatively correlated with body size. These results are consistent with the prediction of temperature-dependent metabolic rates in a poikilotherm's nervous system. I compared call structure among the study populations using both multivariate and univariate analyses. Advertisement call structure showed highly significant variation among populations for most call variables. The greatest difference occurred between the West and East coast populations, and a clinal trend occurred in the East coast populations on a microgeographic scale. Variation among East coast populations in some variables was comparable to the scale of variation between coasts. These results suggest that whistling frogs exhibit natal philopatry. I obtained repeated recordings for 21 individuals and examined variation in call structure within and among individuals using nested multivariate analyses of variance. Highly significant variation occurred both within and among individuals for most call characters, but certain call characters were more variable among individuals. This suggests that whistling frog advertisement calls are individually distinctive.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertisement calls</field><field name="subject">whistling frogs</field><field name="subject">Litoria ewingi</field><field name="subject">calling behaviour</field><field name="subject">vocalization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproductive strategies of the pill-box crab Halicarcinus innominatus Richardson, 1949</field><field name="creator">Dunnington, Michael James</field><field name="description">This study examines the reproductive strategies of the Pill-box crab, Halicarcinus innominatus, at the Oaro Platform (24 km south of the Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand). As necessary components of reproductive strategies, the population dynamics, reproductive biology and mating behaviour of H. innominetus were examined from December 1997 through December 1998. There were obvious sexually dimorphic differences in secondary sexual traits in this species. Both males and females display a wide range of sizes over which individuals can moult to maturity. H. innominatus females displayed continuous breeding throughout the year, resulting in continuous recruitment. Females were found to outnumber males in each month. However, when comparisons were made between mature males and females with different brood stages (i.e. 0-5), males outnumbered each female type in each month. Investigations into the reproductive biology of H. innominatus females revealed that brood development and ovary development were in phase. This resulted in the ability of females to produce several broods in quick succession. Ovary development began before the moult to maturity, allowing for immediate production of a brood after the moult to maturity. Egg incubation periods were dependent on water temperature, being longest in the winter and shortest in the summer. Egg numbers were found to increase with female body size, but mortality of eggs through development was apparent. Sperm storage was found to occur in this species with possible layering of different ejaculates. Copulations were only observed between males and females in hard-shell conditions. Males mated more often with females carrying stage 5 broods, but also mated with all other female types, including pre-pubescent females. Postcopulatory mate guarding only occurred with stage 5 females. Males can detect females of different reproductive condition, which seems to be linked to the developmental stages of the females' ovaries. In conclusion, H. innominatus males seem to have two tactics to their reproductive strategies: mating with any receptive female, but only guarding stage 5 females.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reproductive strategies</field><field name="subject">pill-box crab</field><field name="subject">Halicarcinus innominatus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The extent of forest fragmentation in New Zealand and its effects on arthropod biodiversity</field><field name="creator">Ewers, Robert Mark</field><field name="description">Historically, New Zealand was almost completely forested below the alpine treeline, but 1000 years of Polynesian and European colonisation has resulted in the destruction of nearly three-quarters of the original forest cover. I assessed historical patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation in relation to all major topographical, climatic and anthropogenic variables that may drive forest loss. Much of the deforestation occurred in regions with drier climates, reflecting the fact that human population density has always been highest in areas with moderately dry climates and that dry forests burned much more readily and extensively. The large remaining tracts of forest are mainly restricted to high elevations, while the lowland forests have been fragmented into small, isolated remnants. Fragmentation of the surviving forests increases their susceptibility to edge effects and invasion by adventive species, indelibly altering the ecological communities they support. Although a large proportion of the remaining forest is owned or managed by the Department of Conservation, the distribution of that protection is greatly skewed towards areas of low economic value and is not representative of the relative conservation value of landscapes that differ in their environments and degree of forest cover. Forest cover in the majority of New Zealand landscapes has been reduced below the level of an expected extinction threshold of 30 % forest cover in the landscape, and ongoing deforestation threatens to force more landscapes below the critical threshold. Deforestation is still occurring across the country, and it is concerning that current deforestation rates in some areas are far greater than those observed in tropical, developing nations. I showed that the remaining forest fragments in New Zealand have complex, irregular shapes, and find ubiquitous evidence that core habitats within individual fragments are spatially discontinuous, comprising multiple, disjunct cores of small average area. Because population density of forest-interior species typically decreases with decreasing habitat area, multiple, disjunct cores support a lower total population size than a single, discrete core of the same total area. I found in a spatially explicit, landscape-level analysis of habitat fragmentation in New Zealand that simple core-area models consistently overestimate the carrying capacity of habitat fragments. Habitat fragmentation and habitat destruction are widely recognised as two of the leading threats to the continued maintenance of global biodiversity. The effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity fall into five categories that describe the spatial and landscape attributes of fragmented ecosystems; (1) fragment area, (2) edge effects, (3) fragment shape, (4) fragment isolation, and (5) matrix structure. Each attribute affects species individually according to their particular biological requirements and life history strategies, leading to complex, and often conflicting, sets of results in the empirical literature. Furthermore, it is now apparent that the effects of fragmentation can take many decades to become apparent and that the spatial arrangement of habitat fragments can interact with other ecological processes to magnify the detrimental impacts of fragmentation on species. I synthesised the published effects of habitat fragmentation on the morphology, distribution and abundance of invertebrate populations, species and communities, and present examples of time lags and synergies from the fragmentation literature. I explicitly considered the underlying mechanisms determining the responses ofindividuals to fragmentation and discussed the role of species traits in determining species vulnerability to changes in the spatial attributes of fragmented landscapes. I sampled 35,461 beetles from a fragmented forest and matrix system in New Zealand over very large gradients of fragment area (10-2 to 106 ha) and edge distances (up to 1,024 m from the forest edge into both the forest and the adjacent matrix interiors). The beetle fauna was very diverse, with 893 species identified in 65 families, representing nearly 20 % of the known species in New Zealand. Beetle communities were strongly structured by forest fragmentation, but in species-specific ways. Distance to edge was consistently shown to have the largest effect on community composition, but, surprisingly, an interaction between area and distance to edge had a stronger impact on community structure than fragment area alone. I developed a new method to partition the variance in community composition that was explained by putative area and edge effects. The method uses backwards stepwise regression to determine significant predictors of gradients in beetle species composition that were identified by canonical ordination. I found that edge effects were driven partially by small-scale alterations to microhabitat and microclimate and partially by changes in landscape composition that varied with distance to edge. In contrast, fragment area effects were driven primarily by edge effects, the strength of which varied significantly with fragment area. I took a novel approach to characterising the responses of 185 common species to habitat edges by modelling species abundances across edges with a general logistic model that described sigmoid trends in abundance for forest specialist and matrix specialist species, as well as unimodal trends in abundance for edge specialist species. I used the second derivatives of the logistic and unimodal models to statistically determine the width of species response zones to edge effects. Beetle species responses to forest edges occurred over far greater scales than previously suspected, with edge response zones for some species extending for more than 1 km. Average edge response zones were 194 m wide and, for many species, began in the forest but extended into the adjacent matrix. Species were categorised according to their responses to fragment area and distance to edge. Closely related species were expected to be placed in similar response categories because they are predicted to share suites of traits that determine their susceptibility or resilience to fragmentation by virtue of common ancestry. Despite many species exhibiting responses that could be grouped into categories, individual species responses to fragmentation were largely idiosyncratic with even closely related species exhibiting strongly contrasting responses to fragmentation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deforestation</field><field name="subject">forest fragmentation</field><field name="subject">arthropod biodiversity</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological distress in couples coping with cancer: the influence of social support and attachment</field><field name="creator">Trewin, Bronwyn Heather</field><field name="description">The current study examined psychological distress in couples coping with a cancer diagnosis. Although it is widely recognised that spouses coping with a cancer diagnosis are at risk of psychological distress, debate exists within the literature regarding the amount of distress experienced by individuals, and about who is most at risk. Fifty-five couples coping with a cancer diagnosis completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, social support and attachment style characteristics. Results indicated that partners psychological distress levels were more influenced by social support and attachment characteristics than patients were. Partners of those with cancer, who were higher on the insecure attachment dimensions, perceived providing and receiving less support and were less satisfied with support overall compared to less insecure partners. In addition to this, partner social support was significantly related to psychological distress, and attachment style was found to moderate this relationship. Specifically, partners were more vulnerable to psychological distress when they were higher on the insecure attachment dimensions and when support satisfaction was low or when they had a perception of low support receipt. Contrary to expectations, there were no significant findings for the patient group.

The resulting tectonics contain a variety of structures caused by the way these patterns overlap, creating complexities on the regional and individual feature scale. An unpublished map by Jongens et al. (1999) shows the Ashley-Loburn Fault System crossing the plains from the east connected with the Springfield Thrust Fault in the western margins, possibly the southern limit of the east-west trending strikeslip activity. Of note are two hill structures inferred to be affected by this fault system. View Hill to the west, is on the south side of this fault junction, and Starvation Hill further east, was shown lying on the north side of a left stepover restraining bend. During thrust uplift and simple tilting of the View Hill structure, at least two uplift events post date last Pleistocene aggradation accounting for variations in scarp morphology. Broad constraints on fault dip and the age of the displacement surface suggest that slip-rates are in the order of 0.5 mm/year. East from View Hill, the strike-slip fault was originally thought to curve northeast, around the southeast of Starvation Hill. But there is neither evidence of a scarp, nor other clear evidence of surface faulting at Starvation Hill, which poses the question of the extent to which folding may reflect both fault geometry and fault activity. Starvation Hill is a triangular shape, with a series of distinctive smooth, semi-planar surfaces, lapping across both sides of the hill at a range of elevations and gradients. These surfaces are thought to be remnants of old river channels, and are indicative of tilting and upwarping of the hill structure. 3D computer modelling of these surfaces, combined with studies of the cover sequence on the hill, resulted in inferences being drawn as to the location of hinge lines of a dual-hinged anticline and an overview of the tectonic history of the hill. This illustrates the potential to apply topographical and geomorphic studies to the evolution of geometrically complex structures Starvation Hill is interpreted to be the result of two fault-generated folds, one fault trending north, the other, more recent fault, trending east. These two faults are thought to be sequentially developed segments of the original fault zone inferred by Jongens et al. (1999) but with reinterpreted location and mechanism detail. The presence of two faults has resulted in overprinted differential uplift of the structure, which has been significantly degraded, especially in the southwest corner of the hill. The majority of the formation of the northerly trending structure of Starvation Hill is inferred to be pre-Otiran, with uplift of the later east trending structure continuing into the late Pleistocene and Holocene.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strike-slip faults</field><field name="subject">thrust</field><field name="subject">tectonics</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Starvation Hill</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and mode of action of NPPB and related compounds</field><field name="creator">Muto, Yukiyo</field><field name="description">5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) was normally recognised as a Cl- channel inhibitor, but its specificity is in question, since an inhibitory effect against K&#8314; channels has been reported. To identify the significance of the molecules structural components, NPPB and related compounds, such as 2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (PPAB), 5- nitro-2-heptylamino benzoic acid (HANB) and 2-nitro-5-heptylamino benzoic acid (HANB-2) were synthesised by reductive amination using various aldehydes and amines. Using internodal cells of the giant green Characean algae, Nitella hookeri, the effects of NPPB and related compounds on cytoplasmic streaming and turgor regulation were determined. Previous experiments stated that cytoplasmic streaming was sensitive to NPPB, PPAB and HANB with IC&#8325;&#8320; values of 24&#181;mol/L, 455&#181;mol/L, and 6.4mmol/L, respectively. In this report, the IC&#8325;&#8320; values of purchased NPPB and niflumic acid were found to be 88.65&#181;mol/L and 121.82&#181;mol/L, respectively. Although the IC&#8325;&#8320; value of purchased NPPB showed a slight difference from that of synthesised NPPB, the results of the cytoplasmic streaming experiment indicated the possibility of this analysis to be a simple assay system for analysing the effects of structural modification to ion channel inhibitors on their biological activity. Moreover, NPPB and PPAB seem to stimulate regulation of turgor pressure under hyperosmotic shock, which can be explained by a blockage of K&#8314; efflux during osmotic stress leading to faster recovery of turgor regulation. Additionally, the results of cytosolic free Ca&#178;&#8314; analysis using aequorin technology also suggested that the possibility of this analysis to be used as a more direct measure of the inhibitory effect, while the cytoplasmic streaming analysis is a more indirect method.

Mitochondrial disorders have been identified to be associated with mtDNA mutations. However, the molecular mechanisms of specific mtDNA mutations are still being explored in order to establish causative links. This study tries to elucidate the mutational effects of mtDNA on OXPHOS complex activities and cell growths. Using mouse 3T3 fibroblasts as a cell model, single-cell clones with different growth rates were isolated. The entire mtDNA genome was sequenced for mutations. The enzymatic activities of OXPHOS complex I to V were analysed. Three growth patterns represented by five clones were identified. Three clones (clone #2, #3, and #6) had the shortest doubling times (11.5 - 14.9 hours). Clone #1 had a medium growth rate (19.2 hous); and clone #5 had a significantly slow growth rate (22 hours). MtDNA sequencing results revealed that clone #5 had several heteroplasmic mutations (one in 16S rRNA, two in tRNAser (UCN), three in tRNAasp, one in tRNAlys, one in COI, five in COII, and one in ATPase8) while the other four clones showed sequence homology. Enzymatic analyses showed that on average clone #5 had significantly low complex III, IV, and V activities (p &lt; 0.05). Changes in biochemical properties and protein structure were analyzed to deduct possible mechanisms for reduced respiration. In conclusion, the slow growth rate is associated with reduced OXPHOS enzyme functions. It is most likely that the combination of COI and COII mutations resulted in the reduction of complex IV function. It is still unclear whether the ATPase8 mutation (T7869A) in the non-conserved region alone can have such a pronounced phenotypic effect. A reduction in complex III also cannot be explained since there were no mutations in the only mtDNA-encoded complex III gene, but it is possible that there are mutations in the nDNA-encoded complex III genes. Mutations in tRNA and rRNA genes may also be responsible for reduced protein syntheses and consequently reduced OXPHOS activities. It is unclear why complex I activity was not affected. Although the mutational effect of individual mtDNA mutation observed cannot be clearly identified, this study establishes a correlation between mtDNA mutation and cell energy production and growth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mitochondrial</field><field name="subject">genomes</field><field name="subject">DNA replication</field><field name="subject">cell culture</field><field name="subject">clone</field><field name="subject">mutations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic mode identification in a sample of non-radially pulsating stars</field><field name="creator">Wright, Duncan John</field><field name="description">This thesis has analysed spectroscopic data for three stars in detail, the &#946; Cephei star V2052 Ophiuchus, the &#947; Doradus star QW Puppis and the &#947; Doradus candidate star HD139095.

The orbital periods of these systems range from about 10 days to 26 years, with a median of about 6 years. Orbital solutions were determined for the seven systems with shorter periods. The measurement of the mass ratio of the longest-period system, HD217166, demonstrates that this important astrophysical quantity can be estimated in a model-free manner with less than 10% of the orbital cycle observed spectroscopically.\\ Single-lined orbital solutions have been derived for five of the binaries. Two of these systems are astrometric binaries: &#946; Ret and &#957; Oct. The other SB1 systems were 94 Aqr A, &#952; Ant, and the 10-day system, HD159656. The preliminary spectroscopic solution for &#952; Ant (P~18 years), is the first one derived for this system. The improvement to the precision achieved for the elements of the other four systems was typically between 1--2 orders of magnitude. The very high precision with which the spectroscopic solution for HD159656 has been measured should allow an investigation into possible apsidal motion in the near future. In addition to the variable radial velocity owing to its orbital motion, the K-giant, &#957; Oct, has been found to have an additional long-term irregular periodicity, attributed, for the time being, to the rotation of a large surface feature.\\ Double-lined solutions were obtained for HD206804 (K7V+K7V), which previously had two competing astrometric solutions but no spectroscopic solution, and a newly discovered seventh-magnitude system, HD181958 (F6V+F7V). This latter system has the distinction of having components and orbital characteristics whose study should be possible with present ground-based interferometers. All eight of the binary systems have had their mass ratio and the masses of their components estimated.\\ The following comments summarize the motivation for getting these results, and the manner in which the research was carried out. \\ The majority of stars exist in binary systems rather than singly as does the Sun. These systems provide astronomers with the most reliable and proven means to determine many of the fundamental properties of stars. One of these properties is the stellar mass, which is regarded as being the most important of all, since most other stellar characteristics are very sensitive to the mass. Therefore, empirical masses, combined with measurements of other stellar properties, such as radii and luminosities, are an excellent test for competing models of stellar structure and evolution.\\ Binary stars also provide opportunities to observe and investigate many extraordinary astrophysical processes that do not occur in isolated stars. These processes often arise as a result of direct and indirect interactions between the components, when they are sufficiently close to each other. Some of the interactions are relatively passive, such as the circularization of the mutual orbits, whilst others result from much more active processes, such as mass exchange leading to intense radiation emissions. \\ A complete understanding of a binary system's orbital characteristics, as well as the measurement of the all-important stellar masses, is almost always only achieved after the binary system has been studied using two or more complementary observing techniques. Two of the suitable techniques are astrometry and spectroscopy. In favourable circumstances, astrometry can deduce the angular dimensions of the orbit, the total mass of the system, and sometimes, its distance from us. Spectroscopy, on the other hand, can determine the linear scale of the orbit and the ratio of the stellar masses, based on the changing radial velocities of both stars. When a resolved astrometric orbital solution is also available, the velocities of both stars can allow the binary system's parallax to be determined, and the velocities of one star can provide a measure of the system mass ratio.\\ Unfortunately, relatively few binary systems are suited to these complementary studies. Underlying this difficulty are the facts that, typically, astrometrically-determined orbits favour those with periods of years or decades, whereas spectroscopic orbital solutions are more often measured for systems with periods of days to months. With the development of high-resolution astrometric and spectroscopic techniques in recent years, it is hoped that many more binary systems will be amenable to these complementary strategies.\\ Several months after this thesis began, a high-resolution spectrograph, HERCULES, commenced operations at the Mt John University Observatory, to be used in conjuction with the 1-metre McLellan telescope. For late-type stars, the anticipated velocity precision was &#8818;10 ms&#8315;&#185;. The primary goals of this thesis were: 1.~to assess the performance of HERCULES and the related reduction software that subsequently followed, 2.~to carry out an observational programme of 20 or so binary systems, and 3.~to determine the orbital and stellar parameters which characterize some of these systems. The particular focus was on those binaries that have resolved or unresolved astrometric orbital solutions, which therefore may be suited to complementary investigations.\\ HERCULES was used to acquire spectra of the programme stars, usually every few weeks, over a timespan of about three years. High-resolution spectra were acquired for the purpose of measuring precise radial velocities of the stars. When possible, orbital solutions were derived from these velocities, using the method of differential corrections.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">radial velocity</field><field name="subject">binary stars</field><field name="subject">cross-correlation</field><field name="subject">thorium-argon spectra</field><field name="subject">stellar properties</field><field name="subject">differential corrections</field><field name="subject">orbital motion</field><field name="subject">HD23817</field><field name="subject">HD84367</field><field name="subject">HD159656</field><field name="subject">HD181958</field><field name="subject">HD217166</field><field name="subject">HD206804</field><field name="subject">HD205478</field><field name="subject">HD219834</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial patterning of Hieracium pilosella invaded short tussock grasslands.</field><field name="creator">Dickinson, Yvette L.</field><field name="description">Hieracium pilosella is an invasive weed of New Zealand's short tussock grasslands. Since the 1960s, the abundance of H. pilosella has dramatically increased; it is now thought to occur in 6 million hectares of New Zealand (Espie, 2001), predominantly in grasslands. It is at least common in 42% of this area (Espie, 2001). Ecology is inherently spatial and as plants closely interact with their direct neighbours, the spatial arrangement of plants is vital to their functioning. A handful of recently published articles have implicated spatial structure of plant communities in theories of plant competition, resource use and the invasion of plant communities. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) determine if there are consistent spatial patterns in New Zealand's short tussock grasslands at relatively small scales (i.e. spatial relationships between individuals); 2) investigate how the invasion of H. pilosella may be altering these spatial patterns; and 3) establish if the spatial patterns of species, life-forms and root systems are being altered in different ways. Spatial patterns of both tussock and inter-tussock species, life-forms and root functional groups were evaluated at a range of short tussock grassland sites across a gradient of H. pilosella invasion levels in Canterbury, using both join-count statistics and Ripley's K-function. A classification system for the root functional groups of vascular species in these communities was developed and applied. It was found that species, life-forms and root functional groups in short tussock grasslands had generally consistent spatial patterns across sites both within and between species. These patterns were variable between significantly different levels of H. pilosella ground cover. The type of spatial pattern exhibited, and the way it was altered differed between species, life-form and root functional groups. For example, tussocks exhibited increased regularity up to scales of 160 cm and increasing aggregation at scales up to 500 cm, with increases in H. pilosella abundance. In contrast, both Agrostis capillaris and herbaceous chamaephytes had increased aggregation across scales up to 160 cm. These differences in spatial patterns along the gradient of invasion are a strong indication that H. pilosella is structurally fragmenting New Zealand's short tussock grasslands. This fragmentation is likely to have far reaching effects including the disturbance of invertebrate communities and the disruption of ecosystem services including pollination, vegetation regeneration, and nutrient cycling.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hieracium pilosella</field><field name="subject">Spatial ecology</field><field name="subject">Tussock grasslands</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the ecology, growth and dispersal behaviour of Heterozius rotundifrons A. Milne Edwards, 1867 (Brachyura: belliidae)</field><field name="creator">Snell, Philip T. R.</field><field name="description">H.rotundifrons A. Milne Edwards, 1867, the big-handed crab, belongs to the Belliidae and is the only crab representative of this family in New Zealand. It lives in the intertidal zone. The megalopae undergo 13-16 moults to become fully mature at a size of 11-13mm CWo These mature crabs live up to a maximum of 19 years and attain a size of 23-25mm CW (24-26 instars). The laboratory growth curve of H.rotundifrons is asymptotic and there is no terminal ecdysis. Growth is similar between the sexes up to maturity but decreases more in males after puberty thus exhibiting an "anomalous" pattern. Average weight gain after ecdysis was found to be same for both sexes and independent of size (approx. 18%). Environmental and physical factors which normally affect growth have no profound effect on H.rotundifrons. However, moult frequency was found to be increased by removal of eyestalks or when crabs were maintained in constant darkness. Starvation and limb removal considerably reduced the moult increment. Alpha ecdysone concentration increased to a peak 40 days before ecdys is and returned to base 1eve1s at moulting. Moulting is seasonal having a high peak in mid-summer and a smaller peak in April-May. A field study of dispersal showed that short-range movements (5.06m), within the intertidal zone, are common for H.rotundifrons (n=212). Many crabs left their refuge between low tides and their movements were independent of one another. Neither home range nor long dispersal movement (&gt;21m) have been observed in H.rotundifrons. Diet of H.rotundifrons comprised algae (60.7%), crustaceans (19.6%), sand &amp; unidentified materials (11.7%), sponges &amp; worms (5.7%), and molluscs (2.3%). Although brown algae were always the single dominant food item, diet composition varied seasonally. The majority of the population at Kaikoura (602(M):858(F)) consisted of pre-pubertal males and females and fewer post-pubertal males were found than post-pubertal females, a reflection of slower male growth and suggesting higher male mortality.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterozius rotundifrons</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">dispersal behaviour</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">big handed crab</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of predation as a limiting factor ofbellbird (Anthornis melanurai) nest success in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Poirot, Ceisha Iana</field><field name="description">Nest success, feeding behavior and anti-predator strategies, were studied to determine if bellbirds (Anthornis melanura) are limited by predation and if pest control can relieve the pressures of predation so that food supply may become a limiting factor for bellbirds. The nest success of bellbirds at the Rotoiti Nature Recovery Project (RNRP), Nelson Lakes, New Zealand (2002-2004 breeding seasons) was compared with data from other bellbird nest success studies in New Zealand. Two years of nest monitoring resulted in a low overall nest success at the RNRP (39 %), an area low in predator density, compared with 16.4 - 67.2 % found for other sites. One-way anova comparisons between the nest success of bellbirds in areas grouped by predator density (absent, low and high) were not significantly different. Regression analyses of nest success versus predator density (stoat or rat tracking indicies) were also not significant. A test of change in bellbird numbers (numbers in February/numbers in November in the same breeding season) versus rat density (tracking index in November) showed no significant trend at the RNRP. A test of density dependence (change in bellbird numbers versus numbers in November) was also not significant. The percent of time bellbirds spent feeding was significantly higher at the RNRP compared to Mt. Misery (Nelson Lakes, New Zealand) during the breeding season only (RNRP = 34 % and Mt. Misery = 23 %). The percent of time bellbirds spent foraging for food was also significantly higher at the RNRP compared to Mt. Misery during the breeding seasons (RNRP = 47 % and Mt. Misery = 36 %). This suggests that predator control at the RNRP has allowed bellbird numbers to increase so that nesting success may be partly limited by food supply during the breeding season. However, despite higher densities of bellbird and other bird species at the RNRP, there was no difference in the percent of time spent feeding (RNRP = 36.7 % and Mt. Misery = 36.3 %) or foraging (RNRP = 49 % and Mt. Misery = 51 %) between the RNRP and Mt. Misery during winter months The nest height of bellbirds was not significantly related to the nest outcome (excluding nests that failed due to non-predation causes) at either the RNRP or Kowhai Bush. Nest predation occurred at a range of heights, which suggests introduced predators are not specialists at any nest height. Bellbirds at the RNRP 111 visited their nests more frequently and stayed for shorter periods at the nest compared with bellbirds at the Cheeseman Valley, consistent with the hypothesis bellbirds alter their behavior to avoid disclosing their nest position. The results of this study, although not significant, do indicate that bellbird nest success is limited by high densities of predators. One-way anova analysis on nest success during the feeding stage was nearly significant (P = 0.096). Regression analysis trend lines show an increased negative effect on nest success at higher predator densities. Few replicates and large variation in nesting success within treatments affect the power of the results. Bellbirds may persist in areas with high predator densities due to anti-predator strategies when visiting their nests. With pest control, ecosystem interactions may be revitalized so that limiting factors other than predation become important for bellbird nest success.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bellbird</field><field name="subject">Anthornis melanura</field><field name="subject">nesting</field><field name="subject">nests</field><field name="subject">predation</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Properties of Ice at the IceCube Neutrino Telescope</field><field name="creator">Whitehead, Samuel Robert</field><field name="description">The IceCube Neutrino Telescope is designed to detect high energy neutrinos with a large array of photomultiplier tubes placed deep within the Antarctic ice. The way that light propagates through the ice needs to be modelled accurately to enable the paths of charged particles to be reconstructed from the distribution of their Cerenkov radiation. Light travelling through even the purest of ice will undergo scattering and absorption processes, however the ice in which IceCube is embedded has optical properties that vary significantly with depth which need to be accurately modelled. Currently, simulation of the muon background using the current ice model is unable to fully replicate experimental data. In this thesis we investigate a potential method of improving on the current generation of ice models. We introduce thin, highly absorbing layers into the current description of the detection medium and investigate the effect on the simulation of muon tracks in IceCube. We find that better agreement between simulation and data can be seen in the occupancy of optical modules, through the introduction of such absorptive layers into the existing ice layers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IceCube</field><field name="subject">ice properties</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">South Pole</field><field name="subject">dust layers</field><field name="subject">optical properties</field><field name="subject">light propagation</field><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population mixing and the geographical epidemiology of childhood leukaemia and type 1 diabetes in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Miller, Laura Jean</field><field name="description">Over the past twenty years the incidence of both childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and type 1 diabetes have risen in many developed countries, including New Zealand. Although the explanations for this increase and the precise aetiology of both diseases remain unclear, environmental factors are thought to be important. One factor receiving increasing attention is the role of infections introduced through population mixing. However, previous studies on this topic show mixed results and population mixing itself tends to be under-theorised. Furthermore, this issue has not been adequately assessed in New Zealand, a country characterised by high levels of population mobility. In this research, a variety of population mixing measures for small areas in New Zealand were developed. National data on ALL registrations were obtained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry, and regional type 1 diabetes data were obtained from the Canterbury Diabetes Register for the Canterbury Region of the South Island. The analyses were undertaken in three stages. First, standardised incidence ratios of each disease were examined at different geographical and temporal scales, between areas of differing socioeconomic status, and in urban and rural New Zealand. Second, cluster analysis was employed to test for spatial-temporal clustering of the two diseases. Finally, multivariate regression analyses were utilised to investigate the association between each disease and the various measures of population mixing at the area-level. The results reveal similarities in the geographical epidemiology of childhood ALL and type 1 diabetes in New Zealand. The majority of the findings were suggestive of an infectious aetiology for both diseases. In addition, higher incidence of both diseases was observed in areas which increased the most in population mixing over short time periods (6/7 years). Furthermore, raised type 1 diabetes incidence was also associated with high population mixing in early life.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Population mixing</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">child health</field><field name="subject">leukaemia</field><field name="subject">type 1 diabetes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Geomorphological and Sedimentological Investigation into the Glacial Deposits of the Lake Clearwater Basin, Mid Canterbury, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Evans, Michael Douglas</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of a combined geomorphological, sedimentological and geochronological investigation into the glacial history of the Clearwater Basin, Mid Canterbury, New Zealand. The study demonstrates that a thick wedge of glacial and paraglacial sediments are preserved in the valley. These are &gt;100m thick and preserve evidence of at least 3 glacial phases (&gt;180ka). The study presents a new and detailed geomorphology map for the Clearwater valley and adjacent areas and has added 17 new recessional positions to the local glacial record. Surface Exposure Dating (SED) has been used to directly date the moraines of the Clearwater Basin providing the first detailed chronology for glacial moraine in this area. In total 31 cosmogenic ages from 9 separate moraines are presented. The results demonstrate that the LGM advance is the Trinity moraine of Mabin (1980) and not the Hakatere moraine as previously assumed and that the LGM was achieved at or about 23ka. The Clearwater glacier receded up valley between 23 and 13ka with some indication of accelerated retreat after c.16ka.

There is evidence that the rightmost digits, or endings, of retail prices can communicate meanings to consumers. Some researchers (Schindler and Kirby, 1997; Stiving and Winer, 1997; Thomas and Morwitz, 2005) argued that there are two price ending effects level effects (those effects in which consumers may underestimate the price); and image effects (those effects in which consumers may infer meaning from the right-hand digits). In the study, ninety-three participants were recruited from the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. All participants were given questionnaires to rate the quality and necessity-luxury of the good first; then a distraction session which used for distracting participants' attention from memorizing the prices of the goods; then a recall-test was given. Participants gave significantly different ratings for luxuries and necessities according to the different price-endings.

Retrieving these aerosol properties becomes increasingly more difficult under aerosol background conditions, when tiny particles (&#171; 0.1 &#181;m) prevail, to which the experiment is nearly or entirely insensitive. A successful retrieval algorithm must then be able (a) to fill the 'blind spot' with suitable information about the practically invisible particles, and (b) to identify 'the best' of many possible solutions. The OE approach differs from other previously used aerosol retrieval techniques by taking a statistical approach to the multiple solution problem, in which the entire range of possible solutions are considered (including the smallest particles) and characterized by probability density functions. The three main parts of this thesis are (1) the development of the new OE retrieval algorithm, (2) the validation of this algorithm on the basis of synthetic extinction data, and (3) application of the new algorithm to SAGE II measurements of stratospheric background aerosol. The validation results indicate that the new method is able to retrieve the particle size of typical background aerosols reasonably well, and that the retrieved uncertainties are a good estimate of the true errors. The derived surface area densities (A), and volume densities (V ) tend to be closer to the correct solutions than the directly retrieved number density (N), median radius (R), and lognormal distribution width (S). Aerosol properties as retrieved from SAGE II measurements (recorded in 1999) are observed to be close to correlative in situ data. In many cases the OE and in situ data agree within the (OE and/or the in situ ) uncertainties. The retrieved error estimates are of the order of 69% (&#963;N), 33% (&#963;R), 14% (&#963;S), 23% (&#963;A), 12% (&#963;V), and 13% (&#963;Reff ). The OE number densities are generally larger, and the OE median particle sizes are generally smaller than those N and R retrieved by Bingen et al. (2004a), who suggest that their results underestimate (N) or overestimate (R) correlative in situ data due to the 'small particle problem'. The OE surface area estimates are generally closer to correlative in situ profiles (courtesy of T. Deshler, University of Wyoming), and larger than Principal Component Analysis (PCA) retrieval solutions of A (courtesy of L. W. Thomason, NASA LaRC) that have been observed to underestimate correlative in situ data by 40-50%. These observations suggest that the new OE retrieval algorithm is a successful approach to the aerosol retrieval problem, which is able to add to the current knowledge by improving current estimates of aerosol properties in the lower stratosphere under low aerosol loading conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerosol size distribution</field><field name="subject">optimal estimation</field><field name="subject">Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment</field><field name="subject">lower stratosphere</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of body image, body mass index and self-esteem to eating attitudes in a normal sample</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Chloe Laurel France</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine how body image, Body Mass Index (BMI), self-esteem and eating attitudes were related in a non-clinical sample of New Zealand women. The sample consisted of 36 women ranging in age from 17 to 55 years of age. Body image was assessed using the Body Shape Questionnaire, BMI was calculated based on measures of height and weight; eating attitudes was assessed with the Eating Concern subscale of the Eating Disorders Examination and self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The results of this study conclude that elevated BMI is associated with higher dissatisfaction with body image, and there is a positive correlation between body image and eating attitudes. Self-esteem and eating attitudes were significantly correlated with lower self-esteem being associated with increased disturbance in eating attitudes. Self-esteem and BMI were found to significantly contribute to eating attitudes on their own as well as together. Body image on its own also made a significant contribution to eating attitudes. Previous research informs us of the negative implications of dissatisfaction with body image, elevated BMI, disturbed eating attitudes and low-self-esteem and this study examines the links between these variables in order to add further information to what contributes to each of the variables.

Research in student clinician populations has found that supervisees value interpersonal, personal and teaching characteristics in a clinical supervisor. Research has also shown that perceptions of supervisor characteristics change as student clinicians gain clinical skills. However, there is a significant lack of research examining practising clinicians' perceptions of clinical supervisor characteristics. The current study aimed to 1) survey practising Speech Language Therapists (SLTs) and examine the knowledge, skills and attitudes valued in a clinical supervisor, and 2) determine if the characteristics valued by more experienced SLTs (greater than 5 years) differed from those valued by less experienced SLTs (less than 5 years). A cross-sectional survey design methodology was employed. A five-part survey was developed, and distributed nationally by email. Participants were 72 SLTs practising in New Zealand. Results indicated that practising SLTs valued interpersonal knowledge and skills, and personal values and attitudes most highly in a clinical supervisor. In addition, it was found that characteristics relating to professional knowledge and identity were least valued. Overall, almost no difference was found between characteristics valued by less and more experienced clinicians. Findings suggest that practicing clinicians' basic human-relationship needs must be met for safe and effective CS to occur. Findings also suggest that regardless of experience level all clinicians are learners. This means clinicians across all different levels of work experience require support from clinical supervisors, to learn reflectively from experiences in the workplace.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical supervision</field><field name="subject">supervisor characteristics</field><field name="subject">speech language therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early intervention for stealing: Interrupting the antisocial trajectory</field><field name="creator">McPhail, Lorna May</field><field name="description">This study investigated the effectiveness of the Triple P Programme to reduce stealing behaviour in three preadolescent children.

MM5-CAMx4 and WRF-CAMx4 numerical modelling systems were utilized to air circulation over the complex terrain of the Christchurch area for investigation applied to winter aerosol pollution, following the recent establishment and implementation of the National Environmental Standards. A new method using several different chemical scenarios is developed to calculate optimal chemical composition of the input gridded aerosol emissions. This method improves the accuracy of predicted PM concentrations. The MM5-CAMx4.2 numerical system is evaluated to predict aerosol concentrations over a 48-72 hour time period for Christchurch for winter 2005. The aerosol concentrations are obtained for four different chemical compositions of the input aerosol emissions. The fine-total PM regression error between observed and modelled aerosol is used to find the minimum difference between modelled and ambient aerosol. Combination of the chemical scenarios with the minimum error between modelled and ambient data is employed to create a new complex chemical scenario. A reduction of the systematic error in the scenario method is achieved by applying the MM5/WRF - CAMx4.2 numerical system and observations for winter 2006, aerosol data from 2 observation sites. Assessment of the efficiency of PM abatement strategies for the period 2005- 2013 is undertaken using winter 2005 meteorology and application of a linear reduction in emissions according to Environment Canterbury proposed plan for aerosol reduction. A new numerical approach to selection of PM monitoring sites optimal localisation is also developed and could be applied to any air pollutant to find the optimal positions for installing new observation sites.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When and why does female dieting become pernicious?

Participants completed questionnaires assessing self and relationship functioning, dieting levels and eating disordered attitudes, and weight-loss support frequency and helpfulness, in both a cross-sectional and longitudinal study. As predicted, a) higher levels of unhealthy dieting were significantly related to more negative views of the self (e.g., lower self-esteem), and b) lower perceived levels of support from the partner were significantly related to higher levels of eating-disordered attitudes, anxious attachment, and lower relationship satisfaction. However, testing more complex causal models showed that self-esteem played a pivotal role. First, tests confirmed that the impact of self-esteem on unhealthy dieting was mediated by more disordered attitudes to eating. Second, those with low-self-esteem were much less likely to diet in an unhealthy fashion with more frequent and positive partner support, whereas high self-esteem women were not influenced by the support offered by their partners. These findings did not apply to the frequency of healthy dieting, with the important exception that more frequent partner support encouraged healthier dieting, and they held up when plausible third variables were statistically controlled. The findings suggest that dieting behaviour is influenced both by individual differences and the nature of support in intimate relationship contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dieting</field><field name="subject">eating disorders</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">couples</field><field name="subject">intimate relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Patterns of Mitochondrial DNA Inheritance Using New Zealand Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) as a Model Organism</field><field name="creator">Wolff, Jonci Nikolai</field><field name="description">The laws for the inheritance of animal mitochondrial DNA differ from those revealed for nuclear DNA. In contrast to nuclear genes, animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is predominantly inherited through the maternal line and is typically assumed to be nonrecombining. The absence of both paternal transmission (hereafter: paternal leakage) and heterologous recombination of mtDNA are assumed to be key characteristics of mitochondrial DNA inheritance, which has enabled evolutionary models to be much simpler than those needed for the interpretation of nuclear DNA. However, recent revelations of paternal leakage in the animal kingdom challenge our current knowledge about mtDNA inheritance and the utility of mtDNA as a molecular marker. The occurrence of paternal leakage potentially introduces new haplotypes into populations and therefore impacts on the interpretation of mtDNA analysis. To date, it is unclear whether the documented cases of paternal leakage are exceptions to the general rule or if these events occur more frequently than so far believed. If this event occurred at a measurable frequency, it is vital to implement such data into models of mtDNA evolution to improve the accuracy at which evolutionary relationships and times of divergence are estimated. In this thesis, I aimed to provide an insight into the broader patterns of mtDNA inheritance using chinook salmon as a model organism. I first sought to delimit the frequency of paternal leakage in chinook salmon and further investigated two major mechanisms which are believed to limit paternal leakage: The many-fold dilution of paternal mtDNA by maternal mtDNA upon fertilization and the genetic bottleneck mtDNA is believed to be exposed to during early developmental stages. A screen of roughly 10.000 offspring did not reveal the presence of paternal mtDNA within these samples delimiting the maximum frequency of paternal leakage in this system to 0.18% (power of 0.95) and 0.27% (power of 0.99), suggesting that the occurrence of paternal leakage is most likely an exception to the general rule. To infer the dilution of paternal mtDNA upon fertilization, I employed real-time PCR and determined the mtDNA content of salmon spermatozoa and oocytes to be 5.73 &#177; 2.28 and 3.15x109 &#177; 9.98x108 molecules per gamete, respectively. Accordingly, the estimated ratio of paternal to maternal mtDNA in zygotes is 1:7.35x108 &#177; 4.67x108. This estimate is 3 to 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the ratio revealed for mammals. Consequently, and if the dilution acts as an efficient barrier against the transmission of paternal mtDNA, paternal inheritance of mtDNA per offspring will be much less likely in this system than in mammals. To estimate at what probability the diminutive contribution of paternal mtDNA in zygotes is potentially inherited to offspring, I determined the size of the bottleneck acting on mtDNA during both embryogenesis and oogensis by examining the transmission of mtDNA variants to offspring and oocytes within a pedigree of heteroplasmic individuals. The number of segregating units (mtDNAs) between a mother&#8217;s somatic tissue and oocytes was estimated to be 109.3 (median = 109.3; 62.4 &lt; NeOog &lt; 189.6; 95% confidence interval) and from a mother&#8217;s soma to offspring&#8217;s soma 105.4 (median = 105.4; 70.3 &lt; NeEmb &lt; 153.1; 95% confidence interval). Detected variances in allele frequency among oocytes were not significantly different from those in offspring, strongly suggesting that segregation of mtDNA occurs during oogenesis with its completion before oocyte maturation. However, considering a ratio of roughly 1:7.35x108 for paternal to maternal mtDNA in zygotes and that approximately 109.3 (NeOog) of the mitochondrial genomes present in zygotes are ultimately inherited to offspring, the probability for paternal mtDNA to be transmitted to offspring is in round terms 1.0x10-11/paternal mtDNA molecule. In summary, the results presented in this thesis document the presence of efficient barriers to prohibit the inheritance of minor allele contributions, such as paternal mtDNA, to offspring. These results strongly suggest that paternal leakage is an exception to the general rule. Furthermore, in comparison to studies undertaken in mammals, my results indicate that mechanisms in place to prevent paternal leakage may be unequally efficient among different animal taxa, reflecting differences in life traits, such as gamete morphology, gamete investment and reproductive strategies. Nonetheless, by the means of the dilution effect in zygotes and the genetic bottleneck during oogenesis, the occurrence of paternal leakage might be simply a quantitative phenomenon and cannot be excluded per se. The increasing number of documented cases of paternal leakage clarifies that its occurrence must be considered when applying mtDNA as a genetic marker. Furthermore, for species in which mtDNA inheritance can be confirmed to be purely random, theoretical frequencies of paternal leakage can be inferred and potentially implemented into models of mtDNA evolution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mtDNA inheritance</field><field name="subject">Q-PCR</field><field name="subject">gamete</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception of music for adult cochlear implant users: a questionnaire.</field><field name="creator">She, Jennifer Heep Kwan</field><field name="description">Existing music questionnaires have shown that postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant (CI) users generally find music to be less enjoyable following implantation. However, they did not investigate, in detail, which factors influence CI users&#8217; music listening enjoyment, nor did they examine the approach a music training program should take. In order to obtain such information, a questionnaire, the University of Canterbury Music Listening Questionnaire (UCMLQ), was developed. The UCMLQ investigated: (i) the effect of implantation on CI users&#8217; music listening enjoyment (determined by comparing the levels of enjoyment experienced post-implantation to prehearing loss, and just before implantation); (ii) the effect of a hearing aid in the unimplanted ear on CI users&#8217; music perception and appreciation; (iii) the effect of timbre on music listening enjoyment whereby respondents will be asked to rate the pleasantness and naturalness of common instruments and voices, and also, give ratings on the instruments&#8217; sound quality based on what they expect these instruments to sound to a person with normal hearing; (iv) whether respondents have a preference for a particular musical style (e.g. Country and Western, Jazz, Classical, etc); (v) whether respondents&#8217; have a preference for, firstly, low-pitched versus high-pitched instruments/voices; secondly, music with instruments-only, voice-only, or both instruments and voice; and lastly, music with smaller number of performers versus greater number of performers; (vi) practical methods or &#8216;tips&#8217; for enhancing everyday music listening enjoyment were collated; and finally, (vii) respondents were asked for their views and opinions on the content and logistics of a &#8216;take-home&#8217; MTP for improving their music listening enjoyment. One-hundred postlingually deafened adult CI users, ranging in age from 18 to 88 years (mean = 62.1, SD = 17.1), completed the UCMLQ. All respondents used a Nucleus CI24 implant and the ACE speech processing strategy. Results showed that following implantation, respondents generally found music to be less enjoyable but they also preferred certain types of instruments and music: (i) low-frequency instruments over high-frequency instruments; (ii) certain instruments (e.g. the guitar) over others (e.g. brass instruments); (iii) smaller numbers of performers as opposed to larger numbers; (iv) Country and Western music as opposed to Pop/Rock, Jazz, Classical-small group, and Classical-orchestra; and (v) music with a slow rhythm/beat, and words. A comparison of the ratings given by CI and Hearing Aid (CI+HA) users and CI-only users also revealed that CI+HA users felt that they were significantly more able to follow the melody-line of musical styles, identify these styles, and they also rated musical styles to sound significantly &#8216;more normal&#8217; than the CI-only users did. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups&#8217; (CI+HA users versus CI-only users) ratings for common instrumental sounds. In regards to respondents&#8217; interest in partaking in a &#8216;take-home&#8217; music training program (MTP), 54% of respondents stated that they would be interested in undertaking one. Respondents also indicated that the MTP should focus on improving their ability to recognise tunes, in particular, tunes known before implantation, and commonly-known tunes, and the MTP should offer a wide range of musical styles. In addition, training sessions should be of 30- minutes duration, 2 times per week, and the MTP should come in the form of a DVD with subtitles. Overall, this study collected information which not only helps us to better understand CI users&#8217; appreciation of music but also could be used in the shaping and development of a future MTP.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music perception</field><field name="subject">cochlear implants</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community assembly and food web interactions across pond permanence gradients</field><field name="creator">Greig, Hamish Stuart</field><field name="description">Ecological communities along gradients of environmental stress are thought to be structured by trade-offs between resisting biotic interactions in physically benign habitats and successfully exploiting physically stressful habitats. However, these trade-offs are likely to be affected by the predictability of abiotic stressors, and variation in the strength of biotic interactions. I investigated community assembly and food web interactions in ponds across an unpredictable gradient of water inundation (pond permanence) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Pond community composition and species richness were strongly influenced by pond permanence. However, species in temporary ponds were a nested subset of generalists that were also found in permanent ponds, rather than a unique assemblage of temporary pond specialists. Subsequent experiments indicated predator impact decreased with pond permanence, partially due to the foraging suppression of predatory invertebrates in permanent ponds by fish. Weak predation in permanent ponds combined with unpredictable drying regimes likely selected for generalist traits, and resulted in community assembly being driven by a gradient of drying stress rather than trade-offs between biotic interactions and drying. Furthermore, predator impact increased over time in temporary ponds. In predictable snow-melt ponds in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, seasonal windows of weak predation were exploited by vulnerable species, leading to increased diversity within habitats. However in unpredictable systems like Canterbury, temporal increases in predation risk that depend on drying history are likely to increase variability in the spatial arrangement of suitable habitats for particular species. This should further favour the evolution of generalist traits and reduce the importance of trade-offs between predation and drying in the assembly of communities. Considering the predictability of disturbance regimes and the spatial and temporal variation in biotic interactions will greatly enhance understanding and management of communities in heterogeneous landscapes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pond permanence</field><field name="subject">disturbance</field><field name="subject">trade-offs</field><field name="subject">life history evolution</field><field name="subject">food web interactions</field><field name="subject">metacommunity dynamics</field><field name="subject">predation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation of image counts with patient anatomy and development of a Monte Carlo simulation system for whole-body bone scans</field><field name="creator">McGurk, Ross James</field><field name="description">The optimisation of image quality in medical imaging techniques is a significant factor in favourable patient prognoses. The number of counts in a nuclear medicine image is one factor in determining the diagnostic value of the image. The current study aims to determine the variation in counts in whole-body bone scan images with patient height and weight. Three separate studies were undertaken as part of the investigation. First, 65 whole-body bone scans were analysed together with patient height, weight, age and sex. Weight was found to the most important anatomy influence on image counts. However, significant influences from patient sex and age meant that a useful relationship between image counts and patient anatomy based solely on height and weight could not be determined. For the second study, a model of General Electric Millennium MG gamma camera was created and validated within the SIMIND Monte Carlo software. The results indicate that the model is an accurate representation of the gamma camera. Third, the 4D NCAT whole-body patient phantom was modified to represent the average male and female clinical study participants. The phantoms were used in conjunction with the gamma camera model to simulate the whole-body bone scan procedure. The counts in the simulated images were consistent with the average measured counts of the clinical study indicating that it is feasible to use the NCAT phantom for nuclear medicine bone imaging. However, the phantom&#8217;s method of activity distribution should be refined to allow a more realistic distribution of activity throughout the skeleton.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monte Carlo modelling</field><field name="subject">nuclear imaging</field><field name="subject">whole body</field><field name="subject">gamma camera</field><field name="subject">anthropomorphic phantom</field><field name="subject">NCAT phantom</field><field name="subject">SIMIND</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural development of the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt in the Permian, Bryneira range, Western Otago, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Adamson, Thomas Keeley</field><field name="description">The deformed Permian Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt (DMOB) forms the basement of the Dun Mountain-Maitai terrane and is traceable through the entire length of New Zealand. The DMOB contains a variably serpentinised mantle portion and a crustal portion containing gabbros, dolerites, cross cutting dikes and extrusives, together they are similar to oceanic crust. The initial crustal portion, however, is atypical when compared to other ophiolites, being thin and lacking a sheeted dike complex, but has well spaced inclined intrusive sheets and sills. At least four post-Permian deformation periods affect the DMOB; collision and rotation during emplacement of the DMOB on the Gondwana margin, compression during Mesozoic orogenies, extensional deformation during the Gondwana break-up and transpressive deformation related to the modern plate boundary through New Zealand. Structural work in the Northern Bryneira Range focused on well preserved outcrops to investigate crustal growth and contemporaneous deformation during the Permian. Structural evidence of Permian deformation was determined by examination of pseudostratigraphy, structures constrainable to the Permian, and the geometric relationships with the overlying Maitai sedimentary sequence. Crosscutting by intrusive phases was used to determine a chronological order of crustal growth and deformation episodes. It was concluded that all deformation was extensional and that two major phases of magmatism were separated by a period of deformation and were followed by ongoing syn-sedimentary deformation during the deposition of the Maitai Group. After removal of Mesozoic rotation, the resulting orientations of paleo-horizontal markers and diverse orientations of intrusive sheets were analysed. Two hypothesises were tested to assess the origin of inclined intrusive sheets: a) that the diverse orientations were the result of tectonic rotation coeval with the intrusion of dikes. b) that primary orientations of the sheets had been diverse. Results show that the sheets were intruded with diverse orientations, probably related to variation in the principle horizontal stress over time. Further rotation of the assemblage of sheets occurred during the last stages of magmatism and during the subsequent period of sedimentation. The last stage probably relates to large scale normal faulting during the development of the sedimentary basin. iii</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt</field><field name="subject">intrusive sheet</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">Western Otago</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and construction of the beam scintillation counter for CMS</field><field name="creator">Bell, Alan James</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the design qualification and construction of the Beam Scintillator Counter (BSC) for the CMS Collaboration at CERN in 2007 - 2008.

Under consideration of its unprecedented growth and diversification, the Antarctic tourism sector is viewed with increasing scrutiny and concern. This concern is expressed in discussions surrounding the success and effectiveness of the existing regulatory framework for Antarctic tourism and asks what changes might be required to adequately protect the Antarctic continent in the future. Viewpoints and interests among Antarctic tourism operators, policy-makers, researchers and other stakeholders diverge, and Antarctic tourism is discussed as being either or both benefactor and detractor to the environmental and political integrity of Antarctica. This thesis discusses, regulations drawing on regime theory, the effectiveness of Antarctic tourism. It postulates the theory that the combined regulatory efforts of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) and industry self-regulation through the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) define the Antarctic tourism regime. Using interviews and a Delphi study as the primary methods of inquiry, stakeholder viewpoints on regulatory and operational characteristics of Antarctic tourism were collected and integrated into a discussion of the effectiveness of the current regulatory regime and an assessment of potential options for regulating Antarctic tourism in the future. The interviews provide insights particularly into operational matters and the in situ practice of tour operators and their compliance with existing regulations. The Delphi study focuses on how the current regulatory issues are addressed, how rules and regulation are enacted and whether the current regulatory framework needs improvement. The thesis research shows that Antarctic tourism stakeholders are concerned about the increasing scale and diversification of Antarctic tourism and generally subscribe to a conservation imperative when assessing potential options for the future regulation of Antarctic tourism. The Antarctic Treaty System is regarded as being stable and having matured over the years, although the regime has not been tested to any great extent. Tourism development in the Antarctic may well prove to be a first test of the stability and success of the Antarctic Treaty System. Stakeholders desire a continued strong partnership between Antarctic Treaty Parties and IAATO regarding the regulation of Antarctic tourism, but conclude that in view of the rapid development of Antarctic tourism, structural, institutional and legislative changes are necessary if Antarctic tourism regulation is to remain successful. The thesis argues that these necessary changes do not inevitably involve a complete overhaul of the existing regulatory regime for Antarctic tourism and that a new overarching regulatory instrument such as a tourism convention may neither be the most desirable nor feasible approach to regulating tourism to the Antarctic. Instead, this thesis research suggests that regulatory improvements need to build on the strengths of the current regime and on a strategic vision that should guide the future regulation of Antarctic tourism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctic tourism</field><field name="subject">Antarctic Treaty System</field><field name="subject">IAATO</field><field name="subject">regime effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of binary star orbits using precise radial velocity measurements with the HERCULES spectrograph</field><field name="creator">Komonjinda, Siramas</field><field name="description">Orbits of spectroscopic binary systems have been studied for more than a century. Over three thousand orbits of spectroscopic binary systems have been derived. These orbits are based on the radial velocities measured from the spectra recorded by a photographic plate to a high precision spectrum observed from a modern spectrograph. In many cases, the shape of the orbit was assumed to be circular, of hence the eccentricity is zero. This assumption is based on the fact that a small eccentricity (e &lt; 0.1) measured from the observed data might be a result from the error of observations or from the intrinsic variation of a spectroscopic binary system. Sixteen southern spectroscopic binary systems, including twelve single-lined binaries and four double-lined binaries, were selected to study in this research program. These systems were assumed to have circular orbits or have very nearly circular orbits (e &lt; 0.1) from their previous published solutions. The HERCULES spectrograph was used in conjunction with the 1-m McLellan telescope at Mt John University Observatory to collect the spectra of these systems. The observations, taken from October 2004 to August 2007, comprised about 2000 high-resolution spectra of spectroscopic binary systems and standard radial-velocity stars. Radial velocities of spectroscopic binary systems were measured from these spectra and orbital solutions of the systems were derived from these radial velocities. It was found that from HERCULES data, we are able to achieve high-precision orbital solutions of all the systems studied. The best-fit solutions can be improved as much as 70 times from the literature&#8217;s orbital solutions. It has been found that the precision of a system depends on the rotational velocities of the components as well as the level of their chromospheric activity. We are able to confirm the eccentricity in the orbit of only one of the selected spectroscopic binary systems, HD194215. Its eccentricity is 0.123 29 &#177; 0.000 78. The small eccentricities of other systems are not confirmed. There are four systems; HD22905, HD38099, HD85622 and HD197649, that have circular orbital solutions from the large errors in their measured eccentricities. Two systems, HD77258 and HD124425, have too small eccentricities, e = 0.000 85&#177;0.000 19 and 0.002 60 &#177; 0.000 99 to be acceptable. An intrinsic variation is a presumed cause of the spurious eccentricities derived from the data of the other eight systems. Photometric data from Mt John University Observatory service photometry program, as well as the photometric data from the Hipparcos satellite and information of these systems from the literature, using various methods and instruments, give a wider view on the systems&#8217; behaviour. It is possible that the spurious eccentricities derived for these systems result from the eclipsing behaviour of a system (HD50337), or from the nature of the components, such as, the distortion of their shape (HD352 and HD136905), their chromospheric activity (HD9053, HD3405, HD77137, HD101379 and HD155555), or stellar pulsation (HD30021). Models of the active chromosphere system, HD101379, have been simulated. An analysis of synthetic radial velocity data shows that spots on the star&#8217;s photosphere can cause a spurious eccentricity. The values of the spurious eccentricity and the longitude of periastron are dependent on the spot size, the spot temperature, and the position of the spots.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Binary stars; Spectroscopic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Herbicides and their Lethal and Sub-lethal Effects on the Chemical Communication System of Xenopus laevis</field><field name="creator">Yuill Proctor, Kirsty Ann</field><field name="description">Amphibian populations are in mass decline on a global scale. Various explanations have been considered, including harmful effects from exposure to toxicants. Using Xenopus laevis adults and tadpoles, potential sublethal effects of atrazine, a herbicide, were investigated in this thesis. I also investigated the toxicity of an organic herbicide compared this with the toxicity of a synthetic herbicide, using LC50 values. Whether X. laevis adult frogs could communicate chemically was tested experimentally. The results suggest that adult female X. laevis communicate chemically, but there was no evidence that male individuals did so. For testing tadpoles I used a kin-preference assay. An encouraging trend for kin preference was evident, for both an outbred and an inbred line. Tadpoles changed their behaviour after exposure to l0&#956;g/L of atrazine for 24 hr. Kin preferences in the control tests were reversed after exposure. A hypothesis of altruistic kin avoidance was suggested by these results. However, when individuals were isolated and then exposed, these individuals had more pronounced preference for kin compared to controls. X. laevis tadpoles exposed to Organic Interceptor (organic herbicide) had a LC50 that was more than 7000 times lower than the 20% recommended dose, whereas Roundup Renews' (a synthetic herbicide) LC50 was around 8 times lower than the 1% recommended dose. This research adds to evidence that toxicants have a negative impact on amphibian populations, and suggests that more research needs to be conducted to identify other sublethal effects of toxicants and to clarify the implications these effects might have for the amphibian populations in nature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical communication</field><field name="subject">Xenopus laevis</field><field name="subject">atrazine</field><field name="subject">herbicides</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation and Evolution of Microsatellites in Vertebrate Genomes</field><field name="creator">Buschiazzo, Emmanuel</field><field name="description">Microsatellites are strings of short DNA motifs (&#8804;6 bp) repeated in tandem across genomes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In 20 years, they became popular genetic markers, successfully employed in the field of genetic mapping and gene hunting, as well as to address various biological questions at the individual, family, population and species level. However, evolutionary and demographic inferences from microsatellite polymorphism are hampered by controversy and ambiguity in the mutational processes of microsatellite sequences. Drawing on new data from genome projects, I review in Chapter 1 the concept of a microsatellite life cycle, which hypothesizes that microsatellites follow a life cycle from birth, through expansion, contraction, death and potentially resurrection. To document and understand this integrative concept of evolution, which could help improve current models of microsatellite evolution, there is an implicit need to study the evolution of microsatellites above the species level. A prerequisite of such comparative studies is therefore to find microsatellite loci that are conserved between different species. The near or full completion of many vertebrate genomes and their alignment against one another offer the ultimate approach to find genomic elements conserved over a large evolutionary scale. In Chapter 2, I present a new comprehensive method to find conserved microsatellites in whole genomes. Using the multiple-alignment of the human genome against those of 11 mammalian and five non-mammalian vertebrates, I examine the genomewide conservation of microsatellites, and challenge the general assumption that microsatellites are too labile to be maintained in distant species. In Chapter 3, I present similar results using the alignment of the newly sequenced platypus genome against those of three mammals, the chicken and the lizard, and incorporate these data into the framework created by the 17-genome analysis. This enlarged dataset was ground for attempting to reconstruct a vertebrate phylogeny from the presence/absence of microsatellites in the different genomes. Maximum parsimony analyses resulted in a tree much similar to that of the current view of the vertebrate phylogeny, while Bayesian analyses showed some discrepancies. This work opens a way for novel theoretical developments regarding the inference of ancestral states of microsatellites. In Chapter 4, I show how knowledge on conserved microsatellite sites can help for the development of a set of comparative primers useful across the Mammalia; implementing a similar protocol, nine conserved dinucleotide repeats were genotyped in 20 unrelated individuals of 18 species (nine sister species) encompassing the mammalian phylogeny, including marsupials and monotremes, and four microsatellites were sequenced in 4 individuals per species. My results emphasize conserved microsatellites as a new resource for genetic mapping and population studies. Finally, in Chapter 5, I recount the unexpected extent of structural change among mammalian orthologous microsatellites, including change of complexity, motif replacement and overall length variability. Altogether, these findings provide a comprehensive framework that may help in many areas of research, including molecular ecology, genome mapping, population genetics, and genome and microsatellite evolution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">comparative genomics</field><field name="subject">simple sequence repeats (SSRs)</field><field name="subject">genome evolution</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">cross-species primers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Philosophical accounts of mind in clinical psychology: reconciling the subjective mind and the objective brain</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Kris Anthony</field><field name="description">The problem of reconciling the subjectively known mind with the objectively known brain has puzzled philosophers and scientists for centuries. When attempting to solve this problem in recent times, the focus has been on explaining how the mind is born from the brain, how the two are related, and how we can best understand them. This problem is of particular relevance to clinical psychology because it attempts to both understand and explain pathological presentations by appealing to both subjective personal experience and objective knowledge of the physicality of the brain. In this respect, clinical psychology straddles the gap between mind and brain. This thesis investigates the implications of the mind/brain problem for theory and practice in clinical psychology. Chapter one identifies the tension between knowing the world subjectively and knowing the world objectively and discusses the importance of understanding this tension when investigating the mind/brain problem. Chapter two sets out the foundational concepts of cognitive behavioural approaches in clinical psychology, looking in particular at how cognitive behavioural approaches conceptualise mental events like thoughts and beliefs. It is concluded that while cognitive behavioural approaches to clinical psychology regularly incorporate both mentalistic and physical concepts in its theory and practice, it does not address the inherent problems in their combined use, as revealed by the mind brain/problem. In order to improve the use of mentalistic concepts within the theory and practice of cognitive behaviourally based clinical psychology, chapter three explores the major conceptualisations of mind from the discipline of philosophy of mind. To achieve this improvement, chapter four, suggests that refining of mentalistic concepts in clinical psychology, through the application of philosophical concepts of mind, can be made possible through the use of a framework that captures the different explanatory levels at which the mind/brain operates. The levels-of-explanation framework is put forward for this purpose. Of particular relevance to clinical psychology is the ability to retain the importance of autonomous, subjectively experienced, and causally efficacious mental events, while at the same time, being able to give a realistic account of how these mental events are linked to the physical brain. The levels-of-explanation framework is judged to be a suitable approach with which to achieve this. In chapters five and six, the implications of clinical psychology's use of mentalistic concepts are explored in relation to evidence-based practice and case formulation. It is shown that through a greater understanding of both the nature of mind and the relationship between the mind and the brain, improvements can be made to both the theory and practice of cognitive behaviourally base clinical practice. This is achieved through the application of philosophical concepts of mind, via a levels-of-explanation framework, while both researching and undertaking clinical practice in clinical psychology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical psychology</field><field name="subject">philosophy of mind</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Links Between Simple Sequences and Meiotic Recombination Hotspots</field><field name="creator">Bagshaw, Andrew Tobias Matthew</field><field name="description">Previous evidence has shown that the simple sequences microsatellites and poly-purine/poly-pyrimidine tracts (PPTs) could be both a cause, and an effect, of meiotic recombination. The causal link between simple sequences and recombination has not been much explored, however, probably because other evidence has cast doubt on its generality, though this evidence has never been conclusive. Several questions have remained unanswered in the literature, and I have addressed aspects of three of them in my thesis. First, what is the scale and magnitude of the association between simple sequences and recombination? I found that microsatellites and PPTs are strongly associated with meiotic double-strand break (DSB) hotspots in yeast, and that PPTs are generally more common in human recombination hotspots, particularly in close proximity to hotspot central regions, in which recombination events are markedly more frequent. I also showed that these associations can't be explained by coincidental mutual associations between simple sequences, recombination and other factors previously shown to correlate with both. A second question not conclusively answered in the literature is whether simple sequences, or their high levels of polymorphism, are an effect of recombination. I used three methods to address this question. Firstly, I investigated the distributions of two-copy tandem repeats and short PPTs in relation to yeast DSB hotspots in order to look for evidence of an involvement of recombination in simple sequence formation. I found no significant associations. Secondly, I compared the fraction of simple sequences containing polymorphic sites between human recombination hotspots and coldspots. The third method I used was generalized linear model analysis, with which I investigated the correlation between simple sequence variation and recombination rate, and the influence on the correlation of additional factors with potential relevance including GC-content and gene density. Both the direct comparison and correlation methods showed a very weak and inconsistent effect of recombination on simple sequence polymorphism in the human genome.Whether simple sequences are an important cause of recombination events is a third question that has received relatively little previous attention, and I have explored one aspect of it. Simple sequences of the types I studied have previously been shown to form non-B-DNA structures, which can be recombinagenic in model systems. Using a previously described sodium bisulphite modification assay, I tested for the presence of these structures in sequences amplified from the central regions of hotspots and cloned into supercoiled plasmids. I found significantly higher sensitivity to sodium bisulphite in humans in than in chimpanzees in three out of six genomic regions in which there is a hotspot in humans but none in chimpanzees. In the DNA2 hotspot, this correlated with a clear difference in numbers of molecules showing long contiguous strings of converted cytosines, which are present in previously described intramolecular quadruplex and triplex structures. Two out of the five other hotspots tested show evidence for secondary structure comparable to a known intramolecular triplex, though with similar patterns in humans and chimpanzees. In conclusion, my results clearly motivate further investigation of a functional link between simple sequences and meiotic recombination, including the putative role of non-B-DNA structures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">meiotic recombination hotspots</field><field name="subject">microsatellite evolution</field><field name="subject">poly-purine</field><field name="subject">non-B-DNA structure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and synthesis of beta-strand conformationally constrained calpain inhibitors for cataract treatment via metathesis ring closure</field><field name="creator">Klanchantra, Mutita</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the progress made in the design and synthesis of conformationally constrained &#946;-strand peptidomimetic compounds using ring closing metathesis methodology under microwave irridation conditions. The best macrocycle were elaborated into an inhibitor for a specific protease target. Calpain was used as an example of protease targeting cataract disease. Chapter One introduces proteases in general centring on the general context of protease inhibitor design. The significant of the &#946;-strand 'bioactive' conformation is discussed in details in particular the exploitation of conformationally constrained to potential lock the 'bioactive' conformation. Chapter Two illustrates in silico methods used to design a series of &#946;-strand macrocycle 2.1-2.7. The analysis of these is performed using molecular modelling software Schrodinger suite (2005). A brief discussion of ring closing metathesis methodology is also included. Chapter Three describes the synthesis of the precursor required for RCM reactions (tripeptides dienes). Various types of allylated amino acid side chains were synthesised. The tripeptides were obtained using standard peptide coupling methodology utilising reagents such as HATU, EDC and HOAT. Chapter Four describes the application of ring closing metathesis for the synthesis of &#946;-strand macrocycles. The development of a new reaction conditions to optimise the ring closing metathesis reaction is discussed. In particular the effect of the use of a Lewis acid (chlorodicyclohexylborane) additive in RCM reactions is investigated. Chapter Five discusses the mechanism of cataract formation, cataract treatment and the potential development of calpain inhibitors. One of the macrocycles synthesised in chapter 4 is elaborated into a calpain inhibitor. The in-vitro assay result of this is presented and this compound is currently undergoing in vivo evaluation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RCM</field><field name="subject">Cataract</field><field name="subject">Calpain</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adulthood Outcomes in Rats Following Repeated Adolescent Exposure to 1-Benzylpiperazine (BZP) and/or Ethanol.</field><field name="creator">Perry, James Colin</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, it is common for young people to mix 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP) containing 'party pills' and ethanol (drinking alcohol). However, there is no scientific literature which compares the individual and combined long-term effects of these substances. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a comparison of BZP and ethanol's individual and combined effects on adulthood behaviour following repeated adolescent exposure. To investigate this 40 male and 40 female adolescent rats received daily exposure (post natal days 41 - 50) to BZP (10 mg/kg) and/or ethanol (2 g/kg) or saline vehicle (1 ml/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Animals were tested in a Y maze, light/dark emergence box, and an open field during early adulthood (PND 78 - 81) and again during mid-adulthood (PND 117 - 120). Results found females treated with alcohol ambulated less in the open field. Interestingly, no other behavioural differences between the treatment groups were observed. Overall, it appeared that adolescent exposure to BZP and/or alcohol did not have long-term behavioural consequences, at least in rats. This finding was most likely due to the narrow range of testing ages adopted in the study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1-benzylpiperazine</field><field name="subject">ethanol</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of genetic and experiential explanations for killing on subsequent bug-killing behaviour and moral acceptance of killing</field><field name="creator">Ismail, Ibrahim</field><field name="description">This study examined people&#8217;s attitudes towards killing bugs and their bug-killing behaviour in the context of nature vs. nurture explanations of bug killing. Previous research shows that exposure to genetic (i.e., nature) explanations could have undesirable effects on people&#8217;s attitudes and behaviour, compared to the exposure to experiential(i.e., nurture) explanations. Genetic explanations for killing may affect attitudes towards killing and killing behaviour, because they suggest that killing behaviour is predetermined or programmed by nature. Such explanations may also be used by individuals to overcome guilt and dissonance from prior killing or killing in which they are about to participate. This study tested the idea that exposure to genetic explanations for bug killing would lead people to view killing bugs as more morally acceptable, as well as lead them to kill more bugs. A sample of university students was randomly assigned into three conditions, in which they read either genetic or experiential explanations for why people kill bugs or read a neutral passage. The study utilised a procedure in which participants were led to believe that they were killing bugs (although in actuality no bugs were killed), to observe their killing behaviour in a self-paced killing task.  Half of the participants were also asked to kill a bug prior to the self-paced killing task. Results showed that participants who read genetic explanations viewed bug killing as more morally acceptable, compared to participants who read experiential explanations, and this occurred particularly among those who engaged in the prior killing task. However, no similar effects emerged for the number of bugs killed, though there was a positive correlation between the moral acceptance of bug killing and the number of bugs killed. Implications of genetic explanations with respect to aggression and killing are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">experiential</field><field name="subject">nature-nurture</field><field name="subject">explanations</field><field name="subject">theories</field><field name="subject">killing</field><field name="subject">aggression</field><field name="subject">bugs</field><field name="subject">morality</field><field name="subject">attitude</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photoluminescence of InN with Mg and Zn Dopants</field><field name="creator">Song, Young Wook</field><field name="description">The optical properties of Mg-doped InN thin films grown on YSZ substrates have been investigated by photoluminescence (PL). A series of InN:Mg samples with various Mg cell temperatures (TMg) were produced by molecular beam epitaxy. The effect of Mg concentration on PL emission properties have been explored by various excitation power and temperature dependent measurements. The PL spectra as a function of excitation power exhibited a pronounce blueshift, indicating prominent band filling caused by the Burstein-Moss effect. Meanwhile, a typical redshift was observed as temperature increased due to bandgap shrinkage. The samples with TMg below 210 &#730;C have a dominant peak at energy of 0.68 eV. In contrast, the PL peak emissions for films with a high TMg between 210~230 &#730;C were centred near 0.6 eV. No PL emission was observed from the films with TMg above 230 &#730;C. By fitting with an empirical Arrhenius equation, the activation energies yield approximately 20 meV and 15 meV for the lower and higher energy transitions, respectively.  The fundamental optical properties of Zn doped InN were also examined. InN:Zn films were grown under In-rich conditions. The samples showed well defined PL emission spectra implying that the quality of the film has been improved over the Mg-doped series. The PL spectra of InN:Zn exhibited prominent features containing various emission peaks. The combination of excitation power and temperature dependent measurements supports a precise determination for the origins of the observed transitions. The comparison between the optical properties of Mg and Zn doped InN provide the motivation for more precise quantitative interpretation of p-type InN.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">InN (p-doped)</field><field name="subject">photoluminescence</field><field name="subject">semiconductor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental (in)justice and 'expert knowledge': the discursive construction of dioxins, 2,4,5-T and human health in New Zealand, 1940 to 2007</field><field name="creator">Wildblood-Crawford, Bruce Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the discourses of human health and synthetic chemicals that emerged in New Zealand, focusing specifically on the 1970s dioxin controversy. Dioxins were highly toxic contaminants in the herbicide 2,4,5-T, one of the country&#8217;s most widely used agricultural chemicals from 1948 to 1987. The theoretical framework of the thesis is grounded in poststructural notions about power/knowledge and ideas from sociology and science studies that highlight the inevitable uncertainties that surround human exposure to chemicals. Archival material from the Agricultural Chemicals Board and the Department of Health, chemical industry publications and a range of other textual materials were analysed using a discourse methodology that focused on intertextuality. To better understand the discursive construction of dioxins in New Zealand, the role of the chemical industry, government and opposition groups in constructing, resisting and politicising dioxins is described. The thesis reconceptualizes environmental (in)justices as not exclusively local, but as boundless, discursive and socio-historic in character. It also reflects on how resolving contemporary dioxin injustices in New Zealand, themselves the result of historical exposures, are problematically still being approached primarily through a reductionist approach to health and chemicals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental justice</field><field name="subject">dioxin</field><field name="subject">human geography</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antarctic Fish: Thermal Specialists or Adaptable Generalists?</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Esme Evelyn</field><field name="description">Antarctic fish from the suborder Notothenioidei inhabit what is perhaps the most thermally stable ocean environment on Earth. Evolutionary theory suggests that by specialising for this environment, Antarctic fish have traded-off their ability to respond to variations in temperature, and like their environment, have become extremely stenothermal. However, previous research has revealed that the Antarctic notothenioid fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki is not as thermally limited as evolutionary theory might predict, and is capable of acclimation to 4 &#8451; during a one month period. The purpose of the current research was to investigate the physiological mechanisms that underpin this remarkable acclimatory ability. P. borchgrevinki were acclimated for one month to 4 &#8451; and changes in oxygen consumption, prolonged swimming ability, cardiovascular function, enzyme activity and haematology were measured. Significant changes in resting oxygen consumption rate and prolonged swimming ability occurred during the acclimation period, and these changes were mediated by adjustments of enzyme activity and specific aspects of the haematology. By monitoring resting oxygen consumption and prolonged swimming ability over a much longer, six month, acclimation period it was confirmed that the adjustments evident during one month at 4 &#8451; were sustainable in the long-term, and were not short-term compensatory mechanisms. Interestingly, fish infected with x-cell gill disease did not possess the same ability to acclimate as was demonstrated by healthy P. borchgrevinki. P. borchgrevinki are unusual among the notothenioids, possessing an active, pelagic lifestyle which differs from the sedentary, benthic lifestyle of most other species within the suborder. Therefore, it was hypothesised that the acclimatory ability demonstrated by this species may also be unusual among the notothenioids. To test this hypothesis, the acclimation ability of three sedentary, benthic notothenioids (Trematomus bernacchii, T. hansoni and T. pennellii) was investigated. Results confirmed the hypothesis, with all three species demonstrating very poor survival at 4 &#8451; and absolutely no capacity for acclimation. Such results present a disturbing scenario for the future of Antarctic notothenioid fish in Earth?s rapidly warming climate, and highlights the need for continued research combined with immediate action to combat the warming which currently threatens Antarctic marine biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pagothenia borchgrevinki</field><field name="subject">Trematomus</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">antarctic fish</field><field name="subject">haematology</field><field name="subject">oxygen consumption</field><field name="subject">swimming performance</field><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Environmental Enrichment on Stress-Induced Eating Disturbances in Rats</field><field name="creator">Chu, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Eating disorders are serious psychological disorders associated with debilitating lifestyle, multiple health problems and high rates of suicidality and mortality. Despite extensive research, the aetiology of eating disorders still remains unclear. Amongst the identified risk factors for eating disorders, stress has been frequently studied. The purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that tail-pinch administered to rats could provide an animal model of stress-induced eating disturbances in humans, and whether environmental enrichment might ameliorate the effects of stress.  In Experiment 1, we compared eating behaviours of rats that were reared in either enriched or standard environments and later exposed to tail-pinch and allowed to eat when food deprived. The study showed that a single exposure to tail-pinch induced eating disturbances in most of the rats. When rats were not food deprived, but were conditioned to eating when placed in test chamber, tail-pinch suppressed eating in all rats, but significantly more for rats reared under standard than in enriched conditions. Experiment 2 used a between-subjects design in which rats were reared in either a standard or enriched environment, and were either exposed to tail-pinch or not exposed during sessions in which they were not food deprived and allowed to eat.  Tail-pinch suppressed the food intake of rats reared in enriched but not standard environments.  Although this finding appeared to contradict results of Experiment 1, analysis of body weight revealed that exposure to tail pinch suppressed increases in weight gain across sessions more for rats reared in standard than enriched environments.  The suppression of food intake during test sessions for enriched but not standard rats exposed to tail-pinch was attributed to differences in contextual conditioning and discrimination of the test chamber from home cages.  Overall, results of the present study suggest that rats reared in enriched environments were more resilient to the effects of tail-pinch as a stressor.  Implications of these findings for the understanding of human eating disorders are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eating disorder</field><field name="subject">eating disturbance</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">animal model</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="subject">environmental enrichment</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">tail-pinch</field><field name="subject">food deprivation</field><field name="subject">food intake</field><field name="subject">body weight</field><field name="subject">weight gain</field><field name="subject">contexual conditioning</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional Literacy in Female Offenders</field><field name="creator">Callow, Lauren May</field><field name="description">The BarOn EQ-i model of emotional intelligence and Factor 1 of Hare&#8217;s Psychopathy Checklist-Revised: Screening Version were used to assess emotional literacy and callous-unemotional traits in sixty female offenders.

This association was examined further in relation to criminal history variables; seriousness and chronicity. Emotional literacy was predictive of criminal history, but not offender type. Contrary to expectations, callous-unemotional traits only showed a few relations to emotional literacy namely, significant correlations between PCL: SV Factor 1 score and aspects of problem solving. Violent offenders with high callous-unemotional traits showed significantly more emotional literacy deficits than non-violent offenders with high callous-unemotional traits, especially in interpersonal and adaptability emotional literacy areas.

It is a process that has yet to find extensive industrial application yet shows promise if obstacles such as low rate of production overcome perhaps by more complete theoretical modelling.  This work examines the effects of adding an ionic salt to a solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) in water.  The direct effect was an increase the charge density and electric current.  It was found that an increase in charge density decreases the mass deposition rate and forms a thinner initial jet.  When the sign of the charge on the polymer solution was changed from positive to negative the charge density increased and the initial jet diameter and mass deposition rate also decreased.  It was proposed that a smaller radius of curvature is formed by the Taylor cone at higher charge densities resulting in a smaller &#8220;virtual orifice&#8221;.  The extent of the bending instability was explored and it was found that adding ionic salt results in a decrease in the bending instability resulting in thicker fibres.  Changing the sign of the charge on the polymer solution from positive to negative resulted in an increase in the bending instability and resulted in thinner fibres.  The charge transfer mechanisms used in different electrospinning models are explored and some assumptions not explicitly stated are discussed.  From this discussion a generalized equation describing the charge transport mechanisms is proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrospinning</field><field name="subject">Taylor cone</field><field name="subject">bending instability</field><field name="subject">charge transfer</field><field name="subject">ionic salt</field><field name="subject">poly(vinyl alcohol)</field><field name="subject">deposition rate</field><field name="subject">charge density</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unwanted Pursuit and Stalking Following Intimate Relationship Dissolution</field><field name="creator">Wisternoff, Michele</field><field name="description">Research looking at stalking in the context of relationship dissolution looks at a continuum of behaviours that ex-partners engage in, and has found that unwanted pursuit behaviour and stalking are common following relationship break-down. This study sought to replicate these similar high rates, and to further investigate possible reasons as to why people engage in unwanted pursuit behaviour and stalking following the break-down of intimate relationships. 200 participants who met the criteria of having experienced the break-down of a serious, non-marital, intimate, heterosexual relationship within the last three years were recruited from the University of Canterbury. Each participant filled out a questionnaire detailing the type and frequency of behaviour that they engaged in towards their ex-partner, and that their ex-partner engaged in towards them, after their relationship ended. The questionnaire also examined motivations behind these behaviours. In addition, this study looked at the influence of attachment, three domains of self-esteem (global, self-perceived mate value and narcissism) and intense emotions on stalking behaviour. The contribution of investment in the relationship, satisfaction and relationship alternatives were also examined. Findings showed consistencies with previous research with high levels of post-relationship pursuit behaviour reported. In addition, no gender differences were found in reported frequencies of behaviour. Support was also found for a dyadic pattern of stalking behaviour. Predictions regarding the influence of individual difference factors on stalking behaviour were also supported with higher levels of self-stalking associated with higher levels of anxious attachment, lower levels of global self-esteem and self-perceived mate value, higher levels of emotions, and higher levels of investment in the relationship. Novel research on motives for stalking found an association between positive motives and reconciliation behaviours and negative motives and more serious stalking behaviours. Strong support was also found for several mediation models linking anxious attachment and investment, via mediating variables such as emotions and motives, to stalking behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stalking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organometallics in the Stabilization of Dyed Fibres</field><field name="creator">Ayling, Neroli Kim</field><field name="description">It has been observed that in certain cases the exposure of dyed fibres to aging techniques results in the strengthening of fibres. This thesis explores the hypothesis that the strengthening is due to radical cross-coupling reactions that could be initiated through metal ion mediated photodecarboxylation. The approaches taken in this research include kinetic experiments (using flash photolysis), examination of possible cross-coupling experiments (using species of opposite charge), and the design and examination of small molecule model systems. A flash photolysis system was developed and used in attempts to determine the rates of photochemical product formation for cobalt(III) amino acid complexes. Lower limits have been established for the rate of product formation in these systems. The lower limits are: 2 x 10&#8311; s&#8315;&#185; for [Co(bpy)2(gly)]&#178;&#8314;; 2 x 10&#8311; s&#8315;&#185; for [Co(tpa)(gly)]&#178;&#8314;; and 5 x 10&#8310; s&#8315;&#185; for [Co(tpa)(aib)]&#178;&#8314;, where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine; gly is glycinate; tpa is tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine; and aib is aminoisobutyrate. In past studies, the rates of a series of cobalt(III) amino acid complexes were reported as being the same, and much slower. It is thought that in these cases it may not be the rate of the formation of product that was being measured, but rather the response time of the electronics that was being observed. In this thesis the results obtained for the rate for the aib complex were somewhat lower than those of the gly complexes. This may imply, for the aib complex at least, the rate of the formation of the metallocycle is being observed (and not the response times of the electronics or other limitations of the instrumentation), but the data is poor and there is considerable doubt about this. The steady state photolysis of opposite charged species [Co(bpy)2(gly)]&#178;&#8314; and [Co(EDTA)]&#8315; is reported. The reactions were carried out on a small scale in deuterated solvent for NMR spectrometry analysis and also on a large scale for the possible isolation and characterisation of the products. Evidence was found for a different reaction occurring when both complexes were present. The exact nature of the product remains elusive. A model system was designed in which a dinuclear ligand would bind to two metal centres and a fibre mimic would be later added. Eight ligands are discussed that could potentially bind two octahedral metal centres. They all had a xylene spacing group linking the two polydentate sites together. Five of the ligands have two bidentate binding sites. The other three had two tridentate sites. The binding sites in three of the bis(bidentate) ligands were based on ethane-1,2- diamine (en). Two of these ligands produced hypodentate monocobalt and sundentate dicobalt complexes. The other two bidentate ligands were based on 2- aminomethylpyridine (ampy). Both of these ligands degraded in the complexation reaction conditions. The binding sites in the tridentate ligands were all based on tacn. Once again, the principal products isolated were hypodentate systems in which only one metal ion was coordinated by the ligands. There is a distinct pattern observed in the xylene spaced ligands to form hypodentate complexes with cobalt(III) metal centred complexes. There is evidence of the di-nuclear species from a reaction with a charcoal catalyst in the bis(bidentate) system. &#185;H NMR spectrometry, &#185;&#179;C NMR spectrometry, elemental analysis, X-ray crystallography and UV-vis spectroscopy were used to study and characterise the complexes and ligands that were prepared in this project.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fibre</field><field name="subject">wool</field><field name="subject">flax</field><field name="subject">photochemistry</field><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">decarboxylation</field><field name="subject">ligand</field><field name="subject">coordination complex</field><field name="subject">dye</field><field name="subject">natural dye</field><field name="subject">harakeke</field><field name="subject">laser flash photolysis</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">steady state photolysis</field><field name="subject">complex systhesis</field><field name="subject">tacn</field><field name="subject">xylene based ligand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An engineering geological investigation of ground subsidence above the Huntly East Mine area</field><field name="creator">Kelsey, Philip Ian</field><field name="description">Ground subsidence above the Huntly East Mine at the N.Z.E.D. Hostel has affected an area of approximately seven hectares with measured settlements of over 8OOmm. Extensive damage was suffered by most buildings and services of the hostel complex (a $2M development) with remedial measures being estimated at approximately $450,000. To determine the cause(s) and mechanism(s) of the subsidence, site and laboratory investigations were undertaken. Site investigations included core and wash drilling, geophysical borehole logging, dutch cone penetrometer soundings plus piezometer installation and minotoring. Laboratory investigations included one dimensional consolidation and permeability testing, SEM fabric studies, XRD and chemical tests for clay mineralogy, and determinations of Atterberg Limits and grain size distributions. The mine overburden geology at the site consists of a 35 to 60m thick sequence of mudstones and coal seams of the Te Kuiti Group (Eocene to Oligocene), and overlain by a 50 to 70m thick succession of saturated sands, silts and gravels of the Tauranga Group (Pliocene to Holocene). Within the Tauranga Group three aquifers are present. Drilling, combined with laboratory testing has defined a 4 to 10 metre thick, laterally extensive, highly compressible ignimbritic silt aquitard above the lowest aquifer. The engineering geological model considered most likely to explain the subsidence is mine roof collapse causing void migration to near the top of the Te Kuiti Group sequence resulting in drainage and depressurising of aquifers at the base of the Tauranga Group. Aquifer depressurisation is considered likely to cause consolidation within both the aquifer and aquitards associated with it. Back-analyses of the dewatering consolidation model in terms of both magnitude and rates of settlement are consistent with observed values. A finite difference numerical analysis was developed for estimations of settlement rates. Further field verification of the dewatering consolidation model requires monitoring of piezometers in areas of potential ground movement and inspection of workings under subsided ground.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE TREATMENT OF INFANTS AND PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE</field><field name="creator">Moesbergen, Kevin</field><field name="description">Sleep disturbance in infants and young children has been treated using three strategies: psychotherapy, medication, and behavior modification. Three experiments were undertaken to treat sleep disturbance with infants and preschool children. In the first study, the effects of extinction was evaluated with 13 infants aged 6 to 18 months. In the second study, the effects of extinction plus reinforcement procedures were evaluated with 22 preschool children aged 2 to 5 years, and in the final study, the effects of reinforcement only was evaluated with 22 preschool children. A multiple baseline across subjects design was used in each experiment. Six dependent variables were monitored, including bedtime delay, sleep onset latency, night-waking, duration of each waking, parental attention, and the duration of sleep across a 24-hour-day. Parents recorded data during baseline, treatment, maintenance, and 18 month followup. Results showed 91% of infants (10/11) maintained treatment gains in the first study, 18 months after the termination of treatment. In the second study, 95% of preschool children (21/22) on the extinction plus reinforcement contingency maintained treatment gains at 18 month followup. Finally, 90% of preschool children (19/21) on the reinforcement contingency alone maintained treatment gains at 18 month followup.

While the basic marine culture requirements for the King salmon species are well understood, the etiology of seawater adaptation and growth retardation remains understudied. Consequently, this study was established to investigate the physiological state and causative factors of growth retardation in collaboration with a leading New Zealand aquaculture company, New Zealand King Salmon Ltd (NZKS). Hypoosmoregulatory indicators are not currently used by marine farmers in New Zealand due to the belief that King salmon are more adaptable to seawater than their more highly cultured counterparts, Coho and Atlantic, and can be transferred to seawater anytime after a critical weight is achieved. This study sought to investigate changes in hypoosmoregulatory ability and its relation to water temperatures commonly used in the hatchery environment. This was determined by changes in the activity of the predominating seawater-adapting gill enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase, as an indirect measure of its abundance during smoltification. Changes in plasma ion profiles and the ability to regulate ions after abrupt transfer were also measured and compared with enzymatic activity throughout the austral springtime smoltification period in commercial strains of under-yearling King salmon. It was found that King salmon do undergo a distinct austral spring-time temporal increase in hypoosmoregulatory processes. This was characterised by a 2-fold increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity which was concomitant with reduced plasma Na+ in freshwater and following a seawater challenge in fish between fork lengths of 140-160 mm. Despite no consistent reduction in Na&#177;/K+-ATPase activity during desmoltification, it was shown that the percent of ATP dependent activity specific to Na+/K+-ATPase diminished over time. Increased residual ATP dependent activity is hypothesised to be a result of apical H+-VATPase activity as a compensatory mechanism to rapidly normalise plasma Na+ during desmoltification concomitant with elevated basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase. Water temperature has been linked with the advancement and shortening of the smoltification period in several species. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity and hypoosmoregulatory ability in King salmon were negatively affected by increasing water temperatures above 12&#176;C in contrast to a constant 12&#176;C. The level of growth retardation was dependent on the time of transfer to seawater and was found to increase during a period of reducing hypoosmoregulatory ability. The transfer of growth retarded King salmon back to freshwater resulted in a complete reversal of the growth retarded state, comparable to that observed in Coho and Atlantic salmon. Growth retarded fish were able to readapt back to freshwater with higher survival and growth rates compared to the transfer of normal growing sub-adult King salmon, strongly demonstrating that growth retarded fish are more adapted to freshwater. Osmoregulatory physiology, and endocrinology during the transfer of growth retarded and normal growing fish were investigated. Overall, these results have fundamental implications for the aquaculture of King salmon that are able to be applied by industry to improve current husbandry practices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">growth retardation</field><field name="subject">king salmon</field><field name="subject">Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</field><field name="subject">Walbaum</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kaitiakitanga m&#333; te kiekie &#8211; sustainable harvest Of Freycinetia Banksii</field><field name="creator">van Schravendijk, Cheri Johanna</field><field name="description">For generations, the harvest of native flora and fauna by M&#257;ori was guided by tikanga. In the art of weaving, the sustainability of the culture was greatly dependant on the careful practice of harvest to ensure the maintenance of resources for future generations &#8211; also known as kaitiakitanga. One of the most important weaving materials was the kiekie (Freycinetia banksii). Under tikanga, the traditional method of harvest was to use a hand wrench. This method, it was argued, encouraged vigorous replenishment of the harvested stem, thus mediating human impacts on the resource. However, over the last decade it has arisen that a minority of harvesters may be adopting non-traditional techniques which involve the removal of the entire leaf head. Consequently, patches are slow to recover, and in some cases, the affected stems perish. Despite these observations, there is little in the way of quantitative data. As a result, Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa instigated this research to investigate harvesting practices and their impacts on kiekie. Over 1.5 years, I tested whether traditional harvest was the most appropriate method by measuring how different harvesting techniques affected the recovery of harvested stems at two sites &#8211; one at Te Kotuku Whakaoka (Lake Brunner) on the west coast of the South Island, and the second in the Kaimai Ranges, west of Rotorua, in the North Island. Sixty stems at each site were treated with one of three different harvest regimes &#8211; a traditional hand wrench that removed approx. one-third of the stem tip biomass and was conducted over two different seasons ((1) spring and (2) autumn), and (3) a non-traditional harvest technique removing 100 % of the stem tip biomass with loppers. An additional investigation was conducted to evaluate the recovery of kiekie after goat browse. To simulate herbivory, 50 % of the total leaf area of the stem tip was removed from twenty of the sixty treatment stems. Results showed that the herbivory treatments significantly slowed new leaf production on the stems, when compared to controls. Overall, costs of harvest were higher for the non-traditional method than the traditional techniques. Nontraditionally harvested stems had a poorer recovery, with 20 % dying, and only 27 % of the remaining stems regenerating with an average of 1.73 side shoots. In comparison, the two traditionally hand wrenched stems produced an average of 2.35 (Spring Wrench) and 2.55 (Autumn Wrench) side shoots. Findings also showed that traditionally hand wrenched stems are recovering back lost resources. One and a half years after harvest, the Spring Wrench shoots had recovered 70 % of the removed biomass (dry weight). Average leaf lengths of the three longest shoot leaves on all side shoots per wrench stem were at ~ 38 % of mature leaf size. One year after harvest Autumn Wrench shoots had recovered 2.7 % of the removed biomass (dry weight) and shoot leaves were at ~ 19 % of mature leaf size. Consequently, both are capable of photosynthate synthesis and supply. Measurements did indicate however, that recovery may be sped up in the Autumn Wrench stems which produced more new shoot leaves on all side shoots than the Spring Wrench stems one year after harvest (32.1 and 26.9 shoot leaves respectively); although these results apply to a short research period and could be enhanced by a longer-term study. The findings validate the concerns of weavers regarding the negative impacts of non-traditional harvest on the sustainability of kiekie resources. Furthermore, there is support for tikanga regarding kiekie harvest. The regeneration of stocks shows that of all the harvest techniques investigated, the traditional modes of harvest are the most effective means of mediating the impacts of human harvest on kiekie.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tree holes as habitat for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates in mixed broadleaf-podocarp rainforest, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Blakely, Tanya Jillaine</field><field name="description">Little is known about the spatial distribution and abundance of tree holes in New Zealand&#8217;s native forests, or the invertebrate communities that they support. I found that tree holes were common on five endemic tree species, belonging to the families Fagaceae and Podocarpaceae in the mixed broadleaf-podocarp rainforest of Orikaka Ecological Area, Buller District, New Zealand. However, tree holes were not uniformly distributed throughout the forest, with more holes found on the three podocarp species, Prumnopitys ferruginea, P. taxifolia and Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, than on Nothofagus fusca or N. menziesii. Nevertheless, Nothofagus fusca had the largest holes of any of the tree species sampled and larger trees generally had larger holes. Large, hole-bearing Nothofagus fusca trees support a specialist hole-dwelling vertebrate fauna in New Zealand and worldwide, tree holes provide habitat for a range of invertebrate species. Using specially-designed emergence traps, I collected invertebrates emerging from naturally-occurring dry tree holes and compared this assemblage with invertebrates inhabiting leaf litter on the forest floor and those dispersing aerially throughout the study area. At the higher taxonomic resolution (i.e., Order or Class), community composition within the tree holes was highly variable, and there was no strong distinction between invertebrates from tree holes, leaf litter or Malaise traps. Moreover, although some beetle species emerging from tree holes were found exclusively in tree holes, most of these were represented by a single individual. Consequently, only minor differences in species composition were detected between beetle assemblages from tree holes, leaf-litter and those aerially dispersing throughout the forest. In contrast, the aquatic invertebrate assemblage within water-filled tree holes was highly distinctive from that in ground-based freshwater ecosystems, with only six aquatic taxa in common between all freshwater habitats. Using experimental water-filled tree-hole microcosms, I found that species richness and community composition within these microcosms were primarily driven by resource concentration, although habitat quality (i.e., water chemistry parameters) was also an important determinant of the identity and composition of colonising species. Overall, my study has shown that tree holes are common in the study area, and are likely to be more abundant in New Zealand&#8217;s indigenous forests than previously thought. Moreover, these generally small, discrete forest ecosystems support a diverse array of terrestrial invertebrates as well as a distinctive aquatic invertebrate community that is primarily structured by organic matter resource availability. These findings not only represent an important advance in our knowledge of New Zealand&#8217;s freshwater invertebrate biodiversity, but also highlight the need for further investigation into these unique forest canopy habitats which may well be at risk from deforestation and land use change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">ecosystem size</field><field name="subject">phytotelmata</field><field name="subject">saproxylic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">structural equation modelling</field><field name="subject">tree holes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origin and biogeography of New Zealand Craspedia (Compositae: Gnaphalieae)</field><field name="creator">Ford, Kerry</field><field name="description">Craspedia (Compositae: Gnaphalieae) is a genus of 23 species found only in Australia and New Zealand.  New Zealand species of Craspedia have confusing and continuous character variation, with boundaries between species often indistinct and relationships difficult to elucidate.  Taxonomic treatments in the genus so far have been regionally based, with the result that species between New Zealand and Australia have not been adequately compared.  Phylogenetic analyses of ITS, ETS and psbA-trnH non-coding spacers show that New Zealand Craspedia is a monophyletic group nested within Australian Craspedia.  This is consistent with a jump-dispersal event from Australia to New Zealand across the Tasman Sea.  The New Zealand lineage is identified as sister to one of two Australian lineages, which consists of mainly subalpine and alpine species found on the main divide of south eastern Australia and in Tasmania.  An estimate of when New Zealand Craspedia diverged, using ITS substitution rates from other mainland/island disjunctions in Compositae, gave an approximate date of between 650,000 and 325,000 years ago.  This is consistent with the New Zealand fossil pollen record, and with other molecular studies, in suggesting that the Pleistocene, a period of mountain building and climate change, has been an important factor in the evolution of the New Zealand herbaceous flora.  The two Australian lineages have not previously been recognised based on morphology and it is suggested they represent two independent species radiations into the Australian alpine zone.  Although the New Zealand clade is only partly resolved, the phylogenetic analyses of ITS and ETS indicate that some relationships are incongruent with those previously suggested by morphology and current species boundaries.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Craspedia</field><field name="subject">Compositae</field><field name="subject">Gnaphalieae</field><field name="subject">genus</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">species</field><field name="subject">taxonomic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of trace metals on juvenile cockles (Austrovenus stutchburyi)</field><field name="creator">McConway, Alex</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the population structure and spatial distribution of the cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi in estuaries and bays around the Canterbury coastline.  Surveys investigated population attributes (average density and density of small cockles (&lt; 10mm)) of Austrovenus stutchburyi in relation to physical environmental characteristics such as trace metals (copper, cadmium and zinc), sediment particle size, nitrogen and phosphorus levels, pore water and percentage organic matter of the sediment.  Surface cover of flora and number of fauna present was also correlated with the density of cockles and small cockles &lt; 10mm.  MDS and PCA ordination showed that the biota was similar at 14 sites but differed significantly at the Pleasant Point Yacht Club (PPY) site.  There was a positive correlation between fine sand (125 &#956;m) and the average density of cockles and small cockles &lt; 10 mm.  High population densities of Austrovenus stutchburyi were also positively correlated with phosphorus levels, and percentage cover of Sea Grass (Ulva sp).  However, Austrovenus stutchburyi density was negatively correlated with cadmium and zinc concentration, and percentage of mud present.  The density of small cockles &lt; 10 mm was negatively correlated with copper and cadmium concentration in the sediment and positively correlated with Topshell (Diloma subrostrata) numbers, Sea grass (Zostera muelleri) percentage cover, Sea lettuce (Ulva sp), percentage cover, and sediment particles sizes of &lt; 63 &#956;m (mud), 63 &#956;m (very fine sand), and 125 &#956;m (fine sand).  Survival and behavioural changes of juvenile Austrovenus stutchburyi were investigated in relation to increased levels of copper, cadmium, and zinc in aqueous solution and sediment in the laboratory, and artificially increased levels in the field.  In laboratory experiments in contaminated seawater it was found that, over time, copper and zinc had a detrimental effect on the percentage of juvenile cockles with their siphons extended as did copper concentration.  Cockles 10 - 12 mm shell length exposed to different concentrations of copper had the lowest survival rate (25%) whilst cockles that were 5 - 7 mm in length had the greatest survival rate (69%).  Cadmium did not affect survival or siphon extension in aqueous experiments.  In the contaminated sediment experiments in the laboratory, the concentration of zinc (0, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg Zn/kg (dry weight)) and cadmium (0, 1.8, 5.6, 18, 36 mg Cd/kg (dry weight)) both decreased survival and burial of juvenile cockles in higher concentrations.  Copper concentration (0, 5, 10, 25, 50 mg Cu /kg (dry weight)) decreased burial rates of juvenile cockles but did not affect survival.  Transfer of juvenile Austrovenus stutchburyi within three sites in the Avon Heathcote Estuary during May 2007, found that site and exposure to copper, cadmium and zinc decreased the survival of the juvenile cockles.  However, transfer of cockles between estuaries (Takamatua, Saltwater Creek and Avon &#8211; Heathcote Estuary) in May 2007 found that exposure to copper, cadmium and zinc had the main effect on survival of juvenile cockles.  In July 2007 transfers of cockles between estuaries, site and exposure to copper, cadmium and zinc had an effect of survival on juvenile cockles.  Cockle populations in the present research have shown a strong correlation with environmental variables, which can be used for management and conservation.  The research in this thesis is a start to understanding the effects and implications of contaminants on survival, behaviour and recruitment of juvenile cockles. This research will benefit management strategies for increasing population numbers of Austrovenus stutchburyi.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">cockle</field><field name="subject">Austrovenus stutchburyi</field><field name="subject">estuaries</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An all-hazards vulnerability assessment of Arthur's Pass township, South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dundas, Kate Forrest</field><field name="description">Arthur&#8217;s Pass township, located close to the Main Divide of the central Southern Alps, is highly exposed to natural hazards and has been affected by hazard events since it was founded in 1906. The village is a small alpine township, with a permanent resident population of approximately 54. Its location within the Arthur&#8217;s Pass National Park and on the main road between the east and west coasts of the South Island makes it popular with tourists, trampers, climbers and skiers, which can expand the local population to up to 500 people. Its position on the Bealey River floodplain within a highly dynamic tectonic and geomorphic environment makes it vulnerable to earthquakes, landslides, rockfalls, debris flows, heavy rain and snow, river flooding and riverbed erosion. Previous investigations on natural hazards in the area are limited to the Otira Gorge and State Highway 73, with little focus on hazards affecting the village area. Natural hazard events are persistent and frequent in the Arthur&#8217;s Pass region and the village is susceptible to being isolated from external resources during and after a disaster, making it necessary for the village to be self-sufficient during a large-scale disaster. The hazards were identified and analysed using aerial photographs and satellite images, historical data, supported by in-field reconnaissance at various times of the year to record seasonal changes. Hazard mapping used the same methods to illustrate the spatial and volumetric hazard changes over a range of time scales; &gt;2% annual probability of occurrence (0-50 years recurrence interval), 2%-0.2% annual probability of occurrence (50-500 years recurrence interval) and &lt;0.2% annual probability of occurrence (500+ years recurrence interval). The hazard maps show that that most hazards are not restricted to a specific temporal or spatial scale, and that they are often interdependent. It is difficult to determine the precise effects that climate change and global warming will have on natural hazards, but they are expected to increase the unpredictability of hazard events and alter weather patterns significantly in the long-term. A visitor questionnaire undertaken in the village indicated that many visitors do not regard the hazards as severe enough to represent a legitimate threat; hence the public perceptions of natural hazards are affecting the vulnerability of the village. Additionally, many people do not feel confident that they would know what to do if a disaster did occur in the village. This level of awareness can be improved by providing more information to visitors and displaying details on emergency procedures. The village does not currently have an emergency plan that specifies particular preparedness and response procedures; it relies heavily on a plan adapted from Mt. Cook/Aoraki village. Current emergency management in the village could be improved by the production of an emergency plan specifically for the region, the use of education schemes and information sessions, and the installation of warning signs. The provision of this detailed hazard investigation and hazard maps is intended to assist emergency managers to identify, prioritise, mitigate the hazards to reduce the vulnerability of the village to natural hazards in the short- and long-terms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hazard</field><field name="subject">Arthur's Pass</field><field name="subject">vulnerability assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An electromyographic examination of lip asymmetry during speech and non-speech oral movements in adults who stutter</field><field name="creator">Choo, Ai Leen</field><field name="description">Past research investigating stuttering has cited atypical cerebral lateralization in adults who stutter (AWS) during speech production.  The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral activation in AWS as indicated by lip asymmetry. The study included five AWS (mean age = 26 years of age) and five adults who do not stutter (AWNS) (mean age = 25 years of age). The tasks included single-word productions, single-sentence readings and lip pursings. The peak electromyographic (EMG) amplitude was determined for the left upper, right upper, left lower and right lower lip quadrants around the mouth. Overall, EMG amplitudes were higher for the lower lip than the upper lip. Based on examination of peak EMG amplitude, significant differences were found between speaker groups. For both speech and non-speech tasks, the highest EMG amplitude for the AWS and AWNS groups were on the left lower and right lower sides of the mouth, respectively. The AWNS group showed strong correlations in EMG activity across the four lip sites (r&gt;0.97), indicating an overall synchronous lip activity during speech and non-speech tasks. In contrast, the AWS group showed a strong correlation (r=0.97) only for the left upper and left lower lips while the other lip pairings were not strongly correlated (r&lt;0.738) indicating otherwise reduced synchronous lip activity. While the small sample size suggests caution, clear differences in the pattern of lip EMG activity demonstrated in the present study provides evidence of differences between AWS and AWNS in the cerebral activation governing lip movement. The greater left lip activity observed in AWS was indicative of greater right hemisphere cerebral activation while increased right lip activity was indicative of greater left hemisphere participation in AWNS. The results of the present study provided support for the hypotheses of reversed lateralization for speech and non-speech processing and reduced coordination of speech musculature in AWS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electromyography</field><field name="subject">lip</field><field name="subject">stuttering</field><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory circulation in the abalone Haliotis iris</field><field name="creator">Ragg, Norman Lawrence Charles</field><field name="description">An integrated description of the respiratory system of the abalone Haliotis iris is presented. These animals are believed to be inherently primitive and still bear the ancestral gastropod gill arrangement, thus allowing physiological examination of a 'living fossil'. Ventilation, gaseous diffusion, blood transport and the anatomical arrangement of the vascular system are examined under a range of conditions. Resting H. iris consume an average of 0.47 &#181;mol 0&#8322;.g live weight&#8315;&#185; .h&#8315;&#185;, 87% of which is taken up across the gills, the remainder diffuses directly into the foot and epipodium. A 300g abalone ventilates its gills at a rate of 28mL.min&#8315;&#185;, a rate which, due to low resistance to diffusion (diffusion limitation index = 0.47) and a well matched ventilation/perfusion conductance ratio, is adequate to support the quiescent animal. Increased oxygen demand is accommodated by an increase in cardiac stroke volume, elevating output from 9.1 to 24.4 &#181;L.g&#8315;&#185;.min&#8315;&#185;. At rest the right gill is the predominant gas exchanger, receiving 95.7% of the branchial blood flow, when cardiac output is elevated the left gill becomes equally perfused, effectively doubling the diffusing surface. Ventilation does not increase, and an increased reliance on assistance from external water currents is seen. Previously undescribed components of the vascular system, notably an extensive sinus of mixed venous and arterial blood surrounding the gut and a large vessel that offers a bypass to the right kidney, provide a low resistance circuit between the heart and gills, bypassing the major organs and muscles. The low resistance circuit allows haemolymph to pass from the aorta to the base of the gills with minimal loss of pressure and no phase shift in the pulse, allowing blood to cross the gills with maximal inertia and instantaneous pressure gradient. Haliotis iris therefore appears to have exploited its limited physiological resources to the maximum in the routine operation of its gas exchange system. It is concluded that further improvement could not occur without substantial remodeling of the body plan, which may account for the abandonment of the system by higher gastropods.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paua</field><field name="subject">respiration</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity-Based Negative Priming: Individual Differences in Typical and Atypical Development</field><field name="creator">Pritchard, Verena Erica</field><field name="description">One means by which inhibitory control in selective attention may be studied is with the negative priming (NP) procedure. It is widely assumed that children are characterised by reduced capacity for inhibition (Diamond, 2002) and that inhibitory dysfunction is a key characteristic of children and adolescents with ADHD (Barkley, 1997). This should translate into reduced NP effects for these populations. In this dissertation, four studies using the NP procedure find no evidence for reduced inhibitory function in typical children or in adolescents with ADHD. Study 1 examined the magnitude of NP in children compared with adults. An important line of support for the idea that children suffer an inhibitory decrement has been based an empirical report suggesting that conceptual (identity or semantic) NP effects, assumed to reflect the by-product of distractor inhibition, while consistently found in adults are lacking in children (Tipper, Bourque, Anderson, &amp; Brehaut, 1989). In Study 1, the opposite result was found. Study 2 compared NP effects between 7-year-old children and adults while replicating the respective methodologies of the only two studies to explore conceptual NP effects in developmental populations to date (Pritchard &amp; Neumann, 2004, vs. Tipper et al., 1989) to determine the nature of the divergent results between these studies. In Study 2, it was found that distractor inhibition effects are comparable between children and adults when a NP task contains trials in which the distractor stimulus is consistently incongruent with the target stimulus, but that children may be more susceptible than adults to divide attention between target and distractor when a NP task contains a number of trials in which target selection difficulty is reduced. These are critical new findings, highlighting that reduced NP may often relate to methodological artifacts, and when considered in the light of current theories of NP, are also problematic for anti-inhibitory accounts of NP. Having distinguished more definitively the role of inhibition in developmental NP effects, Studies 3 and 4 explored whether the inhibitory process underpinning NP was implicated in young persons with ADHD. To date, evidence for NP in ADHD populations is equivocal. Study 3 found no evidence for a reduced NP effect in ADHD devoid of a corresponding diagnosis. Study 4 found that conduct and oppositional defiant disorders had the potential to confound the evaluation of NP in ADHD. Taken together, results in Studies 1 - 4 parallel very recent results in the literature on NP in older adults and adult psychopathology where presumed reductions of NP in these populations may also be accounted for by methodological artifacts (Buchner &amp; Mayr, in press). It is concluded that NP may reflect a primitive and robust form of inhibitory processing, one that develops early and one that is often the last to deteriorate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">negative priming</field><field name="subject">distractor inhibition</field><field name="subject">selective attention</field><field name="subject">cognitive development</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">Stroop</field><field name="subject">flanker</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure Elucidation and Synthesis of Natural Products</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Annabel Christine</field><field name="description">In this thesis, synthetic chemistry was used as a tool in the exploration of various aspects of natural products discovered by the natural products research group at the University of Canterbury. Work on the constituent amino acids and connectivity of the pteratides, a potently cytotoxic series of cyclodepsipeptides, had been completed before the beginning of this work (carried out by Miss C. Chen). The elucidation of the stereochemistry of the constituent amino acids was undertaken in this present work. The synthesis of all stereochemical entities of a number of unusual amino acids, which were either not available commercially or were expensive, was carried out, providing reference materials for comparison to the natural products. The synthesis of the diastereoisomers of one of these amino acids, 4-methylproline, was carried out by modification of literature procedures, which led to the development of an improved, concise and stereoselective synthesis. The hydrolysis of the natural products, derivatisation of the resultant hydrolysates, synthetic and commercial reference amino acids and HPLC analysis allowed the full stereochemical assignment of the pteratide series. The total synthesis of spiro-mamakone A, a cytotoxic polyketide isolated by Dr S. van der Sar, was undertaken. The synthesis was not successfully completed due to difficulties in the late-stage formation of a crucial enedione motif. However, very advanced intermediates were successfully synthesised. These synthetic analogues of the natural product were analysed for biological activity, allowing valuable insight into the structure-activity relationship, for example, demonstrating the importance of the enedione moiety to biological activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic synthesis</field><field name="subject">natural products</field><field name="subject">structure elucidation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on the influence of selected environmental factors on the egg and larval instars of the midge Chironomus zealandicus Hudson.</field><field name="creator">Robb, James A.</field><field name="description">The object of this survey has been to investigate various aspects of the biology of the midge Chironomus zealandicus with a view to understanding certain phenomena arising from observations on the Christchurch Drainage Board's oxidation ponds.

For comparative purposes the Templeton and Auckland (Mangere) Sewage Treatment Works were included in the study. Between October 1962 and February 1963, complaints of midge infestation from adjacent residents prompted the Christchurch Drainage Board to introduce a midge sampling programme on the recently initiated oxidation ponds at Bromley. Craig and Burns published a report of the initial survey in March 1963 but since then nothing further has been published concerning observations on these ponds. Comparable surveys were instigated in Auckland (Spiller, 1964) and in the Western U, S. A. especially in California (Anderson et al. 1962, 1964).

From 1962 up to 30 million gallons per day of treated sewage have been discharged from a purification installation designed to give primary and secondary treatment, including a period of retention within a series of oxidation ponds. During this same period the estuarine waters have become increasingly enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient, resulting in extensive growths of macrophytic green algae (collectively termed sea lettuce) on the tidal flats. A greatly increased sewage flow from the treatment plant has undoubtedly contributed considerably to this accelerated eutrophication, and in 1968 the Christchurch Drainage Board instigated an investigation into the problem. The scope of this inquiry was widened in 1970 with the establishment of the Estuarine Research Unit attached to the Zoology Department, University of Canterbury, following the Drainage Board's receipt of a contracted report into flood alleviation in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary from the Hydraulics Research Station, Wallingford, England (hereafter referred to as the "Wallingford Report").</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Venous control in a primitive fish Eptatretus cirrhatus</field><field name="creator">Anstiss, Julie</field><field name="description">Only a small amount of the available literature is concerned with venous control in lower vertebrates, such as fish.

As a result of the lack of information pertaining to the physiology of the central venous compartment of the circulation, my objective has been to investigate various aspects of this in the hagfish Eptatretus cirrhatus.  Hagfishes, with the lowest arterial blood pressures and highest blood volumes amongst the chordates, are the earliest surviving group to separate off from the chordate lineage.  They provide a unique opportunity to investigate likely physiological mechanisms in ancestral chordates.  The data presented in this thesis suggest thtat 1) E. cirhatus exhibit some cardiovascular compensation during volume manipulation, however this only occurs with volume loading and not during volume depletion, 2) Veins from E. cirrhatus can respond vasoactively to adrenergic stimulation in vitro and 3) Plasma catecholamines in E. cirrhatus also respond to volume manipulation and provide a potential in vivo mechanism for the control of changes in cardiovascular parameters that were observed during volume loading.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hagfish</field><field name="subject">manipulation</field><field name="subject">catecholamine</field><field name="subject">myography</field><field name="subject">Eptatretus cirrhatus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use and maintenance of assistive listening devices in the Christchurch community.</field><field name="creator">Begg, Simon</field><field name="description">Hearing loss is a disability that affects thousands of people in the world. It is estimated that there is 400,000 people with hearing difficulties in New Zealand (New Zealand Audiological Society, 2007). People with hearing loss have the right to access to information and communication (United Nations Enable, 2003). Without access to information and communication, the hearing impaired may encounter problems with emotional and social functioning, and consequently suffer with decreased quality of life. Clinical experience and investigations have revealed success with assistive listening devices (ALDs) where use of hearing aids has been unsuccessful. ALDs are devices that improve the communication function for the hearing impaired. ALDs can be used with or without hearing aids to overcome the negative effects of poor room acoustics. Currently, in the literature, little is known about the use and maintenance of ALDs in community organizations. This study investigates the use and maintenance of ALDs in the Christchurch community of New Zealand. A list of community organizations that provide ALDs to the public of Christchurch was also made available to individuals who have hearing impairment. The study found there is a lack of ALDs within the Christchurch community. Also that current ALD technology within the Christchurch community is not necessarily compatible with current hearing aid technology and that most organizations rely too heavily on PA systems. PA systems do not necessarily meet the needs of the hearing impaired and an ALD specifically targeting their hearing loss would improve their speech perception. Community organizations are not advertising enough that they offer ALDs which adds to the lack of awareness in Christchurch. Results found that most ALDs in the Christchurch community are in working order, however, there is a need for organizations to be educated about their use and maintenance. Audiologists and other health professionals have a key role in providing appropriate recommendations in the use and benefits that ALDs have on speech perception. These will directly improve the listening situations that the hearing impaired have throughout their communities, thus improving their quality of life.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assistive listening</field><field name="subject">hearing loss</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative analysis of evolutionary changes in island birds</field><field name="creator">Fluen, Tommy</field><field name="description">The evolutionary pressures of islands are often considered to be quite different to those found in continental systems. The insular flora and fauna and their characteristics that have resulted from this unique suite of pressures have puzzled scientists for centuries. This thesis uses the comparative approach to examine how island passerine birds differ from continental birds. Birds on islands like New Zealand have had an evolutionary history free from mammalian predators, in contrast to continental European species that co-evolved with mammals. Given this difference I examined how island birds differed from continental birds in three ways: sound, smell and appearance. I first looked at differences in the begging vocalisations of New Zealand nestling birds and compared these to the vocalisations of nestling introduced European birds. I expected that introduced species should produce less conspicuous calls given their co-evolutionary history with mammalian predators, while New Zealand birds should have comparatively more conspicuous begging calls. In fact, the calls of the two groups of birds were relatively similar. I then looked at the differences in the volatility ("smell") of preen waxes between native New Zealand species and introduced European species. I tested the prediction that New Zealand birds, which did not evolve with predatory mammals that located prey by smell, should produce preen waxes that do not function as 'olfactory crypsis' as found in continental birds. As found previously, introduced species adopt an 'olfactory crypsis' regime in by producing less volatile waxes during incubation. In contrast, most native species showed no shift in wax volatility, with one species even becoming more volatile in the breeding season, supporting a role of predation risk in the evolution of bird odours. Finally, I conducted a survey of evolutionary changes in appearance between insular and continental birds across a variety of isolated island groups, I compared changes in size, mass, wing length, bill size, carotenoid pigmentation, melanin pigmentation and 'dullness'. I found that island species were significantly larger, with larger bills than their continental counterparts. I also found that carotenoids decreased, and melanin pigmentation significantly increased, resulting in 'duller' island species. The reasons for these changes are not clear but highlight how island environments must differ in selective pressures from that encountered by birds on the continents. Overall my findings confirm that island species differ from continental species, and this extends to both their appearance, and somewhat surprisingly, their smell. My work raises a number of additional avenues for research, including a need to investigate the causes of changes exhibited by island birds.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodiversity conservation and evolutionary models</field><field name="creator">Hartmann, Klaas</field><field name="description">Biodiversity conservation requires a framework for prioritising limited resources to the many endangered species. One such framework that has seen much attention and is considered extensively in this thesis, is the Noah's Ark Problem (NAP). The NAP combines a biodiversity measure (Phylogenetic Diversity; PD) with species survival probabilities and conservation costs. The aim of the NAP is to allocate the limited conservation resources  such that the future expected PD is maximised. Obtaining optimal solutions to the NAP is a computationally complex problem to which several efficient algorithms are provided here. An extension to the NAP is also developed which allows uncertainty about the survival probability estimates to be included. Using this extension we show that the NAP is robust to uncertainty in these parameters and that even very poor estimates are beneficial. To justify using or promoting PD, it must produce a significant increase in the amount of biodiversity that is preserved. We show that the increase attainable from the NAP is typically around 20% but may be as high as 150%. An alternative approach to PD and the NAP is to prioritise species using simple species specific indices. The benefit of these indices is that they are easy to calculate, explain and integrate into existing management frameworks. Here we investigate the use of such indices and show that they provide between 60% and 80% of the gains obtainable using PD.  To explore the expected behaviours of conservation methods (such as the NAP) a distribution of phylogenetics trees is required. Evolutionary models describe the diversification process by which a single species gives rise to multiple species. Such models induce a probability distribution on trees and can therefore be used to investigate the expected behaviour of conservation methods. Even simple and widely used models, such as the Yule model, remain poorly understood. In this thesis we present some new analytic results and methods for sampling trees from a broad range of evolutionary models. Lastly we introduce a new model that provides a simple biological explanation for a long standing discrepancy between models and trees derived from real data -- the tree balance distribution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">evolutionary models</field><field name="subject">Noah's Ark Problem</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic diversity</field><field name="subject">resource allocation</field><field name="subject">tree balance</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assimilation of snow covered area into a hydrologic model</field><field name="creator">Hreinsson, Einar &#214;rn</field><field name="description">Accurate knowledge of water content in seasonal snow can be helpful for water resource management. In this study, a distributed temperature index snow model based on temperature and precipitation as forcing data, is used to estimate snow storage in the Jollie catchment approximately 20km east of the main divide of the central Southern Alps, New Zealand. The main objective is to apply a frequently used assimilation method, the ensemble Kalman square root filter, to assimilate remotely sensed snow covered area into the model and evaluate the impacts of this approach on simulations of snow water equivalent. A 250m resolution remotely sensed data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), specifically tuned to the study location was used. Temperature and precipitation were given on a 0.055 latitude/longitude grid. Precipitation was perturbed as input into the model, generating 100 ensemble members, which represented model error. Only observations of snow covered area that had less that 25% cloud cover classification were used in the assimilation precess. The error in the snow covered area observations was assumed to be 0.1 and grow linearly with cloud cover fraction up to 1 for a totally cloud covered pixel. As the model was not calibrated, two withholding experiments were conducted, in which observations withheld from the assimilation process were compared to the results. Two model states were updated in the assimilation, the total snow accumulation state variable and the total snow melt state variable. The results of this study indicate that the model underestimates snow storage at the end of winter and/or does not detect snow fall events during the ablation period. The assimilation method only affected simulated snow covered area and snow storage during the ablation period. That corresponded to higher correlation between modelled snow cover area and the updated state variables. Withholding experiments show good agreement between observations and simulated snow covered area. This study successfully applied the ensemble Kalman square root filter and showed its applicability for New Zealand conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">snow hydrology</field><field name="subject">assimilation</field><field name="subject">snow model</field><field name="subject">ensemble Kalman filter</field><field name="subject">snow cover</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kaitiakitanga : M&#257;ori values, uses and management of the coast.</field><field name="creator">Hemmingsen, Sarah Ann</field><field name="description">The way in which people seek to manage the environment depends on their cultural identity, history, and the way in which they perceive the environment. For indigenous peoples, ecological knowledge is a key component to their approach to resource management and the relationship to all things living within it. The reinstatement of Ngai Tahu coastal guardianship rights and management methods in Te Wai Pounamu engages a diverse field of cultural politics and dialogues relating to place and identity. The issue of reinstating indigenous coastal management and guardianship rights is a contentious issue and involves cultural politics of identity and place. This thesis examines how contemporary indigenous relationships to the coastal environment have been contested and debated. The processes through which Ngai Tahu seek to have their coastal guardianship rights recognized is also explored. To achieve this, the author has presented three case studies: the Kaikoura coastal environment, Akaroa taiapure and the foreshore / seabed debate to illuminate experiences of Maori relationships with the coastal environment. Insights from theories of place identity and environmental management, especially those with a postcolonial focus are used to map out the cultural politics in which indigenous resource management practices and experiences are related. Interviews, participant observation and analysis established that for Ngai Tahu, having their kaitiakitanga responsibilities and views recognised is integral to the reclamation of cultural identity and authority over places and resources lost to them under Pakeha colonisation. This thesis identifies a range of responses to Maori coastal management and identity and like all cultural processes is one that is often contested, negotiated and mediated by cultural groups. This study concludes that the contestation of Maori coastal management and ownership is often the result of confusion and fear as the practices are different and not fully understood by Pakeha, In all, complex politics of indigenous resource management are identified, in which a great number of colonial and postcolonial perceptions still impact upon the ability of Ngai Tahu to partake in traditional coastal management practices.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The late Quaternary environmental history of the Lake Heron basin, Mid Canterbury, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pugh, Jeremy Mark</field><field name="description">The Lake Heron basin is an intermontane basin located approximately 30 kms west of Mount Hutt. Sediments within the basin are derived from a glacier that passed through the Lake Stream Valley from the upper Rakaia Valley. The lack of major drainage in the south part of the basin has increased the preservation potential of glacial phenomena. The area provides opportunities for detailed glacial geomorphology, sedimentology and micropaleontogical work, from which a very high-resolution study on climate change spanning the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through to the present was able to be reconstructed. The geomorphology reveals a complex glacial history spanning multiple glaciations. The Pyramid and Dogs Hill Advance are undated but possibly relate to the Waimaungan and Waimean glaciations. The Emily Formation (EM), previously thought to be MIS 4 (Mabin, 1984), was dated using Be10 to c. 25 ka B.P. The EM was largest advance of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Ice during the LGM was at least 150m thicker than previously thought, as indicated by relatively young ages of high elevation moraines. Numerous moraine ridges and kame terraces show a continuous recession from LGM limits, and, supported by decreasing Be10 ages for other LGM moraines, it seems ice retreat was punctuated by minor glacial readvances and still-stands. These may be associated with decadal-scale climate variations, such as the PDO or early ENSO-like systems. There are relatively little sedimentological exposures in the area other than those on the shores of Lake Heron. The sediment at this location demonstrates the nature of glacial and paraglacial sedimentation during the later stages of ice retreat. They show that ice fronts oscillated across several hundred metres before retreating into Lake Heron proper. Vegetation change at Staces Tarn (1200m asl) indicates climate amelioration in the early Holocene. The late glacial vegetation cover of herb and small shrubs was replaced by a low, montane forest about 7,000 yrs B.P, approximately at the time of the regional thermal maxima. From 7,000 and 1,400 yrs B.P, temperatures slowly declined, and grasses slowly moved back onto the site, although the montane forest was still the dominant vegetation. Fires were frequent in the area extending back at least 6,000 years B.P. The largest fire, about 5,300 yrs B.P, caused major forest disruption. But full recovered occurred within about 500 years. Beech forest appears at the site about 3,300 yrs B.P and becomes the dominant forest cover about 1,400 yrs B.P. Cooler, cloudier winters and disturbance by fire promoted the expansion of beech forest at the expense of the previous low, montane forest. Both the increased frequency of fire events and late Holocene beech spread may be linked to ENSO-related variations in rainfall. The youngest zone is characterised by both a dramatic decline in beech forest and an increase in grasses, possibly representing human activity in the area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glacial</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">sedimentology</field><field name="subject">micropaleontology</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The communication of information in Western Samoa : the case of health.</field><field name="creator">Bishop, Kevin</field><field name="description">Health and development are inextricably linked.

Analysis of communication processes revealed barriers which reduce the effectiveness of health information diffusion.

Increasing population and tourism within the region is driving development pressures and as more and more development occurs, the risk from natural hazards increases. In order to avoid development occurring in unacceptably vulnerable locations, natural hazard assessments are required. This study is a reconnaissance natural hazard assessment of Lakes Lyndon, Coleridge and Tekapo. There is restricted potential for development at Lake Lyndon, because the land surrounding the lake is owned by the Crown and has a number of development restrictions. However, there is the potential for conservation or recreation-linked development to occur. There is more potential for development at Lake Coleridge. Most of the land surrounding the lake is privately owned and has less development restrictions. The majority of land surrounding Lake Tekapo is divided into Crown-owned pastoral leases, which are protected from development, such as subdivision. However, there are substantial areas around the lake, which are privately owned and, therefore, have potential for development. Earthquake, landslide and climate hazards are the main natural hazards threatening Lakes Lyndon, Coleridge and Tekapo. The lakes are situated in a zone of active earth deformation in which large and relatively frequent earthquakes are produced. A large number of active faults lie within 15 km of each lake, which are capable of producing M7 or larger earthquakes. Ground shaking, liquefaction, landslides, tsunami and seiches are among the consequences of earthquakes, all of which have the potential to cause severe damage to lives, lifelines and infrastructure. Landslides are also common in the landscape surrounding the lakes. The majority of slopes surrounding the lakes are at significant risk from earthquake-induced failure under moderate to strong earthquake shaking. This level of shaking is expected to occur in any 50 year period around Lakes Lyndon and Coleridge, and in any 150 year period around Lake Tekapo. Injuries, fatalities and property damage can occur directly from landslide impact or from indirect effects such as flooding from landslide-generated tsunami or from landslide dam outbreaks. Lakes Lyndon, Coleridge and Tekapo are also susceptible to climate hazards, such as high winds, drought, heavy snowfall and heavy rainfall, which can lead to landslides and flooding. Future climate change due to global warming is most likely going to affect patterns of frequency and magnitudes of extreme weather events, leading to an increase in climate hazards. Before development is permitted around the lakes, it is essential that each of these hazards is considered so that unacceptably vulnerable areas can be avoided.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural hazard assessment</field><field name="subject">Lake Lyndon</field><field name="subject">Lake Coleridge</field><field name="subject">Lake Tekapo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of natural selection and adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity in the invasive success of Hieracium lepidulum in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Parkkali, Seija Anna</field><field name="description">Hieracium lepidulum is an invasive weed in New Zealand. It colonises a wide range of habitats including pine plantations, scrubland, native Nothofagus forest, and mid-altitude to alpine tussock grassland, where it is competing with indigenous species. Understanding the breeding systems and population genetic structure of H. lepidulum is important for biocontrol, and aids in the understanding of evolutionary colonisation processes. H. lepidulum is a triploid, diplosporous, obligate apomict. This type of reproduction through clonal seed does not involve meiosis or fertilisation, and theoretically populations should contain very low levels of genetic variation, the only source being somatic mutation. Common garden experiments and microsatellite markers were used to determine the population genetic structure of H. lepidulum populations in the Craigieburn Range, Canterbury. Both experiments revealed that populations, sampled from three replicate altitudes within three geographically-separated locations, contained no genetic variation; individuals all possessed the same microsatellite genotype. These results strongly suggest that the Craigieburn Range H. lepidulum individuals reproduce solely by apomixis and populations belong to the same clonal lineage. Populations were also examined for their response to two abiotic environmental &#8216;stresses&#8217;, drought and shade. H. lepidulum populations&#8217; exhibited high drought tolerance, yet appeared to be shade-intolerant. Low levels of reproduction in light-limiting habitats will prevent the invasion of H. lepidulum into closed-canopy forest habitats. H. lepidulum appears to have overcome the reduction in fitness associated with apomictic reproduction by phenotypic plasticity, fixed heterozygosity and polyploidy &#8211; all associated with increased vigour, fitness, and the ability to occupy broader ecological niches. This study&#8217;s results are hopeful for the development of biocontrol programs involving genotype-specific pathogens but suggest that grazing management may not succeed. The data will be useful for future comparisons of genetic structure during the course of H. lepidulum invasions and will contribute to the management of this invasive weed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hieracium lepidulum</field><field name="subject">phenotypic plasticity</field><field name="subject">microsatellites</field><field name="subject">triploid</field><field name="subject">apomixis</field><field name="subject">invasive weed</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">species</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment Outcome, Risk Assessment, and Recidivism among Sexual Offenders against Children</field><field name="creator">Beggs, Sarah Marie</field><field name="description">The sexual abuse of children is an issue that society must address with urgency and commitment, given the profoundly damaging effects and widespread occurrence of this kind of crime. Providing psychological treatment to identified offenders is an important endeavour of the criminal justice system, with the aim of reducing recidivism and thereby preventing future victims. This dissertation explores a number of areas relevant to the treatment of sexual offenders on a sample of 223 adult males who completed a prison-based programme for child sexual offenders in New Zealand. Specifically, the assessment of treatment outcome and its relationship with recidivism, risk assessment, and the influence of specific offender factors on estimates of treatment outcome and risk were investigated. Study 1 (N = 218) is an independent validation of the validity of the Violence Risk Scale: Sexual Offender Version (VRS:SO; Olver, Wong, Nicholaichuk, &amp; Gordon, 2007), a recently developed risk assessment instrument for sexual offenders that incorporates both static and dynamic risk factors and contains protocols for the assessment of change as a result of treatment. Results indicate support for the inter-rater reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity of the VRS:SO with regard to sexual recidivism, with pre-treatment and post-treatment scores showing superior predictive validity relative to a widely used measure of static risk (Static-99; Hanson &amp; Thornton, 1999) and a measure of "Deviance" based on a 4-factor battery of relevant psychometric tests (Allan, Grace, Rutherford, &amp; Hudson, 2007). In Study 2 (N = 218), three separate methods of assessing proximal treatment outcome (representative of three categories of treatment outcome measures that have previously been applied in the literature) are applied and compared in terms of their predictive validity with regard to sexual recidivism, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of their use. These measures are: change on a battery of relevant psychometric tests administered prior to and following treatment; change across treatment on the VRS:SO; and post-treatment ratings of the attainment of treatment goals as measured by a modified version of Hogue&#8217;s (1994) Standard Goal Attainment Scaling for Sexual Offenders (SGAS). Results indicate that positive treatment outcomes as measured by all of these methods are associated with reduced sexual recidivism. SGAS scores are identified as being relatively simple and efficient to obtain, however the VRS:SO and the psychometric battery are both able to provide useful pre-treatment clinical information regarding potential treatment targets for a particular offender. Study 3 (N = 223) and Study 4 (N = 216) are explorations of the influence of particular offender characteristics on response to treatment and risk of recidivism. Of particular interest was the personality construct of psychopathy (measured using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, PCL-R; Hare, 1991), and both studies are attempted replications and extensions of previously reported interaction effects involving this construct (Heilbrun, 1979; Seto &amp; Barbaree, 1999). The results of Study 3 indicate that there is no interaction effect between PCL-R scores and treatment outcome (as measured by the SGAS) on sexual recidivism, in contrast to an influential study by Seto and Barbaree (1999). Study 4 reports an interaction effect between PCL-R scores and intelligence on recidivism, such that higher than average IQ scores appear to moderate the well-known association between psychopathy and risk. Overall, the findings reported in this dissertation suggest the importance of considering dynamic factors as well as static factors in sex offender risk assessments, and support the premise that dynamic factors are changeable, with change being associated with changes in recidivism. The potential for certain offender characteristics to influence treatment response and risk of recidivism is highlighted, and several areas for further exploration are identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex offenders</field><field name="subject">child molesters</field><field name="subject">treatment outcome</field><field name="subject">treatment change</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="subject">dynamic risk</field><field name="subject">recidivism</field><field name="subject">psychopathy</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">VRS:SO</field><field name="subject">SGAS</field><field name="subject">PCL-R</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Descriptive Analysis of a Trial: the InterRAI Home Care Assessment Process, the CDHB Pilot</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Julenne Bridget Louise</field><field name="description">Abstract: Introduction: The International Resident Assessment Instrument (InterRAI) is a service and needs assessment tool that the Ministry of Health (MoH) was recommended to use by a report &#8220;Assessment Processes for Older People&#8221; in 2003, authored by the New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG). The MoH has implemented a New Zealand wide pilot in order to test the feasibility of InterRAI&#8217;s use in the elderly population in New Zealand. Aim: The aim of the dissertation is to provide a descriptive analysis of data from the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) Pilot Trial of an InterRAI Homecare Assessment form as a means of assessing the care requirements of the elderly. The data had been collected from 264 people on one, two or three different occasions/assessments. Elderly in the CDHB&#8217;s population catchment&#8217;s area were assessed between 2005 and 2006, with participants throughout Christchurch and surrounding localities, e.g. Rangiora and Kaiapoi. At the time of assessment approximately 80% were community dwelling and about 20% were inpatients. The data were collected from 264 people on one, two or three different assessment occasions. Methods: The CDHB pilot study data was present in two databases, which was transferred and reformatted from an Excel Spreadsheet format to a statistical programme format for analysis, SAS-9 (2004). The elderly were assessed initially once (called Time One) but some were assessed multiple times, i.e. all participants 264 were assessed once (Time One), 147 (56.7 %) were assessed twice, 65 (24.6%) three times and ten (3.6%) four times. The results presented here are mainly of the first assessment only, as this is the total sample. Results and Discussion: There are 178 females and 86 males, ranging in age from 64 - 95, all English speaking and mainly, New Zealanders, of which most are married or are widowed. The mean and median ages are around 80 years of age. Overall, the reason for movement of elderly, i.e. change in Residential Type was ADL Decline. There was also some correlation with elderly person&#8217;s home environment. Possibly the only reason for a non-routine visit to hospital for an elderly person was that the person was alone i.e. no other means of help was available to them. The lack of secondary helpers for the elderly was also important in both elderly person&#8217;s movement and non-routine visits to hospital. Conclusions: The results have provided new information for the CDHB. However, more work is required, such as the ethnicity, age&#8211;gender range and service use. The CDHB are planning to implement the InterRAI assessment process, into the CDHB&#8217;s service delivery, for the elderly population, in Canterbury. Recommendations: Some more time dependent data needs to be analysed i.e. trend analysis across assessments. Further research could focus on two categories, disease coding and medicine usage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">InterRAI</field><field name="subject">CDHB</field><field name="subject">Elderly</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Species Interactions in Weed Biocontrol: Carduus nutans as a Case Study</field><field name="creator">Groenteman, Ronny</field><field name="description">Classical biocontrol systems are sometimes treated as an exercise in community assembly. As such, they include multiple species interactions. This thesis explores multi-species aspects in classical weed biocontrol, using thistles as a case study. The abundance, phenology and impact of three biocontrol agents were followed on their target host, Carduus nutans L. and are described, for the first time in New Zealand for two of them (Urophora solstitialis L. and Trichosirocalus horridus sensu (Panzer)). Composition in New Zealand of the recently revised Trichosirocalus weevil species complex was surveyed nation-wide. One species only was found, albeit exhibiting a wider host range than anticipated from the published revision. Interspecific interactions and individual and combined effect of multiple biocontrol agents on C. nutans were tested in cage setups; the effect on the weed population was then estimated by manipulations of an existing matrix population model for this weed in New Zealand. The potentially better seed predator (U. solstitialis) was outcompeted by the worse seed predator (Rhinocyllus conicus (Froehlich)) which has similar niche preference. Urophora solstitialis was also adversely impacted by the crown-root feeder (T. horridus). Trichosirocalus horridus affected C. nutans survival, even at the medium density used, and significantly reduced potential seed production by 33%; in field densities, T. horridus is likely to affect C. nutans even more. Urophora solstitialis was estimated to destroy about 28% of the remaining seed in the absence of the other agents, and about 17% in the presence of T. horridus. The estimated combined effect of T. horridus and U. solstitalis on C. nutans population growth rate was greater than the effect of either agent alone. In the face of growing weed invasions, multiple thistle species were used to test &#8216;multi-targeting&#8217; as a novel approach to target groups of &#8216;sleeper weeds&#8217;. Both in a field experiment and in a field survey, the seed predator R. conicus was found to attack and damage some &#8216;non-target&#8217; thistle species more in the presence of the target species (C. nutans) than in its absence; however, levels of attack on non-target species were always modest. The ultimate goal of biocontrol is to reduce weed populations. A field survey revealed that current population densities of multiple thistle species in Canterbury are not obviously lower than in the mid 1980s, when only R. conicus was present. This may be because successful biocontrol has reduced the management input required to maintain the same thistle density.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Classical weed biocontrol</field><field name="subject">multi-targeting</field><field name="subject">nodding thisle</field><field name="subject">musk thistle</field><field name="subject">Carduus nutans</field><field name="subject">Rhinocyllus conicus</field><field name="subject">Urophora solstitialis</field><field name="subject">Trichosirocalus horridus</field><field name="subject">Carduus tenuiflorus</field><field name="subject">Carduus pycnocephalus</field><field name="subject">Cirsium vulgare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volcanic hazard risk assessment for the RiskScape program, with test application in Rotorua, New Zealand, and Mammoth Lakes, USA.</field><field name="creator">Kaye, Grant David</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new GIS-based scenario volcanic risk assessment model called RiskScape Volcano (RSV) that has been designed for the RiskScape program to advance the field of volcanic risk assessment. RiskScape is a natural hazards risk assessment software tool being developed in New Zealand by GNS Science and NIWA. When integrated into RiskScape, RSV will add proximal volcanic hazard risk assessment capability, and enhanced inventory design; it presently operates outside of RiskScape by combining volcanic hazard models&#8217; output spatial hazard intensity (hazard maps) with inventory databases (asset maps) in GIS software to determine hazard exposure, which is then combined with fragility functions (relationships between hazard intensity and expected damage ratios) to estimate risk. This thesis consists of seven publications, each of which comprises a part of the development and testing of RSV: 1) results of field investigation of impacts to agriculture and infrastructure of the 2006 eruption of Merapi Volcano, Indonesia; 2) agricultural fragility functions for tephra damage in New Zealand based on the observations made at Merapi; 3) examination of wind patterns above the central North Island, New Zealand for better modeling of tephra dispersal with the ASHFALL model; 4) a description of the design, components, background, and an example application of the RSV model; 5) test of RSV via a risk assessment of population, agriculture, and infrastructure in the Rotorua District from a rhyolite eruption at the Okataina Volcanic Centre; 6) test of RSV via a comparison of risk to critical infrastructure in Mammoth Lakes, California from an eruption at Mammoth Mountain volcano versus an eruption from the Inyo craters; and 7) a survey of volcanic hazard awareness in the tourism sector in Mammoth Lakes. Tests of the model have demonstrated that it is capable of providing valid and useful risk assessments that can be used by local government and emergency management to prioritise eruption response planning and risk mitigation efforts. RSV has provided the RiskScape design team with a more complete quantitative volcanic risk assessment model that can be integrated into RiskScape and used in New Zealand and potentially overseas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Riskscape</field><field name="subject">volcanic risk assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">volcanic hazards</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">Rotorua</field><field name="subject">Mammoth Lakes</field><field name="subject">Mammoth Mountain</field><field name="subject">Long Valley Caldera</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Sound Perception for Cochlear Implant Users</field><field name="creator">Arnephy, Janna Maree</field><field name="description">This study compared adult cochlear implant (CI) users to normally hearing (NH) listeners in their ability to identify various environmental sounds. It also assessed the impact of cochlear implantation on speech perception as well as the ability to identify environmental sounds. A comprehensive Environmental Sounds Perception Test (EST) was developed for this study. It was hypothesised that: (i) the NH participants would score higher than the experienced CI users on the EST; (ii) for the pre-to-post CI group, scores on the EST would be higher post-surgery than presurgery, and (iii) for the pre-to-post CI surgery group, scores on speech perception tests would be higher post-surgery than pre-surgery. 10 experienced adult Nucleus CI users and 24 similarly-aged NH subjects were compared on the EST. The study also tested four adults pre-surgery (with HAs), and subsequently post-surgery with the CI on speech perception tests as well as the EST. The closed-set EST consisted of 45 different sounds selected to be representative of everyday stimuli, classified into 9 groups; transport, nature, arriving home, bathroom, kitchen, household appliances, human, office and other. Each sound was represented by two different tokens, ranging in lengths from 2.5 to 12.5 seconds. The results showed that NH participants scored significantly higher than the experienced CI users on the EST (p &lt; 0.001). For the participants tested pre- and post- surgery, the higher scores with the CI than with HAs was approaching significance (p = 0.068) for both the EST and the speech perception measures. No significant correlations were found between scores on the EST and a range of participant factors such as age or speech perception scores for any group. Overall these results suggest that CI users are poorer than NH participants, but better than HA users with severeto- profound hearing losses, in recognizing environmental sounds.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delayed hearing loss following vestibular schwannoma surgery: Behavioural and electrophysiological responses in the early postoperative period</field><field name="creator">Feldman, Melanie Blair</field><field name="description">Some patients suffer hearing loss in the early postoperative period following vestibular schwannoma (VS) excision despite having intact hearing immediately after surgery. As this phenomenon has rarely been documented or described, the putative mechanism remains vague. The objective of the current study was to document the patterns of change in behavioural and electrophysiological responses in patients following VS surgery to better describe the phenomenon of delayed hearing loss. In particular, we aimed to determine whether the impairment that eventually leads to delayed hearing loss is neural or cochlear in origin.  Auditory function was monitored in six adult patients who underwent surgery at Christchurch Public Hospital for excision of unilateral vestibular schwannoma through the retrosigmoid approach. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively by puretone audiometry, speech audiometry, tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). When measurable hearing was demonstrated postoperatively, pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry and ABR were assessed at 24 hour intervals following surgery. Transtympanic electrocochleography (ECochG) was carried out if wave I of the ABR was lost during the postoperative period. Postoperative monitoring revealed that 4 patients suffered permanent anacusis and the remaining 2 patients had permanent hearing preservation. There were no patients who experienced delayed hearing loss in the early postoperative period. A phenomenon similar to delayed hearing loss was observed in case 2 who demonstrated loss of ABR wave I on the 7th postoperative day. Postoperative ECochG recorded in this case showed an enhanced negative SP on the operated side. The findings of this study are discussed in detail with particular reference to the underlying pathophysiology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audiology</field><field name="subject">vestibular schwannoma</field><field name="subject">acoustic neuroma</field><field name="subject">electrophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental, social, and genetic factors predisposing Xenopus laevis tadpoles to infection</field><field name="creator">Barribeau, Seth</field><field name="description">This work examines the ecological, social and genetic factors that predispose amphibians to infection. In the last 30 years many amphibian populations have declined due to infectious disease, although few researchers have studied the factors involved in mediating amphibian infection. My research is designed to explore some of these factors. I first examined the effects of crowding, kin composition (the relatedness of individuals in a group), and habitat complexity on the growth and survival of Xenopus laevis tadpoles exposed to the bacterial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila. In tadpoles, stress, and in particular corticosterone, a hormone associated with stress, is known to inhibit growth. Crowding, kin composition, and habitat complexity have all been linked to tadpole growth. As corticosterone exposure is also linked to reduced immune function, I examined how these ecological factors influence tadpoles' disease resistance. Tadpoles exposed to the bacterium were significantly smaller and more likely to die than control tadpoles. Tadpoles reared only with siblings (pure sibship groups) were larger, less variable in size, and had lower mortality rates than tadpoles reared in mixed sibship groups. The size difference between pure and mixed sibship groups was greatest when they were exposed to the pathogen. Habitat complexity reduced size variation within tanks but did not affect mean tadpole size. Mixed kinship composition and high tadpole density can increase competition, reduce growth, and increase disease susceptibility. These results indicate that growth was inhibited by pathogen exposure but kin association may ameliorate this effect. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is an integral part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. To determine the importance of the MHC in conferring disease resistance in amphibians, I challenged X. laevis tadpoles, bearing different combinations of four MHC haplotypes (f, g, j, and r), with A. hydrophila in two experiments. Exposure to A. hydrophila affected the growth and survival of these tadpoles and that the MHC moderated these effects. Tadpoles with two MHC haplotypes (r and g) were susceptible to this pathogen and tadpoles with the other two haplotypes (f and j) were resistant. Heterozygous tadpoles with both susceptible and resistant haplotypes were always intermediate to either homozygotes in size and survival. These results demonstrate that MHC genotype plays a major role in determining the impact of bacterial pathogens on the growth and survival of X. laevis tadpoles. To test whether the effect of exposure to pathogens differs according to the similarity of the hosts I challenged tadpoles with natural levels of the microorganisms associated with different MHC genotypes by exposing the tadpoles to water preconditioned by adults of different MHC genotypes. If the pathogens are adapted to the MHC genotype of their hosts, tadpoles exposed to water from adults with which they shared MHC haplotypes would be more susceptible than those exposed to water from MHC-dissimilar adults. Alternatively, if the hosts are adapted to their pathogens tadpoles may be more resistant to pathogens from MHC-similar frogs than those from MHC-dissimilar frogs. I found that tadpoles exposed to water from MHC-dissimilar animals developed faster, but without increased growth, and were more likely to die than those exposed to water from MHC-similar animals. Furthermore, there was an optimal difference between the tadpoles&#8217; and the donors&#8217; MHC where tadpoles were sufficiently different to the donor to defend against its locally adapted pathogens, and sufficiently similar to not be exposed to especially virulent foreign pathogens. Finally, I present an inventory of bacteria found in the gut and skin (nonsystemic sites) and heart, muscle, and abdominal cavity (systemic sites) of captive frogs. I found several species of bacteria previously identified as amphibian pathogens and many bacteria in systemic sites that have not been considered pathogenic to amphibians. None of the frogs tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. I discuss the potential importance of these species of bacteria as amphibian pathogens and as protective probiotics, using New Zealand frogs as a case study. In its sum, this work describes some of the factors that can affect amphibians&#8217; ability to resist disease. I show that the genetic constitution of an individual, specifically in terms of the MHC, affects the impact of a disease, and so too does its social and ecological conditions, including the level of crowding, the kinship of its groupmates and the specific microbial challenges of its immediate environment. I also show that many of the factors linked to tadpole growth and development that are well described in other amphibians also affect Xenopus tadpoles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Xenopus laevis</field><field name="subject">Major Histocompatibility Complex</field><field name="subject">pathogens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Intervention Approach to Target Vocabulary Development in Te Reo Maori in Maori Immersion Settings</field><field name="creator">Gallagher, Kerrie Louise</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a storybook retell technique to facilitate vocabulary acquisition in children educated in M&#257;ori immersion class settings. A second aim of the study was to explore the cultural responsiveness and pedagogical appropriateness of the intervention approach and the importance of relationship building (whakawhanaungatanga) to successful interventions. Nine children participated in the study. These children (aged between 5 and 8 years) were recruited from two Kura Kaupapa M&#257;ori settings in differing urban areas in New Zealand. The children entered the study on a rolling basis in groups of three. The first three participants to enter the study were recruited from the one classroom on the basis of their demonstrating specific language impairment (SLI). The second group of three participants attended a different classroom and these participants were recruited into the study as a result of identified delayed reading development (RD). The third group of three participants from a third classroom was selected as the participants exhibited typical spoken and written language development (TD). The intervention technique utilized in this study adopted a structured approach to teaching the meaning of pre selected vocabulary items that were embedded in class story books. Three different books were selected and each book was read by the teacher to the whole class three times during a one week period. The target vocabulary was highlighted each time it occurred in the story through the following techniques: an adult definition was given for the word, an antonym or synonym was given, and the meaning was acted out by the teacher or the picture detailing the meaning of the word in the book was highlighted. A single subject research design using pre-intervention, intervention and post intervention assessment probes for the target vocabulary items was employed to examine the effectiveness of the intervention in teaching the children the targeted vocabulary. Teacher interviews were also carried out to assess the appropriateness of the intervention in relation to the philosophy of the Kura Kaupapa and its pedagogical appropriateness and cultural responsiveness. The results suggested that the children in all three groups (SLI, RD and TD) made moderate gains in the acquisition of the target vocabulary supporting the hypothesis that targeting vocabulary in story book retelling at a whole class level will lead to acquisition of the vocabulary by the participants' exposed to the intervention. However, using a Two Standard Deviation method to evaluate the significance of each participant's change, the gains made for the RD and SLI participants were not significant. The TD participants did demonstrate a significant difference in the number of words correct. The teachers of the participants involved in the study reported positively on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the intervention for inclusion within the Kura Kaupapa and classroom programme. In particular, teachers' reported that as the intervention included each child in the class (as opposed to a withdrawal intervention model) the intervention was more appropriate for the philosophy of the Kura Kaupapa. The teachers' also reported the effectiveness of the intervention for the development of collaboration and relationship building between the teacher and researcher (a speech-language therapist. The data showed that the intervention investigated in this study was culturally responsive and pedagogically appropriate. It could be included as a component of the class programme as it was responsive to the philosophy of the Kura Kaupapa. The participants' did make moderate gains in the acquisition of the vocabulary (although not at a level to be considered significant for children with delayed development). Further research is necessary to explore the effectiveness of what may potentially be a useful intervention to enhance vocabulary development for children in Kura Kaupapa.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Specific language impairment</field><field name="subject">vocabulary development</field><field name="subject">Maori language</field><field name="subject">Maori language immersion education settings</field><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">story book retell</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship Between Jaw Opening and Phonetic Complexity: A Cross-Language Study</field><field name="creator">Lee, Chao-Chin</field><field name="description">The current study employs a simultaneous cross-system monitoring technique to examine the impact of jaw opening on articulatory and vocal behaviours. The purpose of the study is to determine whether an increased jaw opening posture can improve speech and voice quality in a variety of phonetic contexts. Participants were 20 healthy non-smoking adults, including 10 New Zealand English (Mean = 36.5 years, SD = 14) and 10 Mandarin (Mean = 27.5 years, SD = 9.3) native speakers, with five females and five males in each group. Participants were asked to say, with and without an exaggerated jaw opening posture, monosyllabic consonant-vowel (CV) couplets which contained a vowel (/i/, /a/, or /u/) and a consonant selected from the phonemes in their native language. Signals recorded with the acoustic, electroglottographic (EGG), and marker-based video tracking devices were analyzed to yield (i) acoustic measures, including consonant length, fundamental frequency (F0), percent jitter (%jitter), percent shimmer (%shimmer), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequencies of Formants One and Two (F1 and F2), (ii) EGG measures, including open quotient and speed quotient, and (iii) maximum jaw displacement. A series of two-way Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) and repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on the experimental measures to determine whether there was an effect of task (normal vs. exaggerated jaw opening), language (English vs. Mandarin), consonant, or tone (Tones 1 to 4, for the Mandarin group only). Results showed that an exaggerated jaw opening posture resulted in an expansion of vowel space (as shown in the F1-F2 plot for vowels /i/, /a/, and /u/), increased F0, and positive changes in phonatory stability, including decreased %jitter and %shimmer and increased SNR. These findings highlighted the importance of jaw manipulation in speech treatment and supported the hypothesis that an open mouth approach was useful for speech and voice enhancement, suggesting that jaw opening had a universal effect of reducing phonetic complexity. In addition, some changes of the experimental measures were also shown to be a function of language, consonant, and tone.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleation and Equilibration via Surface Diffusion: An Experimental Study</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, David Norman</field><field name="description">Structures grown via self-assembly are a unique field in nanotechnology. The morphology of self-assembled structures is affected by the balance between kinetics and thermodynamics during growth. Hence structures with tailored morphologies and properties can be created with adjustments in growth conditions. In this thesis we study crystal nucleation and equilibration, for both real and model systems. The growth of thin bismuth films is investigated on three atomically flat surfaces; Mica, Molybdenum di Sulphide, and highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG). Films are grown under UHV conditions, and characterised using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.  For coverages of only a few monolayers, bismuth particles are found to aggregate into flat, isolated islands. Islands have characteristic heights and morphologies for each substrate. By altering the deposition flux and coverage, the island density and morphology can be manipulated. On HOPG substrates, planar islands grown at low flux are replaced by 1D structures at high temperature. These anisotopic structures result from an anisotropy in bond strengths at the crystal-vapour interface.  Depositing Bi on HOPG substrates at low flux or high temperature conditions produces nanorods aligned (roughly) perpendicular to step edges on the graphite. The aspect ratios (ARs) of these 1D structures are found to increase as the deposition flux is lowered, or the substrate temperature is increased. The Arrhenius dependence of the AR is determined from experiment. A Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model for high AR step-edge aggregates was developed, determining the likely growth mechanism for the nanorods. A scaling regime devised from the KMC results predicts the dependence of nanorod ARs on flux and temperature, and allows an estimation of the energy binding Bi dimers to the sides of nanorods.  Thin films can also be grown via the self-assembly of atomic clusters. After deposition coalescence of clusters has implications for the film morphology, and properties. We use KMC simulations to investigate the coalescence of pairs of 3D atomic clusters (15000 to 130000 atoms in size) via lattice based surface diffusion. For early coalescence stages, the radius of the neck region connecting the two clusters is found to develop with a different powerlaw to classical theory. For later coalescence stages, when the nucleation of new atomic layers on facets of the cluster is required for further coalescence the temperature, cluster size, and cluster orientation all influence the coalescence. Equilibration times for clusters coalescing at high temperature are found to be limited by the dissociation of atomic layers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nucleation</field><field name="subject">diffusion</field><field name="subject">crystal</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photometric Analysis of R Coronae Borealis stars in the Magellanic Clouds</field><field name="creator">Woollands, Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the initiation of a multi-site photometric programme to examine the extraordinary behaviour displayed by 18 R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). RCB stars exhibit a unique variability whereby they undergo rapid declines of up to several magnitudes. The decline may take several weeks, whereas the recovery to maximum light may take months or even years. The accepted wisdom for the cause of these enigmatic declines is a phenomenon whereby dust formed in the stellar environment reduces the brightness by as much as eight magnitudes (Clayton 1996). This is followed by the recovery phase during which the dust becomes homogeneously distributed in the stellar environment.  The monitoring programme comprised the collection of UBVRI photometric data using five telescopes located at three different southern hemisphere longitudes (Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, Mount John University Observatory (MJUO) in New Zealand and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in South Africa). The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), that operates at Las Campanas Observatory, provided the longest extent of data (December 1994 to February 2008). This was supplemented by data collected with telescopes at MJUO (September 2007 to January 2008) and SALTICAM on SALT (October 2007 to February 2008). Data calibration across the five instruments was a key element of the analysis, and entailed the use of F116 (an F region standard star) and other tertiary standards. Two important RCB characteristics, the enigmatic declines and the pulsational variability, form the bulk of the analysis presented in this thesis. Examination of the data acquired in the V and I filters resulted in the identification of a total of 18 RCB declines occurring in four stars (three stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and one in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)). Construction of colour-magnitude diagrams (V &#8722;I vs V ), during the recovery to maximum light were undertaken in order to study the unique colour behaviour associated with the RCB declines. The combined recovery slope for the four stars was determined to be [(delta V)/(delta(V &#8722;I))] = 3.37 &#177; 0.24, which is similar to the value of [(delta V)/(delta(V &#8722;I))] = 3.1 &#177; 0.1 calculated for galactic RCB stars (Skuljan et al. 2003). In addition, the slopes calculated for the stars in the LMC ([(delta V)/(delta(V &#8722;I))]LMC = 3.34 &#177; 0.21) and SMC ([(delta V)/(delta((V &#8722;I))]SMC = 3.21 &#177; 0.22) alone, also agree to within their uncertainty. These results may imply that the nature of the dust (i.e. the particle size) is similar in both our Galaxy and the MCs.  The pulsation analysis focused on the identification of pulsation periods in nine RCB stars in the MCs. Two different methods, Fourier analysis and dominant period subtraction, were employed for this purpose. Periodic variations are apparent in these stars, and for the majority, a period of around 40 days (common in RCB stars, Lawson et al. 1990, 1994) was detected using the second identification method. In the future, frequent data collection over several years, and more sophisticated pulsation identification techniques, will increase the probability of extracting individual periods from the complex RCB light curves.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">variable stars</field><field name="subject">Magellanic Clouds</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of population bottleneck size on parasitic load and immunocompetence of introduced birds in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Allen, Sophy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">I investigated parasitic infection and immunocompetence in populations of introduced bird species in New Zealand (NZ) that had experienced a range of population bottlenecks (11-808 individuals), and compared these parameters to non-bottlenecked conspecifics in the United Kingdom (UK).  My aims were two-fold; firstly to assess if population bottlenecks are linked to increased parasite loads and/or decreased immunocompetence, and secondly, to assess at what severity of bottleneck these effects become evident.  I found that ectoparasite load (chewing lice, Order: Phthiraptera, Sub-Orders: Amblycera &amp; Ischnocera) was significantly higher in the more severely bottlenecked species in NZ than in the UK, whilst this difference became non-significant at more moderate bottlenecks.  The difference was mainly driven by the Sub-Order Amblycera.  The prevalence of avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) was significantly negatively correlated to bottleneck size within NZ, after controlling for body mass. Total leucocyte and differential lymphocyte counts were elevated in the less bottlenecked species that were infected with malaria, whilst the populations at the more severe end of the bottleneck spectrum did not exhibit such a response. Furthermore, heterophil/lymphocyte (HL) ratio (a parameter used as an indicator of environmental and/or immunological stress), was significantly raised in the more bottlenecked species when compared to their UK counterparts, and this difference was correlated with the size of the bottleneck.  Immunocompetence was further assessed by the experimental challenge of six introduced birds species in NZ with the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Immune response to PHA was significantly correlated to bottleneck size, but in the opposite direction to that predicted; immune response was greater in the more bottlenecked species.  However, this may be an indication of increased investment in immunity, due to increased parasite and pathogen pressure or differential investment in varying components of the immune system.  Finally, the immune response to PHA was compared in nestlings of two species that had experienced very different bottlenecks (70 vs. 653).  After controlling for ectoparasitic infestation, I found no difference between the two species; however, this finding may be confounded by interspecific competition.  Overall, my findings suggest that more severe population bottlenecks may result in increased susceptibility to pathogens, and impact on the immune system. This has a number of implications for the development of conservation protocols, and future avenues of research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population bottleneck</field><field name="subject">introduced birds</field><field name="subject">immunocompetence</field><field name="subject">avian malaria</field><field name="subject">parasites.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluctuating asymmetry and body morphology in relation to population bottlenecks of introduced birds in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Debruyne, Christine Anne</field><field name="description">The introduction of exotic bird species to New Zealand (NZ) from the United Kingdom (UK) over 100 years ago unintentionally created an ideal study system to examine potential changes in developmental stability due to bottleneck effects. In this study I measured fluctuating asymmetry (FA; random deviations from symmetry between bilaterally symmetrical traits) in 13 species of introduced birds in NZ. FA has been used for conservation purposes as an early warning system of increased developmental instability (DI; the inability to cope with random genetic or environmental perturbations during development). I evaluated DI using FA in several anatomical external and internal morphological traits, and compared differences in body morphology between introduced and source populations in relation to the bottleneck size. I also examined FA in nestlings in two closely related introduced species that passed through two different-sized population bottlenecks. Differences in FA in relation to bottleneck severity were only observed in external traits. FA in external traits in some NZ populations differed from their UK counterparts, but it was in the opposite direction than predicted. FA in external traits varied significantly across NZ populations of introduced species - the most severe bottlenecks species exhibited higher levels of FA than species that passed through larger bottlenecks. There were no patterns in FA and bottleneck size for skeletal traits, most likely due to differences in environmental and genetic stressors resulting in species- and characterspecific FA relationships. Nestling FA was the same for both species, despite the large difference in bottleneck size. FA did decrease over the nestling period, although not at the same rate for each trait, most likely due to the differing costs of development, functional importance, and other environmental stressors that might influence FA in each trait differently. Overall changes in body morphology occurred in four species introduced to NZ, and all species exhibited some changes in trait morphology but were not related to bottleneck size. Finally, the proportion of deformities (deviations from normal phenotype) was higher in NZ than in UK suggesting passing through a bottleneck increased the probability of abnormalities. Although the associations between FA, body morphology and bottleneck severity are complex, my results confirm that measures of morphology have the potential of being useful indicators of DI in the management of endangered species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">F-actin and integrin like proteins in Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">Harland, Chad S.</field><field name="description">Tip growth is the primary form of growth in hyphal organisms and some plant cells.

The aim of this research was two fold; firstly to investigate the Therapist Adherence Measures (TAM) and assess whether the same six subscales, which have been found in previous research, were also obtained in the New Zealand data, and whether TAM results predicted recidivism. The second goal was to investigate if other measures of family functioning (FRC and YBS) and therapist alliance (WAI-S) could provide additional information to the TAM with regards to recidivism. Results indicate that the RYOP TAM's produced different subscale results to the six subscales in earlier MST studies and as such a three-factor subscale model was proposed. The other measures (FRC, YBS and WAI-S) investigated added little information beyond the TAM concerning recidivism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) for Characterising the Internal Structure of Active Fault Zones as a Predictive Method of Identifying the Distribution of Ground Deformation</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Brendan Gilbert</field><field name="description">Bulk rock strength is greatly dependent on fracture density, so that reductions in rock strength associated with faulting and fracturing should be reflected by reduced shear coupling and hence S-wave velocity. This study is carried out along the Canterbury rangefront and in Otago. Both lie within the broader plate boundary deformation zone in the South Island of New Zealand. Therefore built structures are often, , located in areas where there are undetected or poorly defined faults with associated rock strength reduction. Where structures are sited near to, or across, such faults or fault-zones, they may sustain both shaking and ground deformation damage during an earthquake. Within this zone, management of seismic hazards needs to be based on accurate identification of the potential fault damage zone including the likely width of off-plane deformation. Lateral S-wave velocity variability provides one method of imaging and locating damage zones and off-plane deformation. This research demonstrates the utility of Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) to aid land-use planning in such fault-prone settings. Fundamentally, MASW uses surface wave dispersive characteristics to model a near surface profile of S-wave velocity variability as a proxy for bulk rock strength. The technique can aid fault-zone planning not only by locating and defining the extent of fault-zones, but also by defining within-zone variability that is readily correlated with measurable rock properties applicable to both foundation design and the distribution of surface deformation. The calibration sites presented here have well defined field relationships and known fault-zone exposure close to potential MASW survey sites. They were selected to represent a range of progressively softer lithologies from intact and fractured Torlesse Group basement hard rock (Dalethorpe) through softer Tertiary cover sediments (Boby&#8217;s Creek) and Quaternary gravels. This facilitated initial calibration of fracture intensity at a high-velocity-contrast site followed by exploration of the limits of shear zone resolution at lower velocity contrasts. Site models were constructed in AutoCAD in order to demonstrate spatial correlations between S-wave velocity and fault zone features. Site geology was incorporated in the models, along with geomorphology, river profiles, scanline locations and crosshole velocity measurement locations. Spatial data were recorded using a total-station survey. The interpreted MASW survey results are presented as two dimensional snapshot cross-sections of the three dimensional calibration-site models. These show strong correlations between MASW survey velocities and site geology, geomorphology, fluvial profiles and geotechnical parameters and observations. Correlations are particularly pronounced where high velocity contrasts exist, whilst weaker correlations are demonstrated in softer lithologies. Geomorphic correlations suggest that off-plane deformation can be imaged and interpreted in the presence of suitable topographic survey data. A promising new approach to in situ and laboratory soft-rock material and mass characterisation is also presented using a Ramset nail gun. Geotechnical investigations typically involve outcrop and laboratory scale determination of rock mass and material properties such as fracture density and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). This multi-scale approach is espoused by this study, with geotechnical and S-wave velocity data presented at multiple scales, from survey scale sonic velocity measurements, through outcrop scale scanline and crosshole sonic velocity measurements to laboratory scale property determination and sonic velocity measurements. S-wave velocities invariably increased with decreasing scale. These scaling relationships and strategies for dealing with them are investigated and presented. Finally, the MASW technique is applied to a concealed fault on the Taieri Ridge in Macraes Flat, Central Otago. Here, high velocity Otago Schist is faulted against low velocity sheared Tertiary and Quaternary sediments. This site highlights the structural sensitivity of the technique by apparently constraining the location of the principal fault, which had been ambiguous after standard processing of the seismic reflection data. Processing of the Taieri Ridge dataset has further led to the proposal of a novel surface wave imaging technique termed Swept Frequency Imaging (SFI). This inchoate technique apparently images the detailed structure of the fault-zone, and is in agreement with the conventionally-determined fault location and an existing partial trench. Overall, the results are promising and are expected to be supported by further trenching in the near future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MASW</field><field name="subject">surface wave</field><field name="subject">shear wave</field><field name="subject">seismic</field><field name="subject">paleoseismic</field><field name="subject">fault</field><field name="subject">fault zone</field><field name="subject">Dalethorpe</field><field name="subject">Springfield</field><field name="subject">Boby's Creek</field><field name="subject">Taieri Ridge</field><field name="subject">fracture</field><field name="subject">rock strength</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microsatellite Evolution in The Yeast Genome - A Genomic Approach</field><field name="creator">Merkel, Angelika</field><field name="description">Microsatellites are short (1-6bp long) highly polymorphic tandem repeats, found in all genomes analyzed so far. Popular genetic markers for many applications including population genetics, pedigree analysis, genetic mapping and linkage analysis, some microsatellites also can cause a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases and may act as agents of adaptive evolution through the regulation of gene expression. As a consequence of these diverse uses and functions, the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of microsatellite sequences have gained much attention in recent years. Mostly, the focus of studies investigating microsatellite evolution has been to develop more refined evolutionary models for estimating parameters such as genetic distance or linkage disequilibrium. However, there is an incentive in using our understanding of the evolutionary processes that affect these sequences to examine the functional implications of microsatellite evolution. What has emerged from nearly two decades of study are highly complex mutational dynamics, with mutation rates varying across species, loci and alleles, and a multitude of potential influences on these rates, most of which are not yet fully understood.  The increasing availability of whole genome sequences has immensely extended the scope for studying microsatellite evolution. For example, where once it was common to examine single loci, it is now possible to examine microsatellites using genome wide approaches. In the first part of my dissertation I discuss approaches and issues associated with detecting microsatellites in genomic data. In Chapter 2 I undertook a meta-analysis of studies investigating the distribution of microsatellites in yeast and showed that studies comparing the distribution of microsatellites in genomic data can be fraught due to the application of different definitions for microsatellites by different investigators. In particular, I found that variation in how investigators choose the repeat unit size of a microsatellite, handle imperfections in the array and especially the choice of minimum array length used, leads to a large divergence in results and can distort the conclusions drawn from such studies, particularly where inter-specific comparisons are being made. In a review of the currently available suite of bioinformatics tools (Chapter 3), I further showed that this bias extends beyond a solely theoretical controversy into a methodological issue because most software tools not only incorporate different definitions for the key parameters used to define microsatellites, but also employ different strategies to search and filter for microsatellites in genomic data. In this chapter I provide an overview of the available tools and a practical guide to help other researchers choose the appropriate tool for their research purpose. In the second part of my thesis, I use the analytical framework developed from the previous chapters to explore the biological significance of microsatellites exploiting the well annotated genome of the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker&#8217;s yeast). Several studies in different organisms have indicated spatial associations between microsatellites and individual genomic features, such as transposable elements, recombinational hotspots, GC-content or local substitution rate. In Chapter 4, I summarized these studies and tested some of the underlying hypotheses on microsatellite distribution in the yeast genome using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and wavelet transformation. I found that microsatellite type and distribution within the genome is strongly governed by local sequence composition and negative selection in coding regions, and that microsatellite frequency is inversely correlated with SNP density reflecting the stabilizing effect point mutations have on microsatellites. Microsatellites may also be markers for recent genome modifications, due to their depletion in regions nearby LTR transposons, and elements of potential structural importance, since I found associations with features such as meiotic double strand breaks, regulatory sites and nucleosomes. Microsatellites are subject to local genomic influences, particularly on small (1-2kb) scales. Although, these local scale influences might not be as dominant as other factors on a genome-wide scale they are certainly of importance with respect to individual loci.  Analysis of locus conservation across 40 related yeast strains (Chapter 5) showed no bias in the type of microsatellites conserved, only a negative influence of coding sequences, which supports again the idea that microsatellites evolve neutrally. Polymorphism was rare, and despite a positive correlation with array length, there was no relationship with either genomic fraction or repeat size. However, the analysis also revealed a non-random distribution of microsatellites in genes of functionally distinct groups. For example, conserved microsatellites (similar to general microsatellites in yeast) are mostly found in genes associated with the regulation of biological and cellular processes. Polymorphic loci show further an association with the organization and biogenesis of cellular components, morphogenesis, development of anatomical structures and pheromone response, which, is absent for monomorphic loci. Whether this distribution is an indication of functionality or simply neutral mutation (e.g. genetic hitch-hiking) is debatable since most conserved microsatellites, particularly variable loci, are located within genes that show low selective constraints. Overall, microsatellites appear as neutrally evolving sequences, but owing to the sheer number of loci within a single genome, individual loci may well acquire some functionality. More work is definitely needed in this area, particularly experimental studies, such as reporter-gene expression assays, to confirm phenotypic effects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microsatellites</field><field name="subject">short tandem repeats</field><field name="subject">software</field><field name="subject">comperative genomics</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and evaluation of CA clan cysteine inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Millar, Tarek Lawson</field><field name="description">This investigation involved the synthesis of potential CA clan cysteine inhibitors of m-calpain and cathepsin B.

The cytoskeleton protein actin is thought to play a pivotal role in hyphal tip growth, performing a multitude of tasks, one of which may be the provision of a resistive force to counter turgor pressure. An Actin depleted zone (ADZ) was the dominant feature of invasive hyphal tips, which was largely absent from non-invasive hyphae. The Spitzenk&#246;rper was slightly larger in invasive hyphae but this size difference alone was thought insufficient to account for the exclusion of filamentous actin (F-actin) from the tip. The actin nucleating protein formin was found at sites where actin nucleation is occurring, while cofilin, a protein that severs F-actin, was found to localise where F-actin disassembly was likely to be occurring. It is suggested that these proteins are likely to play a role in controlling a dynamic cytoskeleton, rearrangements of which are required for the two modes of growth.  Invasive hyphae were found to generate a higher turgor than non-invasive hyphae. These results suggest that the F-actin rearrangements facilitated by cofilin give an ADZ that may play a role in invasive hyphal tip growth; possibly through a reduction of tip resistance; thus enabling the provision of a greater protrusive force by turgor.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">actin, cofilin, formin, invasive, tip growth, ascomycete, neurospora crassa</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reintroduction of Juvenile Black Stilts to the Wild.</field><field name="creator">Adams, Lynn K.</field><field name="description">Black stilts (Himantopus novaezelandiae) are an endangered wader endemic to New Zealand. The black stilt population is critically low and managers are trying to return the species to a sustainable level by captive-rearing young stilts from eggs. A new and experimental reintroduction programme began in 1993. Over two years, 57 young birds were released to the wild within their natural range in the Mackenzie Basin. The area they were initially released into contains a diversity of feeding habitats and mammalian predators are excluded. Newly released stilts remain around the release area for the first two months feeding and roosting within the predator-reduced area. Many bird species in nature have a high mortality during their juvenile stage. Survival rate of released juvenile black stilts was approximately 50% for the first four months and 30% after the first year. Of the birds whose bodies were found, most had died from trauma related injuries. The causes of the injuries are not known, but several hypotheses have been proposed. Signs on the bodies indicate the causes of death include predation, internal parasites, infection, thyroid dysplasia and powerlines strikes. Time budget and foraging samples were collected over the first four months following the 1993 spring release, periodically over the subsequent over winter, and the first four months following the 1994 spring release. This study investigated possible causes of death of stilts by comparing behaviours of birds that eventually live with those that eventually die. From these comparisons no differences were found in the behaviour of the two groups. Results indicate that all stilts are equally prepared at release and causes of death are independent of the bird's behaviour. Alternative release areas are suggested for future black stilt reintroductions as a means of reducing the initial mortality. The rate of, mortality observed in newly released stilts is likely to be associated with captive-rearing. However, causes and rates of mortality in older captive-reared birds are likely to approximate wild birds of similar age.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How mosquito-eating jumping spiders communicate: complex display sequences, selective attention and cross-modality priming</field><field name="creator">Cross, Fiona Ruth</field><field name="description">Evarcha culicivora is a salticid with an unusual preferred diet (vertebrate blood obtained indirectly by preying on female mosquitoes that have themselves had recent blood meals) and an unusual affinity for particular plant species (Lantana camara and Ricinus communis).

E. culicivora&#8217;s courtship and display behaviour was shown to be especially complex and highly variable.  Experiments on vision-based mate-choice showed that mutual mate-choice behaviour is pronounced in E. culicivora and that both sexes prefer large mates over small mates.  Olfactometer experiments showed that E. culicivora is attracted to the odours of bloodfed female mosquitoes, Lantana camara and Ricinus communis and opposite-sex conspecifics. A prior diet of blood-fed female mosquitoes enhances attractiveness to the opposite sex. Opposite-sex conspecifics paired with the odour of blood-fed female mosquitoes are also more attractive. Cross-modality priming effects were investigated in other experiments that showed individuals of E. culicivora responded more to visual cues of opposite-sex conspecifics when in the presence of certain odours (of opposite-sex conspecifics, blood-fed female mosquitoes and L. camara).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evarcha culicivora</field><field name="subject">salticid</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">preying</field><field name="subject">mosquitoes</field><field name="subject">Lantana camara</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining hyperthermia and ionising radiation: the cell killing effect on mouse leukaemia cells</field><field name="creator">Flewellen, Latoya</field><field name="description">Basic in vitro cell experiments were conducted on the P388 mouse leukaemia cell line to determine whether a supra-additive cell killing effect from combining hyperthermia with ionising radiation exists in the case of leukaemia. Methods were established to measure the cell kill, using a Coulter counter, from hyperthermia alone, radiation alone and several combined regimes. The cell kill from hyperthermia, in the range of 38-50 degrees for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours, and radiation, for 1, 3, 5, 9, 11 and 15 Gy was investigated. The approach used had various limitations, such as the underestimation of cell kill. Consistent trends, however, were found for the hyperthermia and radiation data, in accordance with the literature, which killed cells in a predictable manner. Subsequently, after other preliminary combined experiments were completed, the cell kill from both 5 and 11 Gy combined with hyperthermia at 43, 45 and 47 degrees for 2 hours were investigated. 5 Gy in combination with all levels of hyperthermia resulted in a direct additive cell killing effect. This, however, was not observed for 11 Gy in which a diminished effect was found. The overall level of cell kill from 5 Gy combined with hyperthermia was found to be equal, in the case of 43 degrees, or higher, as for 45 and 47 degrees, to that of those combined with 11 Gy.

It has derived fame from being the only technique yet developed that is capable of the detection of Earth-sized planets beyond the Solar System, the first of which was confirmed as discovered only as recently as 2004. It is, however, a concept which dates back a lot further than the modern day. Its roots may be found in the writings of Newton in the early 1700's. It was further developed by Michell, Laplace and Soldner, and reintroduced by Einstein who derived the same findings from first principles. After this period, however, the concepts of lensing due to the effect of gravity became almost forgotten, experiencing another awakening during the 1960's, but generally left undeveloped. It was not until the 1990&#8217;s that the subject began to grow. After macrolensing events were detected in 1979, it gradually became apparent that microlensing events could be detected as well. Today, various techniques of analyzing microlensing events have been introduced which can reveal, not just the existence of planets, but the shape and atmospheric conditions of individual and binary stars, brown dwarfs, and a variety of other elusive measurements. The history of Gravitational Lensing also serves as a reminder that it is often naive to acclaim a single scientist or researcher as initiating a field of science, but rather the progression and development of concepts is evolutionary, with each step resulting from previous works and influenced by colleagues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baseline Hearing Levels Post-Surgery for the Southern Cochlear Implant Program</field><field name="creator">Vraich, Gurjoat Singh</field><field name="description">This study aims to obtain baseline data on the levels of post-surgery acoustic hearing for adult cochlear implant (CI) users in the Southern Cochlear Implant Program (SCIP), and to compare these to their pre-surgery hearing levels. The surgical techniques for implanting the CI are constantly being improved, with current trends aiming to preserve as much residual hearing as possible. Up until 2007, no specific measures were employed by surgeons involved with the (SCIP) to preserve residual hearing during the implantation procedure. It is hypothesised that: i ) Although post-surgery hearing thresholds will be significantly lower than pre-surgery levels, numerous patients will still have some degree of residual hearing remaining in their implanted ear; and ii) That participants with greater levels of residual hearing in the implanted ear will perform better on speech perception tests. The study included 25 postlingually-deafened adults (18 yrs and above) who were implanted through the SCIP, and who had pre-surgery hearing levels of 100dB or better at 250, 500 &amp; 1000 Hz. There were 6 males and 19 females with a mean age of 57.4 years (SD = 13.89). Their average experience with a CI was 28.12 months (SD = 19.14). Hearing thresholds using puretones as well as speech perception of the participants was assessed. The Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) test for words as well the Hearing-In-Noise Test (HINT) for sentences were used to assess speech perception. The mean post-surgery puretone average (PTA) (i.e. average of hearing thresholds of 250, 500, 1000 &amp; 2000 Hz) was found to be 117 dB HL, as compared to 89 dB HL presurgery. Thirteen of the 25 participants (52%) presented with measurable levels of acoustic hearing levels in their implanted ear. The participants showed significant improvement in their pre-surgery to post-surgery speech perception scores in quiet (Sentences: pre- 19%; post- 82%. Words: pre- 7%; post- 55%).However, participants with greater levels of residual hearing in the implanted ear did not perform better on speech perception tests. These speech perception results suggest that the current implant recipients from the SCIP are obtaining significant improvement in speech perception outcomes post-surgery. Results suggest that hearing can be preserved in CI surgery even without specific techniques being employed. Therefore, there is a potential for greater levels of hearing to be preserved if surgeons start to use modified techniques. This may impact on pre- and post-surgery clinical counselling, as well as when determining the future CI candidacy criteria.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of a particle filtration method in the search for new bioactive natural products from fungi</field><field name="creator">Yusof, Mohd Termizi Bin</field><field name="description">Fungi have been an important source for producing a wide range of secondary metabolites of widely differing chemical structures, as well as biological activities.

Saline water is present very close to the surface between the Southern Hills and the Wairau Fault. Highest concentrations are located in well O28/w/0219 with total dissolved solids concentrations approximately 31,000 mg/L. Only a few wells in the study area have intercepted the saline groundwater. A report by Taylor (2003) has identified the groundwater below the Holocene terrace surface is recharged from Southern Hills runoff, however the Wairau Fault has a significant impact on the groundwater flow on the south bank acting as a semi-permeable barrier to groundwater flow from the southern Hills streams identified by several spring which emerge on the fault trace. The scope of this investigation was to identify the extent of the saline groundwater in the Homelands area and to attempt to define the origin of the highly saline groundwater. Furthermore, to define the groundwater flow path below the upper terrace surface to recharge the Wairau Valley Aquifer. The Multi-Electrode Resistivity technique was used to define the extent of the saline groundwater. This shows the saline groundwater is ubiquitous at depth in the study area. The depth to the freshwater/saline water interface varies laterally in the resistivity profiles. A major control on the presence of the groundwater salinity is considered to be the permeability of the gravel. Gravels with a higher permeability are probably washed of any residual salinity that may have been present in the past. Investigations into the origins of the saline groundwater were completed using stable isotope analysis (&#185;&#8312;O, &#178;H, and &#185;&#179;C), hydrochemistry and age dating techniques (&#179;H and &#185;&#8308;C). Due to the complex chemistry a single source could not be identified, however two methods were identified as the most likely. This was evaporative concentration of fresh water in the Wairau Valley, or the upward migration from the Wairau Fault of formation water probably of seawater origin. The stable isotope data fits best with an evaporative concentration of freshwater within the Wairau Valley, however, ratios of chemical constituents are very similar to other formation waters found in other parts of the world. Stream gauging of streams on the south bank show no significant water loss in the reaches north of the Wairau Fault. Therefore, recharge must be crossing the Fault trace as groundwater. Boundary Creek looses all of its surface flow for most of the year upon reaching the valley floor. Bounday Creek has washed out sections of the Wairau Fault and Major terrace riser between Wr 1 and Wr 2 terrace surfaces. It is proposed that groundwater flowing in the gravels reworked by Boundary Creek is the major recharge source for the Wairau Valley Aquifer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saline Groundwater</field><field name="subject">Wairau Valley</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Virtual Reality to Foreign Vocabulary Learning Making Use of the Loci Method.</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Vincent Jamie</field><field name="description">An experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential for virtual reality-based enhancement of the mnemonic method of loci to yield improvements in performance in the learning of Swedish vocabulary.

However, facial expressions do not always correspond with an underlying emotional state. It is advantageous for perceivers to be able to differentiate between those expressions that are associated with a corresponding emotional state (genuine expressions) and those which are not associated with underlying emotions (posed expressions). The present study investigated the sensitivity of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and age and sex-matched control children to the different emotions underlying posed and genuine smiles. The first task required participants to listen to 12 emotion eliciting stories and select, from a grid of 4 facial expressions (a genuine smile, a posed smile, a neutral expression and a sad expression) that which matched how the target in the story would feel. Children with ASD correctly matched facial expressions and stories than did participants without ASD. The second task required children to look at a series of faces, each displaying either a posed smile, a genuine smile or a neutral expression and indicate whether each target was or was not happy. Participants with ASD were less sensitive both to the underlying emotional state of the targets and to the difference between posed and genuine smiles than were the control participants. Results are discussed in terms of the social deficits symptomatic of ASD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ASD</field><field name="subject">smiles</field><field name="subject">faces</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotion detection: can perceivers identify an emotion from limited information?</field><field name="creator">Halliday, Laura Alyson</field><field name="description">Perceivers who can accurately identify an emotion are more likely to engage in successful social interactions. Research has shown that perceivers can accurately identify emotions from facial expressions. However, in real life not all the features of a displayer&#8217;s face are always visible to the perceiver. The aim of this study was to discover if participants could accurately identify facial expressions of emotion from limited information. Two experiments were carried out to investigate this idea using static photographs of genuine and posed happy, sad and fearful facial expressions. Certain features for each expression have previously been identified to be more informative than others, for example, the eyes and mouth when identifying happiness and the forehead and eyes when identifying sadness and fear. Using this information, this study employed a mask to occlude four separate regions of the face: the forehead and eyebrows, the eyes, the nose and cheeks, and the mouth. In Experiment 1, the experimenter revealed the regions for participants, after each reveal the participants were asked to identify the emotion. In Experiment 2, participants revealed the regions in response to being asked to identify a happy, sad or fearful emotion, after each reveal the participants responded whether the target was feeling the emotion they were identifying. This study found that participants can accurately identify an emotion from limited information and their accuracy increased as more of the target&#8217;s face was revealed. Specifically, participants who viewed the eyes and/or mouth regions were found to be more accurate identifying the emotions than participants who viewed other regions. The results are discussed with respect to contemporary theories of facial expressions of emotion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telomere length of kakapo and other New Zealand birds : assessment of methods and applications</field><field name="creator">Horn, Thorsten</field><field name="description">The age structure of populations is an important and often unresolved factor in ecology and wildlife management. Parameters like onset of reproduction and senescence, reproductive success and survival rate are tightly correlated with age. Unfortunately, age information of wild animals is not easy to obtain, especially for birds, where few anatomical markers of age exist. Longitudinal age data from birds banded as chicks are rare, particularly in long lived species. Age estimation in such species would be extremely useful as their long life span typically indicates slow population growth and potentially the need for protection and conservation. Telomere length change has been suggested as a universal marker for ageing vertebrates and potentially other animals. This method, termed molecular ageing, is based on a shortening of telomeres with each cell division. In birds, the telomere length of erythrocytes has been reported to decline with age, as the founder cells (haematopoietic stem cells) divide to renew circulating red blood cells. I measured telomere length in kakapo, the world largest parrot and four other bird species (Buller&#8217;s albatross, kea, New Zealand robin and saddleback) using telomere restriction fragment analysis (TRF) to assess the potential for molecular ageing in these species. After providing an overview of methods to measure telomere length, I describe how one of them (TRF) measures telomere length by quantifying the size distribution of terminal restriction fragments using southern blot of in-gel hybridization (Chapter 2). Although TRF is currently the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; to measure telomere length, it suffers from various technical problems that can compromise precision and accuracy of telomere length estimation. In addition, there are many variations of the protocol, complicating comparisons between publications. I focused on TRF analysis using a non-radioactive probe, because it does not require special precautions associated with handling and disposing of radioactive material and therefore is more suitable for ecology laboratories that typically do not have a strong molecular biology infrastructure. However, most of my findings can be applied to both, radioactive and nonradioactive TRF variants. I tested how sample storage, choice of restriction enzyme, gel Abstract II electrophoresis and choice of hybridization buffer can influence the results. Finally, I show how image analysis (e.g. background correction, gel calibration, formula to calculate telomere length and the analysis window) can not only change the magnitude of estimated telomere length, but also their correlation to each other. Based on these findings, I present and discuss an extensive list of methodological difficulties associated with TRF and present a protocol to obtain reliable and reproducible results. Using this optimized protocol, I then measured telomere length of 68 kakapo (Chapter 3). Almost half of the current kakapo population consists of birds that were captured as adults, hence only their minimum age is known (i.e. time from when they were found +5 years to reach adulthood). Although molecular ageing might not be able to predict chronological age accurately, as calibrated with minimum age of some birds, it should be able to compare relative age between birds. Recently, the oldest kakapo (Richard Henry) was found to show signs of reproductive senescence. The age (or telomere length) difference to Richard Henry could have been used to approximate the remaining reproductive time span for other birds. Unfortunately, there was no change of telomere length with age in cross sectional and longitudinal samples. Analysis of fitness data available for kakapo yielded correlations between telomere length and fledging success, but they were weak and disappeared when the most influential bird was excluded from analysis. The heavy management and small numbers of kakapo make conclusions about fitness and telomere length difficult and highly speculative. However, telomere length of mothers and their chicks were significantly correlated, a phenomena not previously observed in any bird. To test if the lack of telomere loss with age is specific to kakapo, I measured telomere length of one of its closest relatives: the kea (Chapter 4). Like kakapo, telomere length did not show any correlation with age. I then further assessed the usefulness of molecular ageing in birds using only chicks and very old birds to estimate the maximum TL range in an additional long lived (Buller&#8217;s albatross) and two shorter lived species (NZ robin and saddleback). In these Abstract III species, telomere length was on average higher in chicks than in adults. However, age matched individuals showed high variations in telomere length, such that age dependent and independent telomere length could not be distinguished. These data and published results from other bird species, coupled with the limitations of methodology I have identified (Chapter 2), indicate that molecular ageing does not work in most (if not all) birds in its current suggested form. Another way to measure telomere length is telomere Q-PCR, a real-time PCR based method. Measurement of the same kakapo samples with TRF and Q-PCR did not result in comparable results (Chapter 4). Through experimentation I found that differences in amplification efficiency between samples lead to unreliable estimation of telomere length using telomere Q-PCR. These differences were caused by inhibitors present in the samples. The problem of differential amplification efficiency in Q-PCR, while known, is largely ignored by the scientific community. Although some methods have been suggested to correct for differing efficiency, most of these introduce more error than they eliminate. I developed and applied an assay based on internal standard oligonucleotides that was able to corrected EDTA induced quantification errors of up to 70% with high precision and accuracy (Chapter 5). The method, however, failed when tested with other inhibitors commonly found in DNA samples extracted from blood (i.e. SDS, heparin, urea and FeCl3). PCR inhibition was highly selective in the probe-polymerase system I used, inhibiting amplification of genomic DNA, but not amplification of internal oligonucleotide or plasmid standards in the same reaction. Internal standards are a key feature of most diagnostic PCR assays to identify false negatives arising from amplification inhibition. The differential response to inhibition I identified greatly compromises the accuracy of these assays. Consequently, I strongly recommend that researchers using PCR assays with internal standards should verify that the target DNA and internal standard actually respond similarly to common inhibitors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telomere</field><field name="subject">real-time PCR</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">kakapo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Procedure to Verify the Accuracy of Delivery of Prescribed Radiation Doses in Radiotherapy</field><field name="creator">Peszynski, Ruth Iris</field><field name="description">Abstract  In New Zealand there are currently no regular external audits to verify the full treatment chain in radiotherapy. This thesis reports on a project to devise such an audit procedure suitable to assess the accuracy of the delivery of prescribed radiotherapy doses to patients over the full treatment process. The National Radiation Laboratory (NRL), regulatory authority, will use the method developed to conduct biennial audits of all radiotherapy centres.  A commercial chest phantom with a MOSFET dosimetry system was provided for this project. The MOSFETs were commissioned and their characteristics determined, namely reproducibility, energy dependence and angular dependence. The MOSFETs were also tested in a clinical environment with the phantom. Measurements were carried out to test the MOSFET capabilities in both lung and soft tissue in the phantom. Two plans were devised for the audit process, a straightforward one with two parallel opposed beams and a more complex one involving lung tissue and wedges. These plans were designed to test the entire treatment planning and delivery process.  It was found that each MOSFET detector needed to be individually calibrated. Reproducibility was found to have an average standard deviation of 2% on standard sensitivity and 1.2% on high sensitivity. The angular dependence of the detectors showed that when the MOSFET was rotated by 90 degrees to the beam axis a drop in response of 3% was observed with 6 MV. The energy dependence factor was constant within uncertainty for all MOSFETs. Overall, the MOSFET and phantom dosimetry system was determined to be suitable for the audit. The measurements with phantom showed that doses in high dose regions could be determined accurately.  The greatest variation from the Treatment Planning system dose to the measured dose was 6%. The trial runs of the audit in two New Zealand radiotherapy centres showed that the procedure created is able to find discrepancies within the desired 5%, recommended by the ICRU, in the prescribed dose to the phantom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">audit</field><field name="subject">MOSFET detectors</field><field name="subject">treatment planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive ecology and life history trade-offs in a dimorphic polygynous mammal, the New Zealand fur seal</field><field name="creator">Negro, Sandra Silvia</field><field name="description">Polygyny is the most common mating system in mammalian species (95%), yet our understanding of polygynous systems and microevolutionary processes is still limited. Pinniped mating systems range from extreme polygyny (e.g. elephant seals) to sequential female defence by males and hence have often been used as models for mating system studies. Parentage analysis has enabled the examination of mating success, the identification of pedigrees, and the elucidation of social organisation, greatly enhancing our understanding of mating systems (Chapter 1). However, such analyses are not without pitfalls, with erroneous assignments common in open systems (i.e. when parental and offspring samplings are incomplete). We investigated the effects of the user-defined parameters on the accuracy of parental assignment using two commonly used parental allocation programme, CERVUS and PASOS (Chapter 2). We showed that inaccurate user-defined parameters in CERVUS and PASOS can lead to highly biased output e.g. the assignment rate at 95% CL of offspring with a sampled known mother to sampled males decreased from 58% to 32% when the proportion of candidate males sampled in the parameter options decreasing 4-fold. We found that the use of both CERVUS and PASOS for parentage assignment can increase the likelihood of correctly allocating offspring to sampled parents to 97% in our study system. Incorrect parental assignment can bias estimates of various biological parameters, such as lifetime reproductive success and mate choice preference, and hence bias ecological and evolutionary interpretations. Here, we propose solutions to increase the power of parentage assignment and hence decrease the bias in biological parameter estimates.  In addition, we analysed the effects of the intrinsic bias in likelihood assignment approaches towards assigning higher probability of parentage on individuals with rare alleles and those with heightened offspring-parent matches, which increase with the number of homozygous loci (Chapter 3). We showed that, as a consequence of the algorithms employed in the programmes CERVUS and PASOS, heterozygote males with rare genotypes are assigned higher rates of parentage than males with common alleles. Consequently, where two males could both be biological fathers of a given offspring, parentage assignment will more often go to the male with the rarer alleles (most often in heterozygous loci). Thus, the commonly used parentage assignment methods may systematically bias the results of parentage analyses towards supporting the notion that females prefer more genetically unusual, most often heterozygous, males. Such a bias may sway investigators towards incorrectly supporting the concept that females choose genetically more unusual males for heterozygosity fitness benefits that underpin the good genes hypothesis, when in fact no such relationship may exist.  In polygynous mammals, successful males mate with multiple females by competing with and limiting the access of other males to females. When the status of many males (age, size, health, genetic etc.) prevents them from achieving the primary mating tactic, theory predicts selection for a diversification of male mating tactics. Recent studies in pinnipeds have shown that observed male mating success was correlated to male paternity success in some species (elephant-seals), but not in others (grey seals). The existence of alternative mating strategies can explain those discrepancies. Chapter 4 implemented the guidelines provided in Chapter 2 and 3 and focused on the polygynous New Zealand fur seal Arctocephalus forsteri, predicting that 1) competition for females is likely to cause a diversification of male mating tactics; and 2) that alternative tactics can yield reproductive success. Our results indicated three male behavioural profiles; one corresponded to large territorial males and two illustrated a continuum of alternative tactics employed by non-territorial subordinate males. Our study highlights that holding a territory is not a necessary condition for reproductive success in a population of otariids.  The degree of sexual size dimorphism in polygynous species is expected to increase with the degree of intra-sexual competition and in turn with the degree of polygyny. The life history of an individual is the pattern of resource allocations to growth, maintenance, and reproduction throughout its lifetime. Both females and males incur viability costs of mating and reproduction. However, male viability costs due to increase growth and male-male competition can be greater than female viability costs of mate choice and reproduction. Although an abundant literature on sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology, and parasite infections is available, little is known on the intra-sexual differences in physiology and parasite infections associated to the reproductive success of different mating strategies in mammalian species. Chapter 5 examined the reproductive costs between territorial and subordinate males New Zealand fur seal related to their relative reproductive success using a multidisciplinary approach (behaviour, genetics, endocrinology, parasitology). We found that dominant New Zealand fur seal males endure higher reproductive costs due to the direct and indirect effects of high testosterone levels and parasite burdens. Our study highlights that holding a territory confers a higher reproductive success, but induces higher costs of reproduction that may impair survival.  Understanding microevolutionary processes associated to polygynous systems is fundamental in light of the ongoing anthropogenic alteration of the environment through climatic variations and habitat reduction which ultimately affect opportunity for sexual selection and shape the life history trade-offs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parentage</field><field name="subject">paternity</field><field name="subject">reproductive success</field><field name="subject">mating tactics</field><field name="subject">mating systems</field><field name="subject">polygyny</field><field name="subject">life history</field><field name="subject">pinniped</field><field name="subject">fur seal</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity to Emotion Specified in Facial Expressions and the Impact of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="creator">McLellan, Tracey Lee</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a program of research that investigated the sensitivity of healthy young adults, healthy older adults and individuals with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) to happiness, sadness and fear emotion specified in facial expressions. In particular, the research investigated the sensitivity of these individuals to the distinctions between spontaneous expressions of emotional experience (genuine expressions) and deliberate, simulated expressions of emotional experience (posed expressions). The specific focus was to examine whether aging and/or AD effects sensitivity to the target emotions. Emotion-categorization and priming tasks were completed by all participants. The tasks employed an original set of cologically valid facial displays generated specifically for the present research. The categorization task (Experiments 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a) required participants to judge whether targets were, or were not showing and feeling each target emotion. The results showed that all 3 groups identified a genuine expression as both showing and feeling the target emotion whilst a posed expression was identified more frequently as showing than feeling the emotion. Signal detection analysis demonstrated that all 3 groups were sensitive to the expression of emotion, reliably differentiating expressions of experienced emotion (genuine expression) from expressions unrelated to emotional experience (posed and neutral expressions). In addition, both healthy young and older adults could reliably differentiate between posed and genuine expressions of happiness and sadness, whereas, individuals with AD could not. Sensitivity to emotion specified in facial expressions was found to be emotion specific and to be independent of both the level of general cognitive functioning and of specific cognitive functions. The priming task (Experiments 1b, 2b, 3b,4b) employed the facial expressions as primes in a word valence task in order to investigate spontaneous attention to facial expression. Healthy young adults only showed an emotion-congruency priming effect for genuine expressions. Healthy older adults and individuals with AD showed no priming effects. Results are discussed in terms of the understanding of the recognition of emotional states in others and the impact of aging and AD on the recognition of emotional states. Consideration is given to how these findings might influence the care and management of individuals with AD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">facial expressions</field><field name="subject">genuine</field><field name="subject">posed</field><field name="subject">dementia</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of fluctuating lake levels and habitat enhancement on black stilts (Himantopus novaezelandiae Gould, 1841)</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Mark David</field><field name="description">Two questions relating to the conservation of black stilts (Himantopus novaezelandiae) were addressed: First, what effects do changes in lake levels have on black stilts? Second, how can habitat be manipulated to enhance food supplies for black stilts? Relationships between lake levels and black stilt food supplies, foraging behaviour, habitat suitability and abundance, on 4 - 6 lake deltas, were investigated. On two deltas, declining water levels exposed abundant food supplies and large expanses of suitable habitat, and attracted more stilts to the deltas than were usually present. On the other deltas, availability of food either decreased or did not change, and amount of suitable habitat increased as lake levels declined. Numbers of stilts using these deltas were not related to lake levels. A specific management question was: what effects would extending the operating range of Lake Pukaki, to include water between 513 and 518 metres above sea level (m a.s.l.), have on black stilts? My results suggest that food supplies and physical habitat are similar above and below 518 m a.s.l., and that extending the operating range would have little or no effect on black stilts. The influence of site, substratum addition (straw, stones or topsoil), time, and construction method (excavation or inundation) on black stilt food supplies were investigated in three field experiments. Invertebrate biomass and community composition in recently created wetlands (3 months old) appeared to depend primarily on site-specific conditions such as particle size composition and availability of particulate organic material, but could be influenced by substratum additions and construction methods. Captive black stilt chicks were able to capture and consume common prey taxa that were present on experimental substrata. Wild black stilts foraged and nested at some of the experimental wetlands. These results suggest that wetland enhancement has excellent potential as a management technique for black stilts.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogeology of the Mackenzie Basin</field><field name="creator">Cooksey, Kirsty</field><field name="description">The intermontane Mackenzie Basin is located within the central South Island of New Zealand. The glacial basin contains three glacial lakes which are used for hydroelectric power generation via a canal system that links the lakes. The basin is an area of climate extremes, low rainfall, high summer temperatures, and snowy winters. The area is predominantly used for pastoral farming, however farming practices are changing and, combined with an increasing population, there is a need to define the groundwater resources to enable sustainable resource management.  Little is currently known about the hydrogeological system within the Mackenzie Basin, and what is known is from investigations carried out during the construction of the canal system from 1935 to 1985. There are four glacial formations that overlie Tertiary sequences and Torlesse bedrock. However, due to the glacial processes that have been ongoing over at least the last 300 ka, determining the occurrence and extent of groundwater within the outwash gravels is difficult. It is suggested that the permeability of the formations decreases with depth, therefore horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity decrease with depth. A shallow groundwater table is present within the Post Glacial Alluvial Gravels which is recharged directly from fast flowing streams and rivers as well as rainfall. It appears that this shallow system moves rapidly through the system and it is unlikely that the water infiltrates downwards to recharge the deeper groundwater system. It is thought that a deep groundwater system flows preferentially through the Mt John Outwash Gravels, being the second youngest glacial formation.  Water chemistry and age dating tracer analysis indicate that the deeper groundwater is over 80 years old and that the groundwater system is recharging slowly. The shallow groundwater in the Post Glacial Alluvial Gravels and within the major fans to the east of the basin is 10 to 20 years in age. Baseline data such as water chemistry, groundwater levels, and surface water gaugings have been collected which can be used for future investigations. More data needs to be collected to create a long term record to further define the hydrogeological system and to determine the best way to manage the resource for long term sustainable use in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">Upper Waitaki</field><field name="subject">Mackenzie Basin</field><field name="subject">Groundwater</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, synthesis and testing of &#946;-strand mimics as protease inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Aitken, Steven Geoffrey</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 gives background information on proteases and discusses the concept of protease inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for humans. It introduces the key concept that conformation defines biological activity. It also outlines how proteases almost universally bind their substrate/inhibitors in an extended &#946;-strand conformation. The use of calpain as a prototype protease for the testing of &#946;-strand mimics synthesised later in the thesis is also discussed. Chapter 2 describes how molecular modeling was used to rationalise the structure based activity relationships (SAR) of known calpain inhibitors. Molecular modeling was then used to successfully design a number of acyclic &#946;-strand mimics. The synthesis and testing of eight such inhibitors is described. The most potent &#946;-strand mimic prepared was 2.13. This was determined to have an IC&#8325;&#8320; of 30 nM against calpain II. Chapter 3 outlines the history and application of ring closing metathesis (RCM) to the synthesis of cyclic compounds. The attempted synthesis of an eight membered cyclic nitrogen to nitrogen conformationally constrained dipeptide is described. The synthesis of a conformationally constrained &#946;-amino acid calpain inhibitor (3.73) is also described. A novel calpain inhibitor motif was designed in Chapter 4. On the basis of this an in-silico combinatorial library of two hundred and eighty eight possible &#946;-strand templates was prepared. Conformational analysis of this library was performed and from this a number of excellent &#946;-strand templates were identified and selected for synthesis. The preparation of ten &#946;-strand templates is described. New microwave irradiation methodology was developed to achieve this. vii The formation of a six-membered catalyst deactivating chelate is also proposed to explain why some dienes fail to undergo RCM. Two methods to circumvent the formation of such a chelate are outlined. The addition of Lewis acid chloro-dicyclohexyl borane to the RCM reaction mixture and chain length alteration are investigated. Chapter 5 describes the design of macrocyclic &#946;-strand mimics using induced fit molecular modelling. The physicochemical properties of these were calculated in-silico. From this analysis a number of Tyr-XX-Gly based and Tyr-XX-Cys based macrocyclic calpain inhibitors were selected for synthesis. The preparation and testing of these are described. In the Tyr-XX-Gly macrocyclic system a number of variables were investigated and numerous SAR implications concluded. Aldehyde 5.14 was identified as the best electrophilic warhead macrocyclic calpain inhibitor with an IC&#8325;&#8320; against calpain II of 27 nM. The best non-electrophilic warhead macrocycle (5.13) had an IC&#8325;&#8320; against calpain II of 704 nM. Chapter 6 describes synthetic optimisation for the preparation of calpain inhibitors 2.13, 5.14 and 5.17. Multi-gram quantities of each were prepared. Aldehydes 2.13 and 5.14 were evaluated as anti-cataract agents using in-vivo cataract sheep model. Both of these &#946;-strand mimics were demonstrated to retard cataract development. Macrocycle 5.14 was found to be the most effective, decreasing the rate of cataract development between forty four and forty nine per cent relative to control. Chapter 7 outlines the attempted development of RCM methodology for the chiral synthesis of &#945;-&#945; disubstituted amino acid lactams. In addition, methodology for the stereoselective incorporation of a C-N constrained &#946;-amino acid carbocycle into a peptide or peptidomimetic is described.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beta-strand</field><field name="subject">Peptidomimetics</field><field name="subject">drug design</field><field name="subject">calpain inhibitors</field><field name="subject">protease inhibitors</field><field name="subject">computational chemistry</field><field name="subject">molecular modeling</field><field name="subject">ADME</field><field name="subject">Cataract</field><field name="subject">anti-cataract drugs</field><field name="subject">Beta-strand mimic</field><field name="subject">SAR</field><field name="subject">structure activity relationships</field><field name="subject">RCM</field><field name="subject">ring closing metathesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paleoenvironmental Interpretations of the Lower Taylor Group, Olympus Range area, southern Victoria Land, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Gilmer, Greer Jessie</field><field name="description">The Devonian Taylor Group, in the Olympus Range area, southern Victoria Land (SVL), Antarctica, is separated from the basement by a regional nonconformity (Kukri Erosion Surface). A second localized unconformity within the Taylor Group called the Heimdall Erosion Surface separates the New Mountain Sandstone and older units from the younger Altar Mountain Formation. The depositional environment of the New Mountain Sandstone has long been under contention.  The New Mountain Sandstone Formation is a predominantly quartzose cross-bedded sandstone. Its newly defined Mt Jason Member is a coarse arkosic small scale cross-bedded pebbly sandstone that grades up section into the rest of the quartzose New Mountain Sandstone with large scale cross beds. The New Mountain Sandstone has been divided into five lithofacies including the Basal Conglomerate Lithofacies, Pebbly Sandstone Lithofacies, Granule Cross-bedded Lithofacies, Pinstripe Cross-bedded Lithofacies and Cross-bedded Sandstone Lithofacies. Deposition was in a shoreface environment with minor coastal aeolian deposition. The environment changed from upper shoreface to lower shoreface up section, forming transgressive to highstand systems tracts. The Heimdall Erosion Surface truncates the Cross-bedded Sandstone Lithofacies and the Pinstripe Cross-bedded Lithofacies and was formed due to relative sea level fall leading to exposure and erosion of underlying sedimentary and basement rocks. It forms a type 1 sequence boundary. The New Mountain Sandstone was partially or totally lithified before erosion as shown by the jagged morphology of the eroded cross beds on the surface. It is not known when cementation of the NMS took place or how much of the formation has been eroded. The Heimdall Erosion Surface and Kukri Erosion Surface converge locally due to erosion on the Heimdall Erosion Surface and relief on the Kukri Erosion Surface. The Heimdall Erosion Surface became a shore platform and the site of deposition as relative sea level rose. The Altar Mountain Formation with its Odin Member is a cross-bedded, massive and bedded feldspathic and quartzose sandstone that fines up section and is deposited on the erosion surface. The Altar Mountain Formation is divided into four lithofacies including the Conglomerate Lithofacies, Trough Cross-bedded Lithofacies, Cross-bedded Bioturbated Lithofacies and Bedded Fine Lithofacies. Deposition was in a shoreface environment, changing up section to an inner shelf environment with minor estuarine/tidal influence near the top of the section forming transgressive to highstand to regressive system tracts. The sedimentary rocks are derived mainly from the Granite Harbour Intrusives and Koettlitz Group, which underlie the sandstones, but were exposed elsewhere in SVL. The sandstone clasts within the Conglomerate Lithofacies could be derived from underlying older Taylor Group rocks or exotic sources from outside the field area.  Correlation with data from adjacent areas suggests deposition of the New Mountain Sandstone occurred in a shallow sea that existed from the Olympus Range, southwards into the Asgard Range and included Vashka Crag. The area around Sponsors Peak and to the north was exposed and supplying feldspathic and quartzose sediment and pebbles into the depositional basin. As relative sea level fell due to either tectonic uplift or eustatic processes a large area of southern Victoria Land was exposed including the Olympus and Asgard Ranges and Bull Pass-St Johns Range area. This lead to erosion of the New Mountain Formation and basement rocks. Deposition of the New Mountain Sandstone continued further south shown by the gradational contact between it and the overlying Altar Mountain Formation. Relative sea level rise led to deposition of the Altar Mountain Formation. Shallow seas once more dominated the southern Victoria Land with deltas in the east (in the Bull Pass-St Johns Range area) feeding feldspathic sediment into the depositional basin (Odin Member). Further sea level rise drowned the delta region and a shallow marine to inner shelf environment led to deposition of the rest of the Altar Mountain Formation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beacon Supergroup</field><field name="subject">Taylor Group</field><field name="subject">sedimentary</field><field name="subject">dry valleys</field><field name="subject">provenance</field><field name="subject">sandstone</field><field name="subject">paeloenvironment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of phages infecting gram positive food bacteria</field><field name="creator">Lee, Wan-Jing</field><field name="description">Bacteriophage (phage), virus of bacteria, has been proposed as a mean to inactivate bacteria that are pathogens of humans. Applied prophylatically to food, phage might decrease the numbers of potential pathogens we ingest. Much active research on using the phages of bacteria to control Gram negative foodborne pathogens are described in the literatures, but comparatively little research describes the phages of Gram positive bacteria and their use as biocontrol agents on food. In this work, previous undescribed phages, able to infect Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes, were isolated from soil and ruminants faecal material, respectively. As the first step in assessing their potential as biocontrol agents, the isolated phages were purified, concentrated and characterised (albeit to different degrees). The Bacillus phages had a narrow host range while the Listeria phages had a broad host range. Listeria phages also infected L. monocytogenes 2000/47, a strain which recurs in New Zealand clinical cases. Both Bacillus and Listeria phages appeared to be of the Myoviridae family judging by their structure in electron micrographs. The Bacillus FWLBc1 and FWLBc2 phages were lytic phages with a latent period of 106 and 102 min at 37&#176;C, and an average burst size of 322 and 300 phages per infected cell, respectively. Moreover, they both had genomes of approximately 134 kb. All newly isolated and characterized phages were chloroform resistant and survived storage better at 4&#176;C than at room or freezing temperatures. Bacillus phages significantly reduced the bacterial population in mashed potatoes within 24 h at room temperature, when applied at a phage to host ratio of 1000. Listeria phages rapidly inactivated the host population to a low optical density. The findings of this thesis will add to the current knowledge of phages in the context of various environmental conditions for different bacteria and will demonstrate the potential of phages as food safety biocontrol agents.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bacteriophages</field><field name="subject">gram positive</field><field name="subject">Listeria</field><field name="subject">Bacillus</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arboreal Eloquence: Trees and Commemoration</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Jo-anne Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the use of trees for commemoration and the memory that they have anchored in the landscape.  There has been little written on the use of trees for commemorative purposes despite its symbolic resonance over the last 150 years.  To determine the extent to which commemorative trees have been employed, the social practice and context in which the trees were planted, field and archival work was undertaken in New Zealand and Australia.  This has been supported with some comparative work using examples from Britain and the United States of America.  The research also utilizes the new availabilities of records on-line and the community interests that placed historical and contemporary material on-line. The commemorative tree has been a popular commemorative marker for royal events, the marking of place and as memorial for war dead.  It has been as effective an anchor of memory in the landscape as any other form.  The memory ascribed to these trees must be understood in terms of the era in which the tree was planted and not just from a distance. Over time the memory represented by the trees and its prescribed meanings, has changed.  For all its power and fragility, memory is not permanent but nor is it so ephemeral as to exhibit no robustness at all.  Instead memory exists in a state of instability that leaves it open to challenge and to constant reassessment based on the needs of the viewing generation.  This instability also allows the memory, and thus the tree, to fade and become part of the domestic landscape of treescape memories (Cloke and Pawson, 2008).  However, in some circumstances trees are retrieved and reinscribed with specific memory and made relevant for a new generation.  The landscape created by commemorative trees is, therefore, multifunctional, in which social relations support memory, remembrance, forgetting, silences, erasures, and memory slippage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commemorative trees</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">royalty</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">Arbor Day</field><field name="subject">memorial avenues</field><field name="subject">First World War</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Ring Laser Gyroscopes</field><field name="creator">Rabeendran, Nishanthan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of a 1.6 metre square, helium-neon based ring laser gyroscope (denoted PR-1). This device is mounted on one of the internal walls of a high rise building. After optimisation a cavity Q of 2.9x10&#185;&#185; and a sensitivity to rotation of approximately 10&#8315;&#179; of the background Earth bias was obtained. A detailed investigation of the single mode operating regime and multi-mode thresholds was undertaken and could be well accounted for with a simple model of the gain curves. A key feature of the operation of PR-1 is persistent longitudinal mode hopping. It is shown that by running the laser at selective high powers, one obtains CW mode locked operation thereby negating the influence of mode hopping and allowing for long time data acquisition. PR-1 was used to demonstrate oscillation of the Rutherford building on its second fundamental mode during an earthquake. In a separate investigation, a range of supermirrors were studied to determine the optimum configuration in a 4 by 4 metre ring laser. The set with the highest finesse prevailed despite the comparatively low light levels on the photo detectors. The geometric stability of the lasers was not found to be a significant factor.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ring laser</field><field name="subject">gyroscopes</field><field name="subject">laser gyroscopes</field><field name="subject">rotation sensor</field><field name="subject">rotation detector</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic effects in ring lasers and transverse mode selection in helium-neon lasers.</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Duncan Peter</field><field name="description">The effect of seismic activity on large ring laser gyroscopes is determined. In particular the novel use of ring laser gyros as detectors of the rotational components of earthquake waves is investigated. It is found that lasers such as C-II which are well isolated from mechanical strain of the ground are effectively sensitive only to the rotational components of seismic waves. Tilt and bulk strain in the laser body are found to be negligible. Fourier analysis of earthquake data from C-I gives very good agreement with the modelled effects. The use of the auto-regressive AR(2) model as a superior alternative to Fourier analysis is investigated. It is found that such an approach is much more sensitive and gives access to a hitherto unavailable parameter, the Sagnac linewidth. The effects on the Sagnac frequency and its linewidth are found to be in excellent agreement with earthquake data recorded from the laser C- II. Microseismic noise induced in the ground by oceanic wave action on coastlines and the possible effects on ring laser noise levels are determined. It is found that typical amplitudes of microseismic waves are many orders of magnitude too weak to be manifested in frequency spectra of ring laser gyroscopes and lie far below the ultimate quantum noise limit for such lasers. A model is developed of helium-neon lasers operating at 632.8 nm to determine the radial distribution of the population inversion density. The simplest model, requiring the least number of atomic levels to be included, is found which will account for the induction of a central minimum in the distribution due to increasing pumping rate. An extension of the gain expression for laser modes is used to determine the gains for different transverse modes. The expected variations of the first and last oscillating transverse modes in a purpose built linear laser, L1, are found to be in good agreement with the model. With the inclusion of astigmatism the model is extended to ring lasers and the expected mode behaviour is predicted and recommendations for the operation of such lasers is made. The behaviour of very large ring lasers, with perimeters of tens of metres, are investigated. A description of the design and commissioning of the large high-quality linear laser, designated Ll is given.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration in Pinus radiata and Populus deltoides to changing environmental conditions</field><field name="creator">Ow, Lai Fern</field><field name="description">Although it has long been recognized that physiological acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration can occur in plants exposed to changing environmental conditions (e.g. light, temperature or stress), the extent of acclimation in different tissues (i.e. pre-existing and new foliage) however, has not received much attention until recently. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the extent of photosynthetic and respiratory acclimation under natural conditions, where air temperatures vary diurnally and seasonally. In this study, the effects of variations in temperature on respiratory CO2 loss and photosynthetic carbon assimilation were examined under both controlled and natural environments. The purpose of the investigations described in this thesis was to identify the effects acclimation would have on two key metabolic processes in plants exposed to temperature change, with emphasis also placed on the role of nutrition (nitrogen) and respiratory enzymatic characteristics on the potential for acclimation in two contrasting tree species, Pinus radiata and Populus deltoides. Controlled-environment studies (Chapter 2 and 3) established that rates of foliar respiration are sensitive to short-term changes in temperature (increasing exponentially with temperature) but in the longer-term (days to weeks), foliar respiration acclimates to temperature change. As a result, rates of dark respiration measured at any given temperature are higher in cold-acclimated and lower in warm-acclimated plants than would be predicted from an instantaneous response. Acclimation in new foliage (formed under the new temperature environment) was found to result in respiratory homeostasis (i.e. constant rates of foliar respiration following long-term changes in temperature, when respiration is measured at the prevailing growth temperature). Available evidence suggests that substantial adjustments in foliar respiration tend to be developmentally dependent. This may in part explain why respiratory homeostasis was only observed in new but not in pre-existing tissues. Step changes in temperature (cold and warm transfers) resulted in significant changes in photosynthetic capacity. However, in stark contrast to the findings of respiration, there was little evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to temperature change. The results obtained from field studies (Chapter 4) show that in the long-term over a full year, dark respiration rates in both tree species were insensitive to temperature but photosynthesis retained its sensitivity, increasing with increasing temperature. Respiration in both species showed a significant downregulation during spring and summer and increases in respiratory capacity were observed in autumn and winter. Thermal acclimation of respiration was associated with a change in the concentration of soluble sugars. Hence, acclimation of dark respiration under a naturally changing environment is characterized by changes in the temperature sensitivity and apparent capacity of the respiratory apparatus. The results from controlled and natural-environment studies were used to drive a leaflevel model (which accounted for dark respiratory acclimation) with the aim of forecasting the overall impact of responses of photosynthesis and respiration in the long term (Chapter 5). Modellers utilise the temperature responses of photosynthesis and respiration to parameterize carbon exchange models but often ignore acclimation and use only instantaneous responses to drive such models. The studies here have shown that this can result in erroneous estimates of carbon exchange as strong respiratory acclimation occurs over longer periods of temperature change. For example, it was found here that the failure to factor for dark respiratory acclimation resulted in the underestimation of carbon losses by foliar respiration during cooler months and an overestimation during warmer months - such discrepancies are likely to have an important impact on determinations of the carbon economy of forests and ecosystems. The overall results substantiate the conclusion that understanding the effect of variations in temperature on rates of carbon loss by plant respiration is a prerequisite for predicting estimates of atmospheric CO2 release in a changing global environment. It has been shown here that within a moderate range of temperatures, rate of carbon uptake by photosynthesis exceeds the rate of carbon loss by plant respiration in response to warming as a result of strong respiratory acclimation to temperature change. This has strong implications for models which fail to account for acclimation of respiration. At present, respiration is assumed to increase with increasing temperatures. This erroneous assumption supports conclusions linking warming to the reinforcement of the greenhouse effect.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acclimation</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">respiration</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="subject">environmental conditions</field><field name="subject">tissues</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viscosity and Density of Reference Fluid</field><field name="creator">Almotari, Masaed Moti M</field><field name="description">The viscosity and density of bis(8-methylnonyl) benzene-1,2- dicarboxylate {diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP)}, with a nominal viscosity at T = 298 K and p = 0.1 MPa of 87 mPa&#8226;s, have been measured at temperatures from (298.15 to 423.15) K and pressures from (0.1 to 70) MPa.

Through theoretical considerations and tests with artificial data sets, e.g., the iteration of the logistic map, suitable parameters are determined for the application of the statistical entropy measures sample entropy (SE) and R&#233;nyi entropy (RE) to methane (a long-lived stratospheric tracer) data from simulations of the SOCOL chemistry-climate model.  The SE is shown to be useful for quantifying the variability of recurring patterns in a time series and is able to identify tropical patterns similar to those reported by previous studies of the ``tropical pipe'' region. However, the SE is found to be unsuitable for use in polar regions, due to the non-stationarity of the methane data at extra-tropical latitudes. It is concluded that the SE cannot be used to analyse climate complexity on a global scale.  The focus is turned to the RE, which is a complexity measure of probability distribution functions (PDFs). Using the second order RE and a normalisation factor, zonal PDFs of ten consecutive days of methane data are created with a Bayesian optimal binning technique. From these, the RE is calculated for every day (moving 10-day window). The results indicate that the RE is a promising tool for identifying stratospheric mixing barriers. In Southern Hemisphere winter and early spring, RE produces patterns similar to those found in other studies of stratospheric mixing. High values of RE are found to be indicative of the strong fluctuations in tracer distributions associated with relatively unmixed air in general, and with gradients in the vicinity of mixing barriers, in particular. Lower values suggest more thoroughly mixed air masses. The analysis is extended to eleven years of model data. Realistic inter-annual variability of some of the RE structures is observed, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. By calculating a climatological mean of the RE for this period, additional mixing patterns are identified in the Northern Hemisphere. The validity of the RE analysis and its interpretation is underlined by showing that qualitatively similar patterns can be seen when using observational satellite data of a different tracer. Compared to previous techniques, the RE has the advantage that it requires significantly less computational effort, as it can be used to derive dynamical information from model or measurement tracer data without relying on any additional input such as wind fields. The results presented in this thesis strongly suggest that the RE is a useful new metric for analysing stratospheric mixing and its variability from climate model data. Furthermore, it is shown that the RE measure is very robust with respect to data gaps, which makes it ideal for application to observations. Hence, using the RE for comparing observations of tracer distributions with those from model simulations potentially presents a novel approach for analysing mixing in the stratosphere.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atmosphere</field><field name="subject">stratosphere</field><field name="subject">atmospheric dynamics</field><field name="subject">atmospheric analysis</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">entropy</field><field name="subject">R&#233;nyi entropy</field><field name="subject">complexity measures</field><field name="subject">butterfly effect</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">climate model</field><field name="subject">SOCOL</field><field name="subject">statistical entropy</field><field name="subject">complex system</field><field name="subject">chaos theory</field><field name="subject">logistic map</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infrared studies of gas absorption on germanium.</field><field name="creator">Howe, Russell Francis</field><field name="description">An experimental method has been developed for observing the infrared spectra of molecules adsorbed on germanium surfaces.

The interaction of carboxylic aids with germanium surfaces has been studied; the observed spectra are interpreted in terms of formation of surface germanium carboxylates. The oxidation of germanium surfaces has been found to involve formation of at least three distinct species. A preliminary study has been made of alcohol adsorption; the observed spectra suggest hydrogen bonding of undissociated alcohol molecules to the surface.

In most cases, this involves the construction of a climate/viticulture based model which is then applied to a potential region. Although these climatic based models may perform well inside their original regions, they tend to fail elsewhere. Discrepancies between climatic indexes have been attributed to many factors including vineyard management, grapevine variety, phenology/climate misconceptions and regional macro/mesoclimate regimes. The aim of this study is to investigate the viticulture potential within two regions of the South Island of New Zealand, by implementing several climatic based models. These models have been designed to improve the predictive accuracy over other current climatic/viticulture models. A GIS, along with climatic data collected from over 80 stations within Canterbury and the surrounding region, are incorporated into several models which are used within this project as viticultural tools to improve the current understanding between topographic, climatic and grapevine relationships. Viticulture potential ratings are then assessed for two overlapping regions; the smaller sub-region of the lower Waipara catchment and the larger Canterbury region. Results show that many of the current vineyard plots in the Canterbury and lower Waipara regions do not fall within the optimal limits of the models, while there are large potential areas in both regions yet to be utilized for viticulture. However, not all of Canterbury and the lower Waipara catchment can be used for viticulture due to several limiting factors such as elevation, risk of frosts and low mean temperatures. Surprisingly, most of the Canterbury Plains fall within this 'no go' area. The model has proved to be a much more reliable tool than other existing climatic indexes such as the widely used degreeday and mean temperature of the warmest month indices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">n/a</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in endometrial cancer cells by food compounds</field><field name="creator">Dann, James MacBeth</field><field name="description">Endometrial cancer is one of the most significant gynaecological malignancies that affect women from New Zealand and the rest of the world. One of the critical stages in the development of a tumour is the onset of hypoxia. The malignancy responds by having raised levels of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) that in turn induces increased production of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). VEGF is a potent angiogenic factor that will mediate vascular supply of nutrients and oxygen to the developing tumour. The aim of this study was to investigate whether two compounds found in extracts of plant materials, Resveratrol (Resveratrol) and Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), altered the levels of VEGF in the supernatant of cultured endometrial cancer cells. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin that is found in many foods, such as grapes, nuts and berries, as well as in high concentrations in some red wines. 100 &#181;M of resveratrol was added to cell cultures for 24 hours. VEGF levels in the supernatant were then analysed using ELISA. Resveratrol was found to have significant inhibitory effects in both primary endometrial cancer cell cultures and immortalised endometrial cancer cell cultures. Resveratrol was also shown to reverse the increase in VEGF caused by the hypoxia mimic cobalt chloride (CoCl&#8322;). Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is an antioxidant catechin extracted from green tea. The effect of EGCG was analysed using the same method as for resveratrol. 100 &#181;M of EGCG was also shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on the level of VEGF in the supernatant of cultured endometrial cancer cells, as well as reducing the effect of CoCl&#8322;. These results suggest that selected food compounds, resveratrol and EGCG, can reduce VEGF levels by inhibiting HIF.

Conducting analysis with appropriately chosen methods, in terms of quality of performance and results, computation time, flexibility and applicability to data of various natures, will help decision making in the policy development and management process for environmental studies. This thesis has three fundamental aims and motivations. Firstly, to develop a flexibly applicable attribute selection method, Tree Node Selection (TNS), and a decision tree assessment tool, Tree Node Selection for assessing decision tree structure (TNS-A), both of which use decision trees pre-generated by the widely used C4.5 decision tree algorithm as their information source, to identify important attributes from data. TNS helps the cost effective and efficient data collection and policy making process by selecting fewer, but important, attributes, and TNS-A provides a tool to assess the decision tree structure to extract information on the relationship of attributes and decisions. Secondly, to introduce the use of new, theoretical or unknown computer algorithms, such as the K-Maximum Subarray Algorithm (K-MSA) and Ant-Miner, by adjusting and maximizing their applicability and practicality to assess environmental science problems to bring new insights. Additionally, the unique advanced statistical and mathematical method, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), is demonstrated as a data pre-processing method to help improve C4.5 results on noisy measurements. Thirdly, to promote, encourage and motivate environmental scientists to use ideas and methods developed in this thesis. The methods were tested with benchmark data and various real environmental science problems: sea container contamination, the Weed Risk Assessment model and weed spatial analysis for New Zealand Biosecurity, air pollution, climate and health, and defoliation imagery. The outcome of this thesis will be to introduce the concept and technique of data mining, a process of knowledge discovery from databases, to environmental science researchers in New Zealand and overseas by collaborating on future research to achieve, together with future policy and management, to maintain and sustain a healthy environment to live in.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algorithm</field><field name="subject">attribute selection</field><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Discovery</field><field name="subject">environmental science problmes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DDoS detection based on traffic self-similarity</field><field name="creator">Brignoli, Delio</field><field name="description">Distributed denial of service attacks (or DDoS) are a common occurrence on the internet and are becoming more intense as the bot-nets, used to launch them, grow bigger. Preventing or stopping DDoS is not possible without radically changing the internet infrastructure; various DDoS mitigation techniques have been devised with different degrees of success. All mitigation techniques share the need for a DDoS detection mechanism. DDoS detection based on traf&#64257;c self-similarity estimation is a relatively new approach which is built on the notion that undis- turbed network traf&#64257;c displays fractal like properties. These fractal like properties are known to degrade in presence of abnormal traf&#64257;c conditions like DDoS. Detection is possible by observing the changes in the level of self-similarity in the traf&#64257;c &#64258;ow at the target of the attack. Existing literature assumes that DDoS traf&#64257;c lacks the self-similar properties of undisturbed traf&#64257;c. We show how existing bot- nets could be used to generate a self-similar traf&#64257;c &#64258;ow and thus break such assumptions. We then study the implications of self-similar attack traf&#64257;c on DDoS detection. We &#64257;nd that, even when DDoS traf&#64257;c is self-similar, detection is still possible.

Formulaicity constitutes an essential feature of language production and comprehension, and phrasal vocabulary plays a central role in everyday language usage. This research study replicates the experimental design carried out in the study Acquiring phrasal vocabulary by Kuiper, Columbus, &amp; Schmitt (to appear), which used a cloze procedure to test three main hypotheses: a) There are significant differences between the degree of acquisition of formulaic language items by native and non-native speakers of English; b) The frequency of usage of the head-verbs contained in verb plus complement formulaic sequences is positively correlated with the acquisition of such sequences; and, c) Phrasal vocabulary is age graded. In the present study the target language is Spanish instead of English. In addition, available evidence suggests that cultural integration seems to be linked to the acquisition of formulaic language. Thus, a questionnaire intended to measure the participants&#8217; cultural integration level to the target language community was developed. The results of this study supported the predictions that the amount of formulaic language acquired by native speakers is positively correlated with age, and that non-native speakers&#8217; phrasal vocabulary is significantly less extensive than that of native speakers. Most importantly, the results also showed a significant effect of verb frequency on the participants&#8217; acquaintance with the formulaic sequences tested.  However, the prediction that cultural integration would be positively correlated with the number of correct answers in the cloze test for both groups was not supported. Extending to the Spanish language the results reported by Kuiper, Columbus, &amp; Schmitt supports the argument that the processes of acquisition of formulaic language across diverse linguistics systems function in a very similar way (Corpas Pastor, 2003). A better comprehension of the mechanisms by which speakers acquire formulaic language may significantly contribute to the development of an appropriate methodology to teach phrasal vocabulary to second language learners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phrasal vocabulary, Formulaic language, Phraseology, Language acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music Perception of Cochlear Implant Users</field><field name="creator">Looi, V</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring natural progression of dysphagic symptoms in stroke</field><field name="creator">Erne, Claudia</field><field name="description">Swallowing difficulties after acute stroke are common. Clinical bedside assessments are used frequently to detect acute dysphagia. Published studies which have assessed the natural history of swallowing using bedside assessments have only observed swallowing for a short period of time. The purpose of this investigation was to monitor the natural progression of dysphagic symptoms in stroke over three month using a clinical assessment. 26 patients consecutively admitted to the regional public hospital were assessed using a clinical assessment consisting of cranial nerve exam, observation of oral intake, water swallow test and inhalation cough challenge. The assessment was implemented within 72 hours post admission and then after one week, three weeks and three months. For this exploratory study, descriptive statistics were used to explore the data set. The results confirm that dysphagia after stroke is common and that there are improvements within three months.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Dysphagia</field><field name="subject">clinical assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nearshore Dispersal and Reproductive Viability of Intertidal Fucoid Algae : how effective is drift in local to regional dispersal?</field><field name="creator">Hawes, Nicola Ann</field><field name="description">The ecological importance of drifting will depend on the abundance of drifting algae and whether it is reproductively viable. However, the ability of adult plants to successfully disperse long-distances by drifting is largely unknown, particularly for fucoids. The abundance, species composition, and reproductive status of drifting algae was examined by transect surveys around Kaikoura and Banks Peninsula. Abundance and species composition varied between sites, but all drifting algae that were in reproductive season, and had reproductive structures intact, were reproductively active. The reproductive longevity and viability of drifting and beach-cast Hormosira banksii, Durvillaea antarctica and Cytophora torulosa was compared with attached populations. Drifting algae remained reproductively viable, and fecundity did not differ from that of attached algae. Viable propagules were released from drifting algae for the duration of the experiments (H. banksii 57 days, D. antarctica 62 days, and C. torulosa 43 days). In contrast, beach-cast algae ceased to release propagules after 14 days. Dispersal by drifting relies on offshore transport after detachment. To determine the influence of wind and tidal currents on the nearshore transport of drifting algae, tagged H. banksii, D. antarctica, C. torulosa and GPS-tracked drifters were released from shore. Drifters generally moved in the direction of the prevailing wind, but some influence of tidal direction and bathymetry was detected. Offshore winds and outgoing tides were favourable for the offshore transport of surface drifting algae. Following dispersal and arrival at new locations, the distance between gametes may be important in determining the fertilisation success of dioecious species. Experiments testing the fertilisation success of H. banksii and D. antarctica, over increasing distances, showed that fertilisation success decreased with increasing distance between male and female gametes. Despite this, eggs were fertilised when male and female gametes were up to 2m apart, and sperm remained viable for 2 hours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nearshore dispersal</field><field name="subject">Fucoid algae</field><field name="subject">Intertidal</field><field name="subject">Drift</field><field name="subject">Reproductive viability</field><field name="subject">Durvillaea</field><field name="subject">Hormosira</field><field name="subject">Cystophora</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model driven architecture based approach for developing multi-agent systems</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Di</field><field name="description">The research described in this thesis is an attempt to utilize the Model Driven Architecture for semi-automatically developing a prototype Multi-Agent System to support the management of a real container terminal. Agent technology has been increasingly applied in Transport Logistics and seems to be a viable solution to support the container terminal management. Thus, from the user point of view, the focus of this research is to investigate the applicability of Multi-Agent Systems to assist the container terminal's decision makers in improving the container terminal productivity, which is often measured in terms of the productivity of cranes. A prototype Multi-Agent System has been developed to evaluate and compare a set of proposed vehicle dispatching strategies, which are a collection of rules that a vehicle (e.g. straddle carrier) uses to decide the priority of serving the working cranes. Employing an appropriate dispatching strategy may greatly improve the efficiency of vehicle allocation to the working cranes, so as to increase the utilization of cranes which directly enhance the container terminal productivity. In order to investigate the applicability of the Multi-Agent System for supporting the container terminal management, experiments have been conducted in a variety of real-world scenarios. The experiment results have revealed that Multi-Agent Systems are applicable to assist container terminal decision makers in evaluating operating strategies. On the other hand, from the developer point of view, the author investigates how to apply the Model Driven Architecture to agent technologies, providing a partially automated support for the derivation of Multi-Agent System implementation from the agent-oriented design, independently from the target implementation platforms. The Model Driven Architecture approach studied in this research is a model-driven software development process that explicitly separates models at three different levels of abstraction: platform independent models, platform specific models, and implementation models. In contrast to the conventional code-centric software development, the Model Driven Architecture based software development uses models as the primary engineering artifacts. The adopted development approach is to take a high-level abstraction model of a system and transform it into a set of platform specific models, each of which is in turn transformed into the corresponding implementation. Transformations between models are automatically carried out by a set of transformation tools. The experience of using the Model Driven Architecture for the development of the prototype Multi-Agent System has revealed the following benefits: (a) automated transformations between models increase software productivity; (b) separating the high-level specification of the system from the underlying implementation technology improves the portability of the system's high-level abstraction model; (c) strong separation of concerns, guaranteed consistency between models, and automatic generation of source code minimize future software maintenance effort.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multi-agent systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of streams affected by acid mine drainage near Westport, South Island, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Harbrow, Michael Andrew</field><field name="description">Macroinvertebrate assemblages, physico-chemical factors, epilithic algal biomass and leaf decomposition were examined in streams draining the Charming Creek and Stockton-Millerton coalfields north of Westport, South Island. Three invertebrate community types were evident in the streams depending on the degree of contamination by acid mine drainage. A diverse (9-31 taxa) "clean water" fauna dominated by the mayfly Deleatidium, larval Elmidae and various Trichoptera and Tipulidae occurred down to pH 4.5 where iron concentration was &lt; 0.69 mg l&#8315;&#185; and aluminium &lt; 0.41 mg l&#8315;&#185;. At sites subject to moderate acid mine drainage and iron hydroxide precipitation, diversity was lower (9-13 taxa) and invertebrate density was often very low. Spaniocercoides phi/potti, a Zelandobius species and Oxyethira albiceps dominated. In the most polluted streams, where pH &lt; 3, conductivity&gt; 300-450 &#181;S cm&#8315;&#185; and metal concentrations were elevated (Fe&gt; 5.7 mgl&#8315;&#185;, Al &gt; 3.4 mg l&#8315;&#185; ) taxonomic diversity was very low (2-6 taxa) but invertebrate abundance was often very high. Chironomidae made up 80-100% ofindividuals caught. Acid streams were dominated by habitat generalists rather than specialist acidophiles. Biomass ofperiphytic algae examined experimentally in 7 streams (pH 2.8-6.2) was greatest at low pH. It appeared to be affected by precipitation of iron hydroxide, nutrient concentration and the absence ofbicarbonate below pH 5.5. Grazing by invertebrates did not appear to have a significant effect on algal biomass. Decomposition ofbeech (Nothofagus) and kamahi (Weinmannia) leaves in 6 acidic-eircumneutral streams lacking shredders was slow, and differences in decomposition rates in the contrasting streams were evident only after 6 months. As in other parts of the world, acid mine drainage has a severe effect on New Zealand stream ecology.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) Spectroscopy to the Measurement of Atmospheric Trace Gases</field><field name="creator">Crawley, Louise Helen</field><field name="description">Gaseous pollutants have been an environmental concern since 1956, when the first clean air act was established in the United Kingdom. Monitoring of gaseous emissions is a legal requirement in most countries, and this has generated a large demand for inexpensive, portable, and versatile gas analysers for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Many of the current commercial gas analysers have differing advantages and disadvantages, however, high cost is an important factor. Instruments with low detection limits and the ability to measure multiple gases tend to be very expensive, whereas, single gas analysers tend to be much more affordable. A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer, originally developed for a previous M.Sc. project, has been further developed in order to increase the sensitivity and to extend the instrument to the measurement of multiple gases. This type of instrument would be useful for environmental, industrial, and research applications. The instrument was inexpensive to construct when compared with the cost of current commercial gas analysers, is robust, and is partially portable around the laboratory. Infrared radiation from two infrared sources, pass through adjacent sample and reference cells and into corresponding detector cells. A sample comprising the analyte gas is contained in the sample cell, a non-absorbing gas, such as argon, is contained in the reference cell, and pure analyte gas of interest is contained in the detector cells. The two identical detector cells, which follow the reference and sample cells in the infrared optic paths, communicate only through a differential capacitance manometer which accurately measures small pressure differences between the otherwise identical cells. Any trace amount of the analyte gas in the sample cell absorbs radiation, depleting the appropriate infrared frequencies. This results in lower energy incident on the sample detector cell, reducing the infrared induced pressure rise in that detector cell compared to the reference side detector cell. The pressure difference is ii proportional to the concentration of absorbing gas in the sample cell, which is then determined using a calibration graph. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide calibration graphs from 40 ppm to 1000 ppm have been successfully established, and detection limits of 10.33 ppm for CO&#8322;, 8.81 ppm for N&#8322;O and 9.17 ppm for CH&#8324; were determined. Dried air samples measured using the spectrometer gave an average value of 382 &#177; 9.6 ppm which can be compared to the latest global atmospheric loading of 382.4 ppm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical applicability of adaptive speech testing : a comparison of the administration time, accuracy, efficiency and reliability of adaptive speech tests with conventional speech audiometry.</field><field name="creator">Sincock, Brenna Peggy</field><field name="description">Adaptive procedures are a common method of investigating sensory abilities in research settings; however, their use in clinical settings is more limited. Little research has been done investigating the implementation of adaptive procedures into Audiological speech tests, and to date, no studies have compared and evaluated adaptive speech tests with current clinical speech audiometry. This study investigated the advantages of using both closed-set and openset adaptive speech tests in the clinical Audiology setting, with respect to administration time, accuracy, efficiency and reliability. Preliminary testing of the two major adaptive procedures (staircase and maximum-likelihood procedures) was conducted using a selection of different parameters chosen on the basis of the results of previous research (Kaernbach, 1991; Garc&#237;a- P&#233;rez, 1998) to determine the optimal procedures and parameters for use in clinical speech tests. Focus was given to the staircase procedures, with comparisons made between tests using variations in step size &#8211; constant step sizes and larger step sizes at the beginning &#8211; and different termination criteria. It was found that both adaptive closed-set staircase tests (with both step size variations) performed similarly, whereas the adaptive open-set staircase test with larger step sizes at the beginning showed advantages over the equivalent constant step size test in terms of administration time, accuracy and efficiency. The maximum-likelihood QUEST procedure showed advantages over the staircase procedures in terms of administration time; however, the reliability of both this test and conventional speech audiometry was poor, indicating that these tests are not the most suitable tests for a clinical setting. Subsequent clinical testing of the optimal adaptive speech tests using participants with varying degrees of hearing loss found that administration time was similar between conventional speech audiometry and the adaptive closed-set staircase tests when the optimal termination criteria identified in the Preliminary Testing Phase were employed. The adaptive open-set staircase test with larger step sizes at the beginning showed the best accuracy of any of the tests when using the pure-tone average as a reference, while the efficiency of all the adaptive staircase tests was similar. Overall, the results highlight some of the potential advantages of adaptive speech testing in the clinical Audiology setting; however, further studies are required to determine the specific parameters that achieve the best results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kin recognition and MHC discrimination in African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles.</field><field name="creator">Villinger, Jandouwe</field><field name="description">Kin-recognition abilities, first demonstrated 25 years ago in toad tadpoles, now appear to be widespread among amphibians. In some vertebrates kin recognition is based, at least in part, on highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Besides protecting animals from disease resistance, MHC genes regulate social behaviour. They allow relatives to recognise one another so that they can cooperate for mutual benefit. These two seemingly distinct functions of MHC genes may be integrally related, because animals need to outbreed to optimise the immune systems of their offspring. The ability to discriminate MHC-type is therefore likely to facilitate kin discrimination in tadpoles. I tested association preferences of African clawed-frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles in a laboratory choice apparatus. As in other anuran species, I found that tadpoles at earlier developmental stages preferentially associate with unfamiliar siblings over unfamiliar non-siblings but that this preference reverses during development. Tadpoles approaching metamorphosis demonstrated a reversal in their preference; they preferentially school with non-kin rather than kin. The ontogenetic switch in larval schooling preferences coincides with the onset of thyroid hormone (TH) controlled development and may be indicative of decreased fitness benefits associated with schooling with kin at later developmental stages. These may result from an increase in intraspecific competition, predation, or disease susceptibilities of prometamorphic individuals. Alternatively, the kin avoidance behaviours observed at later larval stages might reflect disassociative behaviour that facilitates inbreeding avoidance at reproductive maturity. This is the first study to find a shift from an association preference for kin to non-kin during amphibian larval development. Using allele-specific PCR techniques to MHC-type tadpoles, I tested association preferences among siblings based on shared MHC haplotypes. By using only full siblings in experimental tests, I controlled for genetic variation elsewhere in the genome that might influence schooling preferences. I found that X. laevis tadpoles discriminate among familiar full siblings based on differences at MHC genes. Subjects from four families preferentially schooled with MHC-identical siblings over those with which they shared no or one haplotype. Furthermore, the strength of tadpoles&#8217; MHC-assortative schooling preferences significantly correlated with amino acid differences in the peptide-binding region (PBR) of both the MHC class I and II loci. Since MHC-PBR polymorphisms determine the pool of peptides that can serve as ligands for MHC molecules, these findings support the hypothesis that MHC peptide ligands mediate MHC type discrimination. As test subjects were equally familiar with all stimulus groups, tadpole discrimination appears to involve a self-referent genetic recognition mechanism whereby individuals compare their own MHC type with those of conspecifics. I also found that non-MHC-linked genetic differences contribute to tadpole association preferences in tests that contrast MHC and kinship. Tadpoles did not discriminate between MHC-similar non-siblings and MHC-dissimilar siblings and preferentially associated with MHC-dissimilar non-siblings rather than MHC-similar non-siblings. Although the MHC may be not solely responsible for the genetically determined cues that direct tadpole association preferences, it certainly is important in facilitating discrimination among conspecifics in X. laevis tadpoles. MHC-based discrimination may be retained through ontogeny and serve to maintain MHC-polymorphisms by facilitating disassortative mating.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">XENOPUS LAEVIS</field><field name="subject">MHC</field><field name="subject">kin recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monte Carlo Investigation into Superficial Cancer Treatments of the Head and Neck</field><field name="creator">Currie, Bryn Edward</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of the investigation into the Monte Carlo simulation of superficial cancer treatments of the head and neck region. The EGSnrc system of codes for the Monte Carlo simulation of the transport of electrons and photons through a phantom representative of either a water phantom or treatment site in a patient is utilised. Two clinical treatment units are simulated using the BEAMnrc system of codes: the Varian Medical Systems Clinac&#174; 2100C accelerator for 6MeV electron fields and the Pantak Therapax SXT 150 X-ray unit for 80kV and 100kV photon fields. Depth dose, profile and isodose curves are compared against those measured from a PTW MP3 water phantom with good agreement being achieved. Quantitative dose distributions are determined for both MeV electron and kV photon fields with treatment sites containing high atomic number materials, rapidly sloping surfaces and different density interfaces. This highlights the relatively high level of dose deposition of dose in tissue-bone and tissue-cartilage interfaces in the kV photon fields. From these dose distributions DVH and dose comparators are used to assess the simulated treatment fields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">superficial</field><field name="subject">photon</field><field name="subject">electron</field><field name="subject">EGSnrc</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Upper Body Pose Recognition in Unconstrained Environments Using Haar-Disparity</field><field name="creator">Chu, Cheng-Tse</field><field name="description">In this research, an approach is proposed for the robust tracking of upper body movement in unconstrained environments by using a Haar- Disparity algorithm together with a novel 2D silhouette projection algorithm. A cascade of boosted Haar classifiers is used to identify human faces in video images, where a disparity map is then used to establish the 3D locations of detected faces. Based on this information, anthropometric constraints are used to define a semi-spherical interaction space for upper body poses. This constrained region serves the purpose of pruning the search space as well as validating user poses. Haar-Disparity improves on the traditional skin manifold tracking by relaxing constraints on clothing, background and illumination. The 2D silhouette projection algorithm provides three orthogonal views of the 3D objects. This allows tracking of upper limbs to be performed in the 2D space as opposed to manipulating 3D noisy data directly. This thesis also proposes a complete optimal set of interactions for very large interactive displays. Experimental evaluation includes the performance of alternative camera positions and orientations, accuracy of pointing, direct manipulative gestures, flag semaphore emulation, and principal axes. As a minor part of this research interest, the usability of interacting using only arm gestures is also evaluated based on ISO 9241-9 standard. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm and optimal set of interactions are useful for interacting with large displays.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">gesture recognition</field><field name="subject">human-computer interation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing adverse effects of acid mine drainage at Stockton Opencast Coalmine : a geotechnical and geochemical approach.</field><field name="creator">Connor, Liam Bonisch</field><field name="description">Stockton Opencast Coalmine has well documented acid mine drainage (AMD), which is the result of oxidation and leaching of sulfide-rich Brunner Coal Measures waste rock. This thesis investigates the potential of mitigating AMD effects through encapsulating the waste material in a wet cover system. Specifically four locally available cap-rocks have been examined being, fresh and weathered Kaiata Formation mudstones, silt pond fines (SPF) and weathered Berlins Porphyry. These materials are tested in the laboratory, geotechnically, using grain size analysis, Atterberg limits, double-ring infiltrometer, and slake durability and geochemically, using paste pH, net acid producing potential, kinetic net acid generation, and free draining leachate columns. Field trials, using 10 m x 10 m small-scale capped waste dump pads, and computer modelling predictions, have then been applied to make recommendations on the wet cover design best suited to Stockton Coalmine. The geotechnical tests indicate the two Kaiata mudstone materials tested have the most satisfactory properties for a moisture retaining cap-rock achieving permeability &gt;1 x 10&#8315;&#185;&#8304; ms&#8315;&#185; after compaction. The Berlins Porphyry also displays geotechnical properties suitable for capping (permeability &gt;1 x 10&#8315;&#8312; ms&#8315;&#185;) after compaction, but the SPF prove least favourable in geotechnical characteristics (permeability ~2 x 10&#8315;&#8311; ms&#8315;&#185; with the addition of cement kiln dust). The geochemical data identifies the weathered Berlins Porphyry as minimally acid producing, the SPF as potentially acid forming (PAF), and both Kaiata samples as high PAF which is a significant factor in wet cover design. The leachate data from the field trials indicated that the 1 m thick compacted Kaiata mudstone capped field trial (both fresh and weathered), and the 1 m SPF plus cement kiln dust capped field trial, performed the most efficiently in reducing acidity levels and associated metals, followed by the 1 m thick compacted Berlins Porphyry cap-rock. The O&#8322;% profiles indicated that the compacted weathered Kaiata mudstone with the addition of topsoil slowed oxygen diffusion most effectively, followed by the 1 m compacted fresh Kaiata cap and the 1m uncompacted weathered Kaiata cap. The other tested capping regimes did not significantly affect O&#8322; ingress. The computer modelling showed that compacted Kaiata had adequate moisture retaining properties and also showed that both Berlins Porphyry and Kaiata mudstone cap saturation increases with time. It is recommended that Kaiata mudstone or the Berlins Porphyry is used as the 1 m thick caprock material. Where the Kaiata is identified as non-acid forming the mudstone should be selectively stockpiled for use in the wet cover system. DRI testing during after cap-rock compaction should be done at regular intervals to ensure permeabilities of &lt;1 x 10&#8315;&#8311; ms&#8315;&#185;  are achieved. Topsoil with a high permeability should placed on top of the cap-rock to complete the wet cover system and waste dump at approximately 20&#176; to prevent drying out of the cap-rock. This encapsulation system should result in an improved surface water quality at Stockton Opencast.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The heart of the village" : what determined the spatial distribution of North Canterbury rural schools 1850-1940?</field><field name="creator">Davies, Angela Mary Frances</field><field name="description">When the Province of Canterbury was established by the Canterbury Association its founders looked at the English system of education and saw many of its problems. Education was seen as a panacea for many of the ills of the 19th century but the system in Britain was dependent on the churches, and with the increasing population and rural-urban migration the system became overloaded. A factor which saw state involvement become essential. As the Canterbury founders wanted to avoid importing many of the British problems education was seen as a high priority. This thesis looks at how the state influenced the development of the education system in the North Canterbury Education Board region, as defined in 1900, over the period of 1850 to 1940. With the spatial distribution of elementary schools and their effects on the community being of particular interest. In Canterbury while the initial momentum originated from the aims of the founders, the rural communities took the initiative and following meetings, and some Education Board funding, they founded area schools. Attention is paid to the school as the "heart of the village" and its use for many non-educational purposes. These included utilisation as the post-office, the library, the museum and the entertainment, social and sporting centre. A special look is taken at the transport advancements which led to the loss of services in many rural areas and thus the loss of population and a decline in school rolls. This in turn led to the beginning of the school bus service in 1924 and the acceleration of the closure of many small schools as a system of consolidations took place. Many of the changes in the spatial distribution of schools in the North Canterbury region were due to the actions of the state in the passing of various regulations the first and most pivotal during the period studied, 1850-1940, being that of the 1877 Education Act. This was followed by many others, the most important dealing compulsory attendance, another factor influential in changing the map of schools in the region. From this study it can be seen that the school was regarded as being the most important feature of the community. Regardless of age or religious beliefs everyone was able to have an interest in it and the school acted as a unifying factor for the district.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for gamma ray burst neutrinos using the Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment</field><field name="creator">Harris, Pauline Lisa</field><field name="description">The Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment(RICE) located at the South Pole, is designed to detect the coherent broad-band radio Cherenkov radiation emitted when a high energy (10&#185;&#8309; to 10&#185;&#8312; eV) neutrino interacts with a nucleon in the ice.

Some of the issues refugees face include cultural shock, language difficulties, lack of established networks and often discrimination. Christchurch has a growing refugee community with their own social needs. The survey detailed in this dissertation was undertaken in response to the Canterbury Refugee Council identifying the lack of comprehensive data available for refugee resettlement outcomes in Christchurch. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the living conditions experienced by the refugee community in Christchurch. The participants were from the four main refugee groups resettled over the past decade, namely people coming from Afghanistan, Kurdistan area, Ethiopian, Somalia and Eritrea. This survey was undertaken at a time when international literature concludes that refugees are one of the most vulnerable groups in society and emphasises the vital role that housing alongside other factors have on positive resettlement outcomes. A quantitative approach was adopted to gather information rather than test hypotheses; it was designed to investigate housing, neighbourhood and sources of income. It also included what, if any, social support is available from the wider community, and explored some of the main current problems faced by the refugee families. The survey concludes that despite good intentions and some successes, there are still many obstacles for refugees resettling into their new environment. Refugees continue to experience chronic unemployment and struggle to access suitable housing for their families. The issues raised in this survey highlight the importance of acknowledging and responding to refugee diversity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">income</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into EPID Flood Fields Independent from the Linear Accelerator Beam</field><field name="creator">Satory, Philip Reynard</field><field name="description">The EPID (electronic portal imaging device) was designed for in vivo imaging of patients during radiotherapy treatment.  The ability of EPIDs to promptly acquire two dimensional data, lends them to be considered for use in quality assurance of the linac.  This thesis set out to investigate the possibility of using a radionuclide, technetium 99 m (Tc99m), to produce a flood field for the calibration of an EPID, because using a beam calibrated EPID to measure the beam is self-referential.  The difference in relative response between the energy spectrum of a 6MV beam and the Tc99m was investigated using EGSNRC DoseXYZ Monte Carlo Modelling.  The relative output ratio was calculated to be less than 1.6%.  The dose response of the EPID with respect to dose rate was checked using different activities of Tc99m and found to be linear.  The flatness from a phantom was calculated, with a model in MATLAB, for a range of heights, overlaps, thickness, and deformations, to find the optimum balances between signal strength and flatness.  This model was checked for accuracy using diagnostic radiographic film. The culmination of the energy response, linearity and the calculated flatness is a flood field taken with a flood phantom on the EPID with low signal strength.  To get a signal to noise ratio of 3% the mean of over 2000 flood field images were used.  This accuracy was not adequate for clinical use but the averaging of pixels it is accurate enough for QA.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imaging systems in medicine</field><field name="subject">Radiotherapy -- Equipment and supplies</field><field name="subject">EPID</field><field name="subject">flood field</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing the Substrate Specificity of 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-Heptulosonate 7-Phosphate Synthase and 3-Deoxy-D-manno-Octulosonate 8-Phosphate Synthase using Analogues of Phosphoenolpyruvate</field><field name="creator">Cumming, Hemi Adam</field><field name="description">3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) synthase and 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonate 8-phosphate (KD08P) synthase are two bacterial enzymes that are vital for host virulence. DAH7P synthase catalyses the first commited step of the shikimate pathway that results in the biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites. KD08P synthase catalyses the formation of the sugar KDO, which is an essential component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. The enzymes that catalyse these reactions are not present in animals, and therefore they are attractive targets for anti-bacterial agents. Interestingly, these two enzymes catalyse very similar aldol-like reactions and share a common substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In this thesis, the synthesis of various analogues to the shared substrate, PEP, has been described. Alterations to PEP include; substitution of a vinylic proton for either a fluorine, a bromine, a chlorine, a methyl group or deuterium; substitution of the carboxylic acid group for a methylchloride or a phosphonate; reduction of the double bond, and substituting the phosphate bridging oxygen for a methylene group. These analogues were tested as competitive inhibitors, and some as substrates and irreversible inhibitors against DAH7P synthase (from E. coli) and KD08P synthase (from N. meningitidis). 3-FluoroPEP was observed to act as a substrate for both DAH7P synthase and KD08P synthase. However, following the reaction progress via &#185;&#8313;F NMR spectroscopy showed that in the KD08P synthase reaction the (Z)-isomer was processed much slower than the (E)isomer, whereas in the DAH7P synthase reaction both isomers were processed at a similar rate. Chloro, bromo and methyl 3-substituted PEP analogues were found to be reasonable competitive inhibitors of DAH7P synthase and KD08P synthase . DAH7P synthase was shown to have better inhibition with the (E)-isomers of these 3-substituted PEP analogues, whereas in KD08P synthase this varied. l-(Chloromethyl)vinyl phosphate was shown to be a poor competitive inhibitor of both DAH7P synthase and KD08P synthase. However, this compound showed time-dependent covalent inactivation of both DAH7P synthase and KD08P synthase. DiphosphoPEP was shown to be a reasonable competitive inhibitor towards DAH7P synthase, and was a poor competitive inhibitor of KD08P synthase (at pH 6.5). Lowering the pH to 5.3 resulted in significantly greater inhibition of KD08P synthase. DiphosphoPEP was shown not to act as a substrate to both enzymes. The (R)-isomer of 2-phospholactic acid was found to be the best competitive inhibitor of DAH7P synthase, from the PEP analogues tested, and the (S)-isomer had approximately 6-fold weaker inhibition. Inhibition of KD08P synthase with 2-phospholactic acid was poor, with slightly better inhibition with the (R)-isomer. The phosphonate of PEP was shown to be a reasonable competitive inhibitor towards DAH7P synthase and close to no inhibition was observed ofKD08P synthase (at pH 6.5). Lowering the pH to 5.3 resulted in some inhibition of KD08P synthase.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steroid Estrogens and Estrogenic Activity in Farm Dairy Shed Effluents</field><field name="creator">Gadd, Jennifer Bronwyn</field><field name="description">Estrogenic contamination of waterways is of world-wide concern due to the adverse effects observed in aquatic biota. Recently, wastes from agricultural activities have been identified as likely sources of steroid estrogens released into the environment. Wastes from dairying activities are of particular concern in New Zealand. This project included development of analytical methods to measure free and conjugated estrogens, measurement of estrogens from the source to receiving environments and an investigation of effluent treatment technologies. The analytical method developed in this study was based on GC-MS measurement of free estrogens (17&#945;-estradiol (17&#945;-E2), 17&#946;-estradiol (17&#946;-E2) and estrone (E1)) and LC-IT-MS measurement of their sulfate-conjugates (17&#945;-E2-3S, 17&#946;-3S, E1-3S) in raw and treated farm dairy shed effluents (DSE). Effluents from farms in the Canterbury and Waikato Regions, two regions where dairy farming is the dominant land-use, were collected and analysed. All effluents demonstrated high concentrations of steroid estrogens, particularly 17&#945;-E2 (median 760 ng/L). Estrogenic activity was also elevated, at up to 500 ng/L 17&#946;-E2 equivalents using the E-Screen, an in vitro cell proliferation bioassay. Comparison to the chemical data indicated that for most samples, the highest proportion of estrogenic activity was derived from steroid estrogens naturally excreted by dairy cows. Conjugated estrogens were measured in several raw effluent samples, at similar concentrations to those of free estrogens, particularly E1. Dairy effluent treatment systems reduced free estrogen concentrations by 63-99% and reduced estrogenic activity by up to 89%. In spite of high removal efficiencies, estrogens remained elevated in the treated effluents that are discharged into waterways. Steroid estrogens and estrogenic activity were detected in streams and groundwater in areas impacted by dairy farming. Although concentrations were generally low, in two streams the concentrations were above levels regarded as safe for aquatic biota (&lt;1 ng/L). The results demonstrate that dairy effluents are indeed a major source of estrogens to the environment and to waterways.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogens</field><field name="subject">endocrine disruption</field><field name="subject">dairy effluent</field><field name="subject">estrogenic activity</field><field name="subject">hormones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diapause by seed predators and parasitoids in Chionochloa mast seeding communities</field><field name="creator">Sarfati, Michal</field><field name="description">Chionochloa, a genus of snow tussock grasses native to New Zealand, exhibits pronounced mast seeding. Chionochloa suffers very high levels of pre-dispersal flower and seed predation by three main insects: Eucalyptodiplosis chionochloae, a cecidomyiid midge, which is formally described here; Megacraspedus calamogonus, a gelechiid moth and Diplotoxa similis, a chloropid fly. Seven species of parasitoids that attack these seed predators were discovered. Four species parasitize M. calamogonus (one tachinid fly and three hymenopteran wasps), one parasitizes D. similis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and two parasitize E. chionochloae, (a pteromalid wasp Gastrancistrus sp. and a platygastrid wasp Zelostemma chionochloae, which is given a formal description here). The abundance, predation levels by each of the insect species, and interactions between all the organisms in the community were studied across three elevations at Mount Hutt over three summer seasons. M. calamogonus was most abundant at 450 m altitude during all three seasons. D. similis was most common at 1070 m altitude, while its predation levels peaked in low flowering seasons and decreased in high seasons. E. chionochloae was abundant in all three altitudes and increased its predation levels with increasing flowering intensity. E. chionochloae was confirmed to use prolonged diapause of at least three years. Prolonged diapause was also confirmed in its two parasitoids. Chionochloa plants were manipulated with various treatments to test the effect on diapause in E. chionochloae and its two parasitoids. Treatments included plant warming, root pruning, gibberellic acid sprayed on the plants and combinations of these treatments. All three insects changed their emergence in response to some treatments and therefore it was suggested that combined with risk-spreading diapause, they may use some predicting to emerge from prolonged diapause. E. chionochloae control their diapause following some of the cues that Chionochloa use for flowering, while Z. chionochloae and Gastrancistrus in some cases follow their host&#8217;s cues and in others use similar cues as Chionochloa plants. Emergence or diapause predictions differed across elevations and plant species in all three insect seed/flower predators. E. chionochloae had female-biased sex ratios in different populations even after prolonged diapause. There was week evidence that both parasitoid species are female-biased in the first emergence year and male-biased after more than one year in diapause. Therefore it was suggested that diapause is not more costly for females of E. chionochloae and its parasitoid than for males. Females of all three species were not found to be better predictors (i.e, more likely to respond to treatments by not entering extended diapause) than males. The complex interactions of all the organisms in this web are thought to be sensitive to climate, and it was suggested that the global climate change may alter this sensitive system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mast Seeding</field><field name="subject">Seed Predators</field><field name="subject">Megacraspedus calamogonus</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptodiplosis chionochloae</field><field name="subject">Diplotoxa similis</field><field name="subject">parasitoids</field><field name="subject">Zelostemma chionochloae</field><field name="subject">Gastrancistrus sp.</field><field name="subject">Zealachertus tortriciphaga</field><field name="subject">Diadegma sp.</field><field name="subject">Dolichogenidae sp.</field><field name="subject">Uclesiella sp.</field><field name="subject">Calitulla sp.</field><field name="subject">Predator Satitation</field><field name="subject">Prolonged Diapause</field><field name="subject">Interspecific Competition</field><field name="subject">Resource Partitioning</field><field name="subject">Sex Ratios</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maturation of Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials in Children with Normal Hearing and Hearing Impairment.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) are a non-invasive tool that can provide objective information on the functioning of the auditory pathways. As a result, there is increasing use of these measurements to support the early implantation of cochlear implants in children. However, the maturation of CAEPs in children who have received cochlear implants is still not well understood. This study investigated five children who received cochlear implants prior to 3.5 years of age and compared their CAEP waveforms to five normal-hearing children who were matched for age and five normal-hearing children who were matched for time-in-sound. In addition, a case study was completed, comparing an age-matched child who received hearing aids prior to 3.5 years of age to one of the children with cochlear implants. The latencies and amplitudes of the positive and negative peaks (P1, N1, P2, and N2) of the CAEP waveforms were measured and analysed using statistical techniques, including one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Our hypothesis was that children who received cochlear implants prior to 3.5 years of age would have CAEPs similar to their age-matched peers with normal hearing. Additionally, it was expected that the two matched children with hearing instruments would have CAEP waveforms that are similar. The measurements recorded demonstrated no conclusive results between the children with cochlear implants and either of the normal hearing groups. In the case study, the latencies and amplitudes of the child with a cochlear implant were similar to those of the child with hearing aids, supporting the second hypothesis. This study highlights the need for further research on a larger scale in order to more clearly determine the manner in which CAEP waveforms mature in children with cochlear implants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Studies of Ion-Neutral Chemistry Related to the Extraterrestrial Environment</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Samuel Joseph</field><field name="description">Kinetic data is presented for a variety of ion-neutral reactions which are relevant to the atmosphere of Titan and to the chemistry occurring in interstellar clouds. The data were recorded with a Selected Ion Flow Tube (SIFT) operating at room temperature (294 &#177; 4 K) and at a pressure of 0.46 Torr. Results of the recent Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan have identified several species in the atmosphere of Titan not predicted by pre-Cassini models of the atmosphere. In order to determine the fate of three of these species (methylenimine, propionitrile and cyanodiacetylene) in Titan's ionosphere, their reactivity with the principal ions in Titan's upper ionosphere has been examined. As expected, collision rate proton transfer reactions dominate the chemistry with association channels also observed with many of the hydrocarbon ions. The results of the Cassini mission also identified several individual reactions as being of potential importance to models of Titan's atmosphere and this chemistry has also been examined. The above studies are also relevant to the interstellar medium where each of the neutral reactants have also been detected. The results of some proton transfer equilibrium studies are also presented. The gas phase basicities of propyne and acetylene have been determined to be 681 kJ mol&#8315;&#185; and 617.4 kJ mol&#8315;&#185; respectively. Their relative proton affinities can be estimated from these values. A combined experimental/theoretical study of the proton affinity of cyanodiacetylene (HC&#8325;N) has enabled this value to be estimated at 770 &#177; 20 kJ mol&#8315;&#185;. Details of an attempt to complete the first laboratory measurement of the crucial reaction between H&#8323;&#8314; and atomic carbon are presented. The generation of atomic carbon in sufficient quantities for reaction in the SIFT was not possible with the microwave discharge source used. Other generation methods have also been explored with the laser photolysis of carbon suboxide expected to provide a possible solution to the problems encountered. The results of an investigation into the applicability of lithium ions (Li&#8314;) to SIFT-MS are presented. The lithium ions associated with each of the twenty-one neutral analytes examined to form pseudo-molecular ions. The association reactions were rapid (k ~ 10&#8315;&#8313; cm&#179; s&#8315;&#185;) for large hydrocarbons but were much slower for smaller analytes (k &lt; 10&#8315;&#185;&#185; cm&#179; s&#8315;&#185;). In order to clarify some unusual experimental observations, the effect of water molecules on the observed chemistry has been examined in detail. The measured chemistry has important consequences for the applicability of Li&#8314; to SIFT-MS where the presence and detection of an identifiable ion of the analyte is essential. Details of new SIFT operating software which can be run on a modern computer are given.

The activity of some of these Antarctic PPG areas has come into question with the proposal that they may be the result of sublimation processes rather than actively re-working freeze and thaw processes. Near surface geophysical methods of ground penetrating radar (GPR), resistivity tomography and electromagnetism have been applied to four Antarctic Dry Valleys polygonal patterned ground (PPG) areas; two in Victoria Valley and two in Beacon Valley. The aim was to resolve subsurface structure and activity of the PPG without disturbing the delicate permafrost soils. Multiple techniques were used so that there could be greater reliability on the interpretations of this data without the need for damaging subsurface geological calibration of the geophysics by obtaining direct subsurface data through methods such as trenching or drilling. Subsurface structure of the PPG was resolved; active layer depth, deformation of permafrost in the vicinity of contraction cracks and zones of attenuation were identified. Significant deformation in the subsurface horizons of the permafrost and associated with thermal contraction crack wedge growth was identified over PPG suggested to be formed only by sublimation in Beacon Valley, thus calling into question this interpretation of the PPG activity. The most reliable identification of subsurface features occurred with correlation between GPR and resistivity tomography results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration and culture : the role of Samoan churches in contemporary Aotearoa-New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Hendrikse, Edwin Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the dilemmas that the church faces today when dealing with the Samoan and New Zeala.nd born components of the New Zealand Samoan population. The generation gap between these two groups is a source of concern for both the church and the Samoan community as a whole. The thesis attempts to assess the processes of acculturation, assimilation, and ethnic segregation that mayor may not be occurring among the Samoan people in New Zealand, and assesses the growth and emergence of a new culture of Samoans in New Zealand , The New Zealand born Samoan generation " who seek to find their cultural identity with Samoans and as New Zealanders. Its purposes are threefold: Firstly, to make readers aware of the diversity of New Zealand's Multicultural Society, and highlight the importance of the church for the Samoan migrant community in maintaining and retaining Samoan language and culture in New Zealand. Secondly, to provide the Samoan Community, both Samoan born and New Zealand born Samoans, with an understanding on the development of churches of various denominations that exist to serve them in New Zealand. And thirdly, to promote the development of the New Zealand born Samoan generation who, unlike their Samoan-born parents, find themselves influenced by both their Samoan heritage and the New Zealand's multicultural society, and are thus at times caught between two cultures that can often contradict each other. It also examines the future implications in the survival of Samoan language and culture among the New Zealand born Samoan generation, who are presently already giving birth to the second generation of New Zealand born Samoans. 11 This study draws primarily on information obtained from survey research conducted within five different churches that serve the Samoan community in New Zealand's Capital City of Wellington (which, after Auckland, holds the second highest Samoan population in New Zealand). It also draws from less structured interviews with Samoans and a handful of other Pacific Islanders within the Wellington area. Through these interviews a sense of the history and growth of Samoan orientated churches in Wellington, and their contemporary activities was established. Together with survey material, these interviews enable the changes in attitudes, concerns, and views of the Samoan people who attend (and are loosely associated) with these churches to be assessed. This thesis hopes to encourage and stimulate further research and discussion on the role of Samoan and other Pacific Island Churches in AotearoafNew Zealand with regards to migration and culture, as well as provide a basis for future research to make necessary improvements on this particular study.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of temperature change on the New Zealand marine fish, Notolabrus celidotus</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Julia Kate</field><field name="description">Physiological responses of the labrid fish Notolabrus celidotus to temperature change, found thermal compensation to be more advanced in cold environmental temperatures compared to warm environmental temperatures. N. celidotus was acclimated for 28 days to 8, 14 and 24&#186;C and metabolism, ventilatory and circulatory function, condition factor, swimming ability, thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance investigated. N. celidotus acclimated to 8&#186;C almost achieved full thermal compensation, which resulted in, resting and maximum oxygen consumption not being significantly different to 14&#186;C acclimated fish. In contrast, N. celidotus acclimated to 24&#186;C achieved only partial or no metabolic thermal compensation. This resulted in high resting oxygen consumption and a reduced aerobic scope for activity, which had detrimental affects on other physiological parameters investigated.  Thermal compensation was achieved for the resting ventilation rate of the 8&#186;C acclimated fish, which is most likely needed in order to meet the high oxygen demands incurred by metabolic thermal compensation. No thermal compensation was achieved for any other ventilation rate or for heart rate, at any acclimation temperature. Thermal compensation at the level of heart and ventilation rate of the 24&#186;C acclimated fish, would have been limited by the lack of metabolic thermal compensation. A low condition factor of the 24&#186;C acclimated fish would also have occurred due to the lack of metabolic thermal compensation, which would have caused high-energy demands and the utilization of energy stores.  Thermal tolerance ranges shifted in the direction of temperature change for all acclimation groups, which indicates thermal compensation must have occurred to some degree at a variety of organizational levels. Swimming ability reflected metabolic thermal compensation, with the swimming ability of the 8&#186;C acclimated fish being similar to the 14&#186;C acclimated fish. In comparison, the 24&#186;C acclimated fish had a diminished swimming ability, which is likely to have occurred due to the reduced aerobic scope for activity of these fish and the low condition factor.  The findings suggest that the increasing temperatures associated with climate change will cause N. celidotus to migrate to cooler waters in order to survive. This response will have a large effect on New Zealand&#8217;s marine ecosystem as N. celidotus is abundant in New Zealand waters and is an important part of the food chain. Additionally, the response of N. celidotus may be an indicator of the response of other New Zealand species to climate change, which could cause huge upset to New Zealand commercial fisheries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Notolabrus celidotus</field><field name="subject">spotty</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurence of hearing loss &amp; middle ear dysfunction among primary school children in the Christchurch area.</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Phoebe Annie Patricia</field><field name="description">The present study tested the hearing of primary school children, in three different years, from four schools in the Christchurch area. 195 children participated in the study. Testing was undertaken on school grounds and children with results outside the normal range on the screening tests were offered follow-up audiological testing. The study investigated the percentage of children with a hearing loss, the type of hearing loss and whether a particular hearing loss is more common to one ethnic group than the others. The study also looked at the use of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) as a screening tool. The results were compared to those of other published studies to determine whether the children in the present study have approximately the same occurrence of hearing loss and middle ear dysfunction as other areas in the developed world. The occurrence of confirmed hearing loss was estimated at 7.6% and the occurrence of middle ear dysfunction was estimated to be 3%. Both these results were found to be consistent with previous literature. DPOAE findings were consistent with previous findings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of breath group control on the speech of normals and individuals with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Yip, Fiona Pik Ying</field><field name="description">Dysarthria is one of the most common signs of speech impairment in the cerebral palsy (CP) population.  Facilitating strategies for speech enhancement in this population often include training on speech breathing.  Treatment efficacy studies with cross-system measures in this population are needed for improved understanding and management of the interrelationship between respiratory, phonatory, and articulatory systems.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of breath group control on the coordination of articulatory and phonatory muscles and the acoustic measures related to speech and voice quality.  A simultaneous acoustic, electroglottographic (EGG), and marker-based facial tracking recording system was employed to monitor the speech production behaviors of four adults with CP and 16 neurologically healthy controls.  Subjects were instructed to perform three tasks, each containing speech targets with a voiceless plosive (/p/, /t/, or /k/) preceding a vowel (/i/, /a/, /u/, or /&#596;/).  Task 1 consisted of a short reading passage embedded with target vowels without cueing from breath group markers.  Task 2 included reading a series of monosyllabic and 3-syllable or 5-syllable non-speech words with the speech targets. Task 3 included reading the same short passage from Task 1 with cueing from breath group markers separating the passage into phrases with no more than five syllables per phrase.  Measures from the acoustic, EGG and facial tracking recordings of the first and last syllable of all syllable trains produced in the non-speech task and the target vowels in the passage reading task were examined.  Acoustic measures included voice onset time (VOT), vowel duration, fundamental frequency (F0), percent jitter (%jitter), percent shimmer (%shimmer), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequencies of Formants one and two (F1 and F2).  EGG measures included speed quotient (SQ) and open quotient (OQ).  Facial tracking measures consisted of maximum jaw displacement. Individual and averaged data were submitted to a series of two-way Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) or two-way Repeated Measures ANOVAs to determine the effects of the relative position of an utterance in the breath group and the place of articulation of the consonants involved.  In addition, mean vowel spaces derived from all three tasks were examined.  Results revealed significant changes of VOT, F1, F2, SNR and SQ as a function of position.  Significant changes of VOT, vowel duration, F2, F0, %jitter, %shimmer, and maximum jaw displacement as a function of place of articulation were also evident.  In particular, breath group control was found to result in expansion of vowel space, especially for individuals with CP.  These findings suggest that proper phrasing enhances articulatory and phonatory stability, providing empirical evidences in support of its usage in treating individuals with CP.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebral palsy</field><field name="subject">speech intelligibility</field><field name="subject">dysarthria</field><field name="subject">acoustics</field><field name="subject">jaw displacement</field><field name="subject">electroglottalgrahpy (EGG)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of freshwater communities of stock water races on the Canterbury Plains</field><field name="creator">Sinton, Amber</field><field name="description">Agricultural intensification on the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand has lead to the degradation of natural streams and rivers through lowering of water quality and significant reduction of surface flows from the use of ground and surface water resources. However, this same agricultural expansion has led to the development of a network of permanently flowing open water races to supply stock water to farms across the Canterbury Plains. Stock water races form an extensive network, with approximately 6,500 km of races. Initially I surveyed 62 water races and compared habitat characteristics, water quality, benthic invertebrate and fish communities with nearby natural streams. Races are characterised physically by straight, narrow and shallow channels, and small, uniform substrate. Water races are more turbid than natural streams, and can have high summer temperatures. The benthic macroinvertebrate communities of water races contained a range of taxa, including some not found in natural streams, but communities were less diverse than communities in natural streams, and tended to be dominated by a limited set of generalist taxa. A longitudinal study of three water races showed gradients in physical characteristics of races, including a downstream decrease in channel width, water depth, current velocity and substrate size. However, few strong longitudinal changes to community structure were found, as the generalist taxa commonly occurring in water races were able to tolerate conditions throughout the race network. To test if macroinvertebrate communities were limited by the homogeneous habitat of water races, I conducted a substrate manipulation experiment, where large cobbles and small boulders were added to reaches in five water races. Despite an increase in substrate and current heterogeneity, there were few significant changes to the macroinvertebrate communities over the four months of the manipulation. This outcome does not eliminate low habitat heterogeneity as a limiting factor for water race communities. Rather, the benthic invertebrate community throughout the water race network is a product of the homogeneous habitat, which limits the availability of colonists of taxa that would benefit from increased habitat diversity. A survey of the fish assemblages of water races found races had a depauperate fish community. Only two species were commonly found in water races, and the average species richness of races was 1.5. By contrast natural streams had a higher diversity of fish species (mean 4 three species), and contained representatives of a greater number of species that are typical of streams and rivers on the Canterbury Plains. My research has shown that stock water races provide an important source of aquatic biodiversity on the plains, both in addition to natural streams and in their own right. However, the biodiversity value of stock water races could be improved with enhancement of in-stream habitat.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensification</field><field name="subject">Canterbury Plains</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">degradation</field><field name="subject">streams</field><field name="subject">surface flows</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The benthic ecology and food web dynamics of Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere)</field><field name="creator">Wood, Hannah</field><field name="description">Coastal and shallow lakes are often subjected to eutrophication due to nutrients from catchment farming activities. Lake Ellesmere (Te Waihora) is a hyper-eutrophic lake which has gained recent attention because of concerns over its ecological health and fishery status. This study investigated the benthic ecology of the lake by extensive spatial and temporal sampling. Eight littoral sites were sampled on a single occasion, and 20 benthic sites were sampled once per season for one year. Water chemistry conditions, substrate and invertebrate communities varied significantly around the lake. Salinity, pH, DO and seston were primarily affected by freshwater inputs from inflow streams and salt water intrusion due to the lake opening to the sea. On these occasions, salinity reached 32 &#8240; at the lake outlet. The lake invertebrate community was depauperate, comprising of only two species of invertebrate predators restricted to the littoral zone and eight benthic invertebrate taxa, dominated by oligochaetes, amphipods and chironomids. Benthic invertebrate abundances also reflect the dominant local substrate, where oligochaetes and chironomids preferred areas of silt substrate, whereas Potamopyrgus preferred harder substrate. Stable isotope and gut analysis determined that the primary food sources within the lake were phytoplankton and algae. Macrophytes provided a minimal contribution to the food web, possibly relating to the change in status from a clear water, macrophyte dominated lake to a turbid, phytoplankton dominated condition since the Wahine Storm in 1968. Isotope analysis also showed that the lake food web was markedly different in its carbon values from food webs of its inflow streams and nearby marine source. However the lake food web did show a marine-derived carbon signature. A mesocosm experiment testing the effect of common lentic predators on the abundance of the lake chironomid Chironomus zealandicus, showed that if invertebrate predators were present in the lake they could markedly reduce the abundance of the pest prey species. This study highlights that the frequent re-suspension of bottom sediments, lake level fluctuation resulting in wetting and drying of littoral zones, and the management of the lake opening to the sea all have an effect on the benthic ecology of Te Waihora.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal</field><field name="subject">shallow lakes</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">Lake Ellesmere</field><field name="subject">benthic ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech, Phonological Awareness and Literacy in New Zealand Children with Down Syndrome</field><field name="creator">van Bysterveldt, Anne Katherine</field><field name="description">Children with Down syndrome (DS) are reported to experience difficulty with spoken and written language which can persist through the lifespan. However, little is known about the spoken and written language profiles of children with DS in the New Zealand social and education environment, and a thorough investigation of these profiles has yet to be conducted. The few controlled interventions to remediate language deficits in children with DS that are reported in the literature typically focus on remediation of a single language domain, with the effectiveness of interventions which integrate spoken and written language goals yet to be explored for this population. The experiments reported in this thesis aim to address these areas of need. The following questions are asked 1) What are the phonological awareness, speech, language and literacy skills of New Zealand children with DS? 2) What are the home and school literacy environments of New Zealand children with DS and how do they support written language development? and 3) What are the immediate and longer term effects of an integrated phonological awareness intervention on enhancing aspects of spoken and written language development in young children with DS? These questions will be addressed through the following chapters. The first experiment (presented in Chapter 2) was conducted in two parts. Part 1 consisted of the screening of the early developing phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and decoding skills of 77 primary school children with DS and revealed considerable variability between participants on all measures. Although some children were able to demonstrate mastery of the phoneme identity and letter knowledge skills, floor effects were also apparent. Data were analysed by age group (5 - 8 years and 9 -14 years) which revealed increased performance with maturation, with older children outperforming their younger peers on all measures. Approximately one quarter of all children were unable to decode any words, 6.6% demonstrated decoding skills at a level expected for 7 - 8 year old children and one child demonstrated decoding skills at an age equivalent level. Significant relationships between decoding skills and letter knowledge were found to exist. In Part 2 of the experiment, 27 children with DS who participated in the screening study took part in an in-depth investigation into their speech, phonological awareness, reading accuracy and comprehension and narrative language skills. Results of the speech assessments revealed the participants&#8217; speech was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the speech of younger children with typical development, but that elements of disorder were also evident. Results of the phonological awareness measures indicated participants were more successful with blending than with segmentation at both sentence and syllable level. Rhyme generation scores were particularly low. Reading accuracy scores were in advance of reading comprehension, with strong relationships demonstrated between reading accuracy and phonological awareness and letter knowledge. Those children who were better readers also had better language skills, producing longer sentences and using a greater number of different words in their narratives. The production of more advanced narrative structures was restricted to better readers. In the second experiment (presented in Chapter 3), the home literacy environment of 85 primary school aged children with DS was investigated. Parents of participants completed a questionnaire which explored the frequency and duration of literacy interactions, other ways parents support and facilitate literacy, parents&#8217; priorities for their children at school, and the child&#8217;s literacy skills. Results revealed that the homes of participants were generally rich in literacy resources, and that parents and children read together regularly, although many children were reported to take a passive role duding joint story reading. Many parents also reported actively teaching their child letter names and sounds and encouraging literacy development in other ways such as language games, computer use, television viewing and library access.  Writing at home was much less frequent than reading, and the allocation of written homework was much less common than reading homework. In the third experiment (presented in Chapter 4), the school literacy environment of 87 primary school aged children with DS (identified in the second experiment) was explored. In a parallel survey to the one described in Chapter 3, the teachers of participants completed a questionnaire which explored the frequency and duration of literacy interactions, the role of the child during literacy interactions, the child&#8217;s literacy skills, and other ways literacy is supported. The results of the questionnaire revealed nearly all children took part in regular reading instruction in the classroom although the amount of time reportedly dedicated to reading instruction was extremely variable amongst respondents. The average amount of time spent on reading instruction was consistent with that reported nationally and in advance of the international average for Year 5 children. Reading instruction was typically given in small groups or in a one on one setting and included both &#8216;top-down&#8217; and bottom up&#8217; strategies. Children were more likely to be assigned reading homework compared to written homework, with writing activities and instruction reported to be particularly challenging. In the fourth experiment (reported in Chapter 5), the effectiveness of an experimental integrated phonological awareness intervention was evaluated for ten children with DS, who ranged in age from 4;04 to 5;05 (M = 4;11, SD = 4.08 months). The study employed a multiple single-subject design to evaluate the effect of the intervention on participants&#8217; trained and untrained speech measures, and examined the development of letter knowledge and phonological awareness skills. The 18 week intervention included the following three components; 1. parent implemented print referencing during joint story reading, 2. speech goals integrated with letter knowledge and phoneme awareness activities conducted by the speech-language therapist (SLT) in a play based format, and 3. letter knowledge and phoneme awareness activities conducted by the computer specialist (CS) adapted for presentation on a computer. The intervention was implemented by the SLT and CS at an early intervention centre during two 20 minute sessions per week, in two 6 week therapy blocks separated by a 6 week break (i.e. 8 hours total). The parents implemented the print referencing component in four 10 minute sessions per week across the 18 week intervention period (approximately 12 hours total). Results of the intervention revealed all ten children made statistically significant gains on their trained and untrained speech targets with some children demonstrating transfer to other phonemes in the same sound class. Six children demonstrated gains in letter knowledge and nine children achieved higher scores on phonological awareness measures at post-intervention, however all phonological awareness scores were below chance. The findings demonstrated that dedicating some intervention time to facilitating the participants&#8217; letter knowledge and phonological awareness was not at the expense of speech gains. The fifth experiment (presented in Chapter 6) comprises a re-evaluation of the speech, phonological awareness, and letter knowledge, and an evaluation of the decoding and spelling development in children with DS who had previously participated in an integrated phonological awareness intervention (see Chapter 5), after they had subsequently received two terms (approximately 20 weeks) of formal schooling. Speech accuracy was higher at follow-up than at post-intervention on standardised speech measures and individual speech targets for the group as a whole, with eight of the ten participants demonstrating increased scores on their individual speech targets. Group scores on both letter knowledge measures were higher at follow-up than at post-intervention, with nine participants maintaining or improving on post-intervention performance. The majority of participants exhibited higher phonological awareness scores at follow-up on both the phoneme level assessments, with above chance scores achieved by five participants on one of the tasks, however, scores on the rhyme matching task demonstrated no evidence of growth. Some transfer of phonological awareness and letter knowledge was evident, with five children able to decode some words on the single word reading test and three children able to represent phonemes correctly in the experimental spelling task. The emergence of these early literacy skills highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring of children&#8217;s ability to transfer their improved phonological awareness and letter knowledge to decoding and spelling performance. In the sixth experiment (presented in Chapter 7) the long term effects of the integrated phonological awareness intervention was evaluated for one boy with DS aged 5;2 at the start of the intervention. The study monitored Ben&#8217;s speech and literacy development up to the age of 8;0 (34 months post pre-school intervention) which included two years of formal schooling. Ben demonstrated sustained growth on all measures with evidence of a growing ability to transfer letter-sound knowledge and phoneme-grapheme correspondences to the reading and spelling process. The results indicated an intervention which is provided early and which simultaneously targets speech, letter knowledge and phonological awareness goals provides a promising alternative to conventional therapy, and that integrating spoken and written therapy goals for children with DS can be effective in facilitating development in both domains. This thesis provides evidence that the spoken and written language abilities of New Zealand children with DS exhibit a pattern of delay and disorder that is largely consistent with those of children with DS from other countries reported in the literature. The home and school literacy environments of children in New Zealand with DS are rich in literacy resources and are, for the most part, supportive of their literacy development. The immediate and longer term results of the integrated phonological awareness intervention suggest that it is possible to achieve significant and sustained gains in speech, letter knowledge and phonological awareness which may contribute to the remediation of the persistent and compromised spoken and written language profile characteristic of individuals with DS.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">phonological awareness</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">Down syndrome</field><field name="subject">home literacy environment</field><field name="subject">school literacy environment</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volume Change of the Tasman Glacier Using Remote Sensing</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Joel Spencer</field><field name="description">Mountain glaciers are expected to be the greatest contributor to sea level rise over the next century. Glaciers provide a good indicator of global climate and how to monitor their change is an increasingly important issue for climate science and for sea level rise forecasts. However, there has been little direct measurement of glacier volume change in New Zealand.  This study explores the use of remotely sensed data for measuring glacier volume change from 1965 to 2006. Digital photogrammetric methods were used to extract topographic data of the Tasman Glacier from aerial photography and ASTER imagery for the years 1965, 1986, 2002 and 2006. SRTM C band data from 2000 were also analysed.  Data were compared to an existing digital elvation model produced from the New Zealand Digital Topographic Database to test for their reliability. Using regression analysis, the data were filtered and points representing rock were used to correct points on the glacier ice for vertical bias. The quality of the data extracted from the aerial photography was good on rock and debris covered ice, but poor on snow. The data extracted from ASTER was much more reliable on snow in the upper glacier than the aerial photography, but was very poor in the lower debris covered region of the glacier. While the quality of the SRTM data is very high, there is a second order distortion present in the data that is evident over elevation differences. However, the overall mean difference of the SRTM rock from TOPODATA is close to zero.  An overall trend could be seen in the data between dates. However, the 2006 ASTER data proved unreliable on the debris covered section of the glacier. Total volume change is therefore calculated for the period between 1965 and 2002. The data show a loss of 3:4km&#179; or 0:092km&#179; per year, an estimated 6% of the total ice in New Zealand. This is compared to estimates using the annual end of summer snowline survey between 1977 and 2005 of 1:78 km&#179;, or 0:064km&#179; per year.  The spatial resolution of ASTER makes high temporal resolution monitoring of volume change unlikely for the New Zealand glaciers. The infrequency of aerial photography, the high cost and vast time involved in extracting good quality elevation data from aerial photography makes it impractical for monitoring glacier volume change remotely. However, SRTM and other radar sensors may provide a better solution, as the data do not rely heavily on user processing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasman Glacier</field><field name="subject">Remote Sensing</field><field name="subject">ASTER</field><field name="subject">photogrammetry</field><field name="subject">volume change</field><field name="subject">Southern Alps</field><field name="subject">Digital Elevation Model</field><field name="subject">SRTM</field><field name="subject">DEM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between Time Management and Decision-Making Processes</field><field name="creator">Varlamova, Viktoriya</field><field name="description">During the last two decades, time management and decision-making have become well-established topics in modern working life. However, little research attention has been given to the link between the two. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between time management factors and decision-making processes. This research was specifically focused on identifying which aspects of decision-making processes are related to time management factors. It was predicted that decision-making processes will be more efficient\effective when employees have time management related competencies and work in an environment that supports time management. A research model was built based on previous research in this field and tested using bivariate correlations, t-tests, and multiple-regression analyses. Five organizations in New Zealand and three in Russia participated in the research, contributing a total of 164 employees. Results indicated, as predicted, that the effectiveness of decision-making processes partially depends on time management factors. Implications of the findings are discussed and future directions for research on the relationship between time management factors and decision-making processes are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Mathematical Aspects of Phylogenetic Estimation</field><field name="creator">Fischer, Mareike</field><field name="description">In evolutionary biology, genetic sequences carry with them a trace of the underlying tree that describes their evolution from a common ancestral sequence. Inferring this underlying tree is challenging. We investigate some curious cases in which different methods like Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and distance-based methods lead to different trees. Moreover, we state that in some cases, ancestral sequences can be more reliably reconstructed when some of the leaves of the tree are ignored - even if these leaves are close to the root. While all these findings show problems inherent to either the assumed model or the applied method, sometimes an inaccurate tree reconstruction is simply due to insufficient data. This is particularly problematic when a rapid divergence event occurred in the distant past. We analyze an idealized form of this problem and determine a tight lower bound on the growth rate for the sequence length required to resolve the tree (independent of any particular branch length). Finally, we investigate the problem of intermediates in the fossil record. The extent of &#8216;gaps&#8217; (missing transitional stages) has been used to argue against gradual evolution from a common ancestor. We take an analytical approach and demonstrate why, under certain sampling conditions, we may not expect intermediates to be found.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">maximum parsimony</field><field name="subject">maximum likelihood</field><field name="subject">fossils</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stream communities in acid mine drainages : investigating longitudinal recovery and remediation possibilities.</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Alice Jane</field><field name="description">The mechanisms of acid mine drainage were investigated in stream communities on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, with specific regard to the Denniston/Stockton areas. To do this, a field survey of AMD impacted streams indicated that some natural recovery occurred without anthropogenic management, particularly in Charming Creek and Darcy Stream, and to a lesser extent in the Waimangaroa River. This recovery is associated with improvements in water quality due to the dilution of AMD by non-impacted tributaries. Rapid Creek is a small, contaminated stream that was used as a model to assess the mechanisms of AMD toxicity. Iron precipitate on substrate altered water chemistry and proved toxic to Deleatidium mayflies. Substrate with iron precipitate harbours more organic biofilm, but in-situ experimentation did not detect a difference in the invertebrate community associated with either iron-precipitate coated substrate, or substrate without iron. Experimentation over 96-hours indicated that low pH (&lt;4) was the primary cause of toxicity, and that dissolved metals were secondarily toxic. Techniques to rectify these causes of toxicity were investigated. Dilution with distilled water, and the commercial cation-exchange products Bauxsol&#8482; and Zeolite were used to treat AMD water, and the survival of Deleatidium subsequently exposed to this water was compared. Bauxsol&#8482; and Zeolite improved mayfly survival after 96 hours by 50%. Dilution, up to 8-fold did not improve mayfly survival. Extrapolation indicated that dilution up to 64-fold would be required to mitigate the effects of acidic AMD entering Rapid Creek, even though the natural levels of pH are generally &lt;5. The combined results of this study suggest that active remediation of AMD impacted streams would facilitate an improvement in the condition of the ecosystems, provided specific regard is given to the particular circumstances of each stream.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods in Percolation</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael James</field><field name="description">Algorithms are presented for the computationally efficient manipulation of graphs. These are subsequently used as the basis of a Monte Carlo method for sampling from the microcanonical ensemble of lattice configurations of a percolation model within a neighbourhood of the critical point.  This new method arbitrarily increments and decrements the number of occupied lattice sites, and is shown to be a generalisation of several earlier, purely incremental, methods. As demonstrations of capability, the method was used to construct a phase diagram for exciton transport on a disordered surface, and to study finite size effects upon the incipient spanning cluster.  Application of the method to the classical site percolation model on the two-dimensional square lattice resulted in an exceptionally precise estimate of the critical threshold. Although this estimate is not in agreement with earlier results, its accuracy was established through an application specific test of randomness, which is also introduced here. The same test suggests that many earlier results have been systematically biased due to the use of deficient pseudorandom number generators.

Caffeine has been shown to affect the later behaviour of rats and mice when exposed to the drug daily before birth and during the lactational period of development. However, to date, little research has investigated the effects caffeine consumption may have on adolescent brain development, and the behavioural consequences of this.  The present study, therefore, investigated the effects of repeated caffeine exposure on adolescent rats on behavioural measures of anxiety. During middle and later adulthood, the rats&#8217; activity and emotional reactivity were assessed by means of frequencies of rearing, ambulation, immobility, defaecation and urination recorded in an open field, as well as their occupancy of corners and centre squares of the field, and their partial emergence and latencies to fully emerge from a small darkened chamber into a brightly lit arena. The results showed that those rats treated with caffeine were probably more emotionally reactive than untreated controls, as suggested by more immobility, defaecation and urination. There were also effects on rearing and ambulation that might have arisen from increased impulsivity. Overall, the results suggest that exposure to caffeine during adolescence produces some small but significant increases in emotionality in adulthood. This study may have clinical implications, as it is possible that people exposed to caffeine as adolescents, may show increased anxiety later in life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">caffeine</field><field name="subject">drug</field><field name="subject">anxiety</field><field name="subject">emotionality</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of season and salinity acclimation on survival, permeability and osmoregulation of Hemigrapsus crenulatus : (Crustacea: Grapsidae).</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Graeme</field><field name="description">Various aspects of the ecophysiology of the estuarine mud crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus (Milne Edwards, 1837) have been studied. Field studies have shown that the population of crabs in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary experience a seasonal variation in salinity and temperature, such that the environment is more dilute and colder during the winter than in the summer. Experiments using crabs direct from the field showed that these animals undergo a seasonal acclimatization which results in winter crabs having a greater tolerance to dilute (1%) sea water than summer crabs. This change in salinity tolerance is accompanied by winter animals having a slower rate of sodium loss, a lower apparent water permeability and a 'stronger' regulation of blood osmotic pressure in 100% sea water, than summer collected animals. Laboratory studies showed that, compared with crabs acclimated to full strength sea water, animals acclimated (for 5 weeks) to low salinities were more tolerant of 1% sea water, had a slower sodium loss rate and an osmoregulation curve that was shifted towards the isosmotic line. However, no long-term effect of salinity acclimation on apparent water permeability was found. It is suggested that salinity does playa role in the seasonal acclimatization, but some other factor(s) also appears to be involved.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of growth and reproduction of the hairy handed crab, Hemigrapsus crenulatus (Brachyura : Grapsidae).</field><field name="creator">Clark, Rachel Louise</field><field name="description">Aspects of the growth and reproductive biology of the grapsid brachyuran Hemiqrapsus crenulatus (H. Milne Edwards 1837) have been studied in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary (43&#176; 33'S, 172&#176; 44'E), Christchurch, New Zealand. Relative growth analysis revealed that males became mature between 13.0 and 15.0mm CW whilst females achieved maturity between 9.0 and 11.0mm CW which coincided with the size of the smallest ovigerous females found in the field. Differences in the allometric growth of secondary sexual characters were also apparent. Monthly size frequency distributions over a two year sampling period revealed that the population consisted mainly of crabs in the middle size classes (12.0mm to 20.0mm CW) which maintained a 1:1 sex ratio however, males dominated all other size classes. The breeding season, based on the occurrence of ovigerous females, spanned 8-9 months from June to January/February. This extended breeding season could be attributed to some females producing successive broods with or without an intervening moult. Females were capable of transmoult sperm retention and ovarian and embryological development was cyclic. Laboratory studies indicated that a minimum incubation time of 45 days was required although lower salinities increased incubation period and egg size. Attempts at rearing H.crenulatus zoeae in various combinations of temperature and salinity were unsuccessful due to their apparent inability to feed. Absolute growth analysis indicated that males have larger growth increments and reached maturity in a year in their 11th instar, whereas females became mature in their 9th instar after only 290 days. A seasonal incidence of moulting was apparent with observed peaks occurring before and after the breeding season.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding ecology of the New Zealand Cancer crab Cancer novaezelandiae (Jacquinot, 1853) (Brachyura: Cancridae).</field><field name="creator">Creswell, Paul D.</field><field name="description">This study investigates the predatory behaviour of Cancer novaezelandiae (Decapoda : Brachyura : Cancridae), a subtidal crab from Lyttelton Harbour, Banks Peninsula. Cancer crabs were obtained at bimonthly intervals over a 22 month sampling period. Examination of stomach contents suggested that C.novaezelandiae was an opportunistic predator feeding on a wide variety of food items. Molluscs composed the major components of diet, with bivalves and gastropods comprising 35 % of all food items. Crustacea were the next most important group comprising 20 % of all food items. Amphipods, isopods and crabs were the most frequent crustaceans found. Other food types included fish, sponges, coelenterates and plant matter in relatively low abundances. No variation in dietary composition was evident with crab sex, size or season. The functional morphology of the chelae, mouthparts and gastric mill were examined for two size-classes of crab (60.0-70.0 and 120.0-130.0 mm carapace width). The mouthparts and gastric mill were generalised in structure and were typical of large, predatory brachyurans. Large crista dentata of the third maxilliped and sharp, rounded mandibles, together with large, heavily chitinised gastric mill ossicles suggested that C.novaezelandiae was well equipped to macerate course, particulate matter. No variation in either mouthparts and gastric mill structure was evident with crab size or sex. Left and right chela of C.novaezelandiae were morphologically similar in shape and dental pattern, and no difference was found between sexes. Relative growth of the chelae was described from measurements made on propodus height and length using carapace width as the reference dimension. Log-transformed regressions were used to test for allometric growth and lines were compared using t-tests. No significant difference was found in the growth of the propodus between left and right chelipeds, and for males and females. Relative growth of the propodus was positively allometric which remained constant throughout crab growth. No discontinuity in growth of the propodus was evident for male and female crabs (however for male crabs over 110 mm carapace width there was a slight indication of increased propodus growth). Both left and right chela of male and female crabs had a large diastema, and mean mechanical advantage of 0.367 and 0.375 respectively. The high mechanical advantage of the chela in C.novaezelandiae appeared to remain constant throughout crab growth, allowing a compressive force in excess of 496 kN.m&#8315;&#178;. The polyfunctional chela are therefore, capable of holding, manipulating and crushing a variety of prey shapes. Predator-prey experiments were undertaken in the laboratory using male crabs of three size classes (55.0-65.0, 80.0-90.0 and 105.0-115.0 mm carapace width). Prey used included blue mussel Mvtilus edulis aoteanus, cockle Chione stutchburyi, spotted whelk Cominella maculosa and catseye Turbo smaragdus. C.novaezelandiae adopted five distinct techniques to open bivalve and three techniques to open gastropod shells. The particular opening technique used was influenced by crab size, prey size and success of previous attempts. Small molluscs were usually opened by direct crushing by the chela and/or mouthparts. Splitting of the umbone valves and removal of the aperture lip were the most successful techniques used to open large bivalves and gastropods respectively. Handling times increased exponentially with prey size, with large crabs requiring less time to open prey than small crabs. Prey species influenced handling times with bivalves opened more quickly than gastropods. Critical maximum prey size increased with crab size, while minimum critical size was smaller for small crabs. Different sized crabs consumed similar numbers of prey, but energy intake increased with crab size. Profitability curves were derived and tested with regard to optimal prey size and species. When presented with a size range, crabs selected prey sizes that minimized time spent foraging. However when presented with different prey species, crabs maximized energy intake by selecting optimum prey species. Findings suggested C.novaezelandiae exhibited a flexible foraging behaviour, which allows crabs to maximize feeding efficiency.

Temperature,food supplies and retention times were major factors influencing seasonal cycles in the most upstream reservoir, Lake Benmore, while populations in the two downstream reservoirs were also strongly influenced by discharges of plankton from Lake Benmore. vertical distributions of zooplankton species in the three reservoirs were investigated by sampling with a Van Darn water bottle. Adults, nauplii and copepodites of the copepod Boeckella dilatata generally showed some spatial separation during the day and B. dilatata, the cladoceran, Bosmina meridionalis, and the rotifer, Asplanchna priodonta, migrated to the surface at night. A more detailed investigation was made of the population dynamics of Boeckella dilatata. Throughout 18 months of sampling, no clear temporal sequences of developmental stages were identified in discharges from Lake Waitaki. However, there were clear indications that population structure in Lake Waitaki was affected by discharges of B. dilatata from Lake Benmore. Egg development rates of B. dilatata were investigated in the laboratory and were used to calculate the finite birth rate (B) for the days of sampling. Daily production was estimated from standing crop biomass and turnover times (calculated as 1/B). Mean clutch sizes and finite per capita birth rates of B. dilatata in the two arms of Lake Benmore were markedly higher than values recorded for populations of calanoid copepods (including B. dilatata) in other New Zealand lakes. The feeding behaviour of B. dilatata was investigated by exposing the animals to a suspension of micronic plastic beads. The maximum bead size ingested by B. dilatata copepodites increased in the later instars and the largest bead ingested by adult females was approximately 40 &#956;m.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of computer vision algorithms using J2ME for mobile phone applications.</field><field name="creator">Gu, Jian</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research on the use of Java to develop cross-platform computer vision applications for mobile phones with integrated cameras.

It follows some of these students into their first year out of school into tertiary education or otherwise. Two surveys were conducted that employed the Attitude to Debt Scale (Davies and Lea, 1995) to address students&#8217; debt and savings behaviour and estimates, tertiary education entry decisions, and attitudes to tertiary education and term-time working. Debt attitudes are found to be more complex than previously proposed, and this has significant ramifications for debt attitude theory and research. Longitudinal comparisons suggest students&#8217; views regarding debt necessity does not change but their attitude to avoiding does. Students become more or less avoidant of debt depending on their circumstances. However, debt attitude results still support many of the findings of earlier research such as debt acquisition preceding a more tolerant attitude change. Debt and tertiary education attitudes are not well predicted. Students report engaging in term-time working to limit their student loans, but engaging in term-time working results in lower grades in their studies. Those from the middle and higher socio-economic classes are more likely to be positive towards tertiary education, and thus entrants, compared with the lower socio-economic classes. However, the results do not suggest this is due to debt attitudes or fear of debt.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary entry</field><field name="subject">student debt</field><field name="subject">term-time working</field><field name="subject">socio-economic class</field><field name="subject">tertiary entry</field><field name="subject">attitudes to debt</field><field name="subject">student loans</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and biology of the marine invasive bivalve Theora lubrica (Semelidae).</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Olivia Ruth</field><field name="description">This study examined aspects of the biology and distribution of the marine invasive bivalve Theora lubrica in the Lyttelton Basin from two distinct sampling areas. Samples were collected monthly, over a 13 month period (January 2004 and January 2005), with particular emphasis on seasonal sedimentary characteristics and contamination. The sample sites consisted of five Port sites and five Harbour sites. They were sampled using a 20 litre anchor dredge. In winter and summer, core samples from each of the sample sites were collected, and the top 1.5cm of sediment was used to obtain sediment characteristics. Sediment characteristics indicated a depositional setting, with an average grain size (diameter) of 8-10 &#956;m, which did not vary seasonally. Analysis indicated that the sediments naturally flocculated, to the 100&#956;m size range and were platykurtic. Organic content (OC) in the sediment in Lyttelton Port showed significant seasonal variation. OC was highest during the winter period corresponding to an increase of T. lubrica abundance. There were noticeable seasonal changes in the abundance of T. lubrica, with high winter and low summer population densities. The period for recruitment coincided with high T. lubrica densities, and the greater frequency of juveniles with shell length below 4.33 mm. Histological sections showed that spawning occurred during the summer, confirmed by the presence of high percentages of ovigerous females and mature males. Community analyses distinguished four distinct seasonal and spatial benthic populations. The populations exhibited greater total species richness during the summer (compared to the winter). T. lubrica, maintained high abundance during periods of low total species richness. Furthermore, there was evidence of a predator prey relationship between the crab Macrophthalmus hirtipes and T. lubrica. Trace metals and hydrocarbons showed seasonal and spatial variation between the Port and Harbour sediments. Only the arsenic, nickel and copper in the Port location were at concentrations likely to be toxic to the biota. No trace metals exceeded threshold limits in the Harbour. Levels of arsenic and nickel were highest in the summer and copper was at its highest concentration in the winter. However, there was little evidence to suggest that the sediment contamination affects T. lubrica or the rest of the benthic community directly. Thus, the significantly lower species richness at the Port location may be due to other influences (i.e. sediment disturbance from shipping). In conclusion T lubrica is regarded as an opportunistic marine invasive species which can inhabit areas not occupied by other marine macro-biota. T lubrica did not appear to negatively impact the other benthic species at the Lyttelton Port or Harbour sites. It provided a plentiful food source and increased species diversity in sediments that are frequently disturbed (by shipping and wave action). Furthermore, T lubrica may help reestablish native species to the Port area by filtering and processing contaminated sediments (bioturbation), potentially pioneering the way for greater species diversity in Lyttelton Port and Harbour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the genetic and physiological basis of Triticum sphaerococcum Perc.</field><field name="creator">Josekutty, Puthiyaparambil Chacko</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Triticum sphaerococcum (AABBDD, 2n = 6x = 42) is a land race of wheat known from the Indian subcontinent. It has several favourable characters including short and strong culms, hemispherical grains with a shallow crease (that may increase the yield of white flour), higher protein content compared to bread wheat (T. aestivum), and resistance to drought, and yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis. However, an unfavourable characteristic of T. sphaerococcum is its lower yield compared to bread wheat. Being a land race, the sphaerococcum wheat is poorly studied. This study was undertaken to increase knowledge of the physiology and genetics of this land race and determine if it may be possible to separate the favourable characters of T. sphaerococcum from its unfavourable characters. Plant height in bread wheat is controlled by many genes. &#8216;Reduced Height&#8217; (Rht) genes which differ in their response to externally applied gibberellic acid (GA3) are responsible for the short stature of modern bread wheat varieties. Therefore, GA3 was used to probe the relationship between the semidwarf sphaerococcum phenotype and the Rht gene. T. sphaerococcum variety Sp5 showed a unique &#8220;seedling response&#8221; to externally applied GA3 when compared with T. aestivum varieties harbouring Rht1, Rht2, Rht8, Rht12, Rht13 or Rht18 alleles. A mapping population of doubled haploids was generated through wide hybridisation of F1 (Sp5 x Otane) with Zea mays. A genome-wide scan of Sp5 and Otane (parents) using 348 microsatellite (SSR) markers showed that only 169 of these markers (49%) were polymorphic between the parents. A DArT profiling yielded 348 markers that were polymorphic between the parents. Microsatellite markers and DArT markers were used to create a genetic map. The mapping population was phenotyped and a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed for component traits of the complex sphaerococcum trait including plant height, spike length, awn length, yield, grain shape and crease size. Results of the QTL analysis indicated that it may be difficult to separate the favourable characters of T. sphaerococcum from its unfavourable characters through mutation because the component traits of the complex sphaerococcum trait may be under pleiotropic control of the Sp gene.  The hypothesis that T. sphaerococcum originated through a mutation in T. aestivum was tested through induced mutation using gamma rays. Mutants from sphaerococcum-type to aestivum-type were isolated and phenotyped. Sphaerococcum-type mutants also were isolated and characterised from mutated aestivum-type wheat suggesting a possible origin of T. sphaerococcum through a mutation in T. aestivum.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Triticum sphaerococcum</field><field name="subject">sphaerococcum wheat</field><field name="subject">round grain</field><field name="subject">reduced crease</field><field name="subject">DArT marker</field><field name="subject">mitotic index</field><field name="subject">SSR marker</field><field name="subject">genetic map</field><field name="subject">Rht gene</field><field name="subject">wheat evolution</field><field name="subject">wheat domestication</field><field name="subject">mutation breeding</field><field name="subject">doubled haploid</field><field name="subject">wheat physiology</field><field name="subject">wheat genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of THP-1 cells to oxidative damage induced by AAPH.</field><field name="creator">Kappler, Marion</field><field name="description">Monocyte cells can be damaged when exposed to reactive oxidative species during inflammatory events within the body. This research project has examined in detail the cellular events associated with free radical damage induced death of monocyte cells, using the water soluble peroxyl radical generator 2, 2' -azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) as a model of inflammation induced oxidative stress. The human monocyte-derived cell line THP-1 was incubated with 10mM AAPH in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution at 37&#176;C for up to 24 hours. Protein hydroperoxide formation was observed to occur after a six hour lag, period which corresponded to the time in which most of the intracellular glutathione was lost from the cell. Cell viability loss, measured by the MTT reduction, was also observed after six hours of incubation while no caspase-3 activation was observed. A control ethanol treatment confirmed that caspase-3 could be activated within the THP-1 cells. Flow cytometry analysis failed to show phosphatidylserine exposure due to the AAPH treatment but DNA staining by propidium iodide confirmed the loss of viability seen with the MTT cell viability assay. This data strongly suggests that THP-1 cells undergo AAPH induced necrosis as a result of cellular damage including GSH loss and protein hydroperoxide formation. Microscopic examination of the cells identified many of the morphological characteristics of necrosis in the AAPH treated cells. Studies on the effect of AAPH on U937 cells were unsuccessful due to the possible presence of intracellular infection, resulting in an increased oxidant stress in the untreated cells.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing patterns of flour-milling in the South Island, 1840-1973.</field><field name="creator">Wright, Murray John</field><field name="description">Soon after the first permanent colonists came to the South Island the first flour-mills were established to produce flour for the needs of the population. Since that day technological progress has brought changes in the location of mills. The development of milling is outlined in this thesis together with the impact that new inventions have had on the pattern of mill locations in various time periods. Factors other than inventions are also discussed. These include the regulation of the industry by millers themselves, and, more recently the impact that government control has had on the pattern of mills. Through an historical study it is possible to see how the contemporary pattern evolved. A base is created by this work from which future researchers can gain an insight into the factors that have affected mill locations in the past and which must be borne in mind when predicting future trends.

Problems affecting this type of research pertain to matters such as definition, measurement, and a lack of unifying theory. A grounded theory investigation was used to attempt to generate a theory with substantive and predictive value. Thirty-five participants were interviewed and questioned about their ER patterns. Analysis of this data showed that the motivations individuals have form a broad unifying construct through which to look at ER. As such, a theory is posited which looks at ER in terms of twin motivations - one primarily present for the self, and the other primarily occurring for social reasons. Such an approach is new to the field of ER. The theory is evaluated in terms of current research and future research directions. Overall, the presented theory is found to be able to unify current research on ER, as well as having the potential to push research efforts in new, more meaningful directions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alexithymia and attachment in eating disorders.</field><field name="creator">Selway, Susan Lynne</field><field name="description">A multi-dimensional construct, alexithymia represents a cluster of characteristics: difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal, difficulty describing feelings, an externally-oriented cognitive style, constricted imaginal processes and paucity of fantasy. Originally developed to describe features observed in psychosomatic patients, it is now thought that alexithymia makes individuals vulnerable to physical and mental illness, including coronary heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders, somatoform disorders, and eating disorders. Alexithymia is thought to reflect dissociation or dysfunction in the emotion regulation system resulting from an arrest in emotion development at the preoperational stage. This study investigated the hypothesis that the origins of alexithymia (i.e. disrupted emotion development) lie in problematic attachment relations. A group of women diagnosed with eating disorders (N = 30) and a comparison group of women of similar age (N = 83) were administered a set of self-report instruments that included the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), Close Relationships Questionnaire (CRQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2). With the exception of the externally oriented thinking subscale of the TAS-20, eating disorders group means were significantly higher than comparison group means for subscales of all measures (p &lt; .05). The eating disorders group was more alexithymic, more severely depressed and anxious, and showed patterns of less secure attachment than the comparison group. Alexithymia was shown to to vary with education. Anxiety, trait anxiety in particular, and depression could account for elevated alexithymia scores in the eating disorders group. In the whole sample, correlations were revealed between the PBI and CRQ suggesting continuity of attachment, and both attachment measures could predict TAS-20 subscales providing support for the hypothesis implicating attachment in the etiology of alexithymia. All measures predicted EDI-2 subscales, with the most diverse relationships revealed for BDI-2 and TAS-20. An unexpected positive relationship was revealed between PBI paternal care and two of the TAS-20 subscales, difficulty describing feelings and externally oriented thinking. A number of possible explanations are discussed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reversible Photoregulation of Binding of the Serine Protease &#945;-Chymotrypsin to a Functional Surface</field><field name="creator">Pearson, David Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the first example of reversible photoregulation of the binding of a protease, &#945;-chymotrypsin, to a surface. A modular approach is used involving the azobenzene photoswitch group, a surface linker and an enzyme binding group. This approach is designed to be easily extended to the photoregulation of binding of other proteases to surfaces by use of enzyme binding groups selective to these proteases. Chapter one gives a brief outline of some of the important areas involved in to this work, including molecular switches, proteases and surface modification. Chapter two describes the synthesis of azobenzene-containing boronate esters designed as photoswitch inhibitors of &#945;-chymotrypsin. Boronate esters were prepared containing the aminophenylboronate group or the peptidomimetic borophenylalanine group for enzyme binding and a range of substituents designed for enzyme affinity and/or surface attachment. Syntheses primarily involved peptide coupling reactions and azobenzene formation by condensation of nitrosobenzenes and anilines. Coupling reactions were successfully carried out using EDCI or isobutyl chlorofomate in several cases where other reagents gave unacceptable decomposition. Chapter three describes the syntheses and HPLC stability studies of derivatives of a noncovalent &#945;-chymotrypsin inhibitor. Several dipeptide-based compounds containing either an amide group for surface attachment or an azobenzene group for photoswitching were prepared, primarily using peptide coupling reactions. Each compound was incubated with &#945;-chymotrypsin to assess its stability, and all were found by HPLC monitoring to be stable to &#945;-chymotrypsin catalysed hydrolysis. Chapter four describes syntheses of azobenzene-containing trifluoromethylketones and &#945;-ketoesters designed as photoswitch inhibitors of &#945;-chymotrypsin. Trifluoromethylketones/&#945;-ketoesters containing amine groups for surface attachment were prepared, primarily using peptide coupling reactions, but could not be isolated due to the incompatibility of the electrophilic ketone and primary amine groups. Trifluoromethylketones/&#945;-ketoesters containing terminal alkynes for surface attachment were prepared either by the attachment of an alkyne substituent group to a symmetrical azobenzene core or by Pd-catalysed reaction of a protected alkyne with an azobenzene having a halide substitutent. Chapter five describes syntheses of sulfur-containing surface linkers for use in surface attachment of the photoswitch inhibitors described in chapters 2-4. A range of compounds containing disulfide or protected thiol groups for surface attachment and azide or carboxylic acid groups for inhibitor attachment were prepared. Syntheses primarily involved coupling of functionalised alcohols/amides to carboxylic acid-containing disulfides/thioacetates. Selected linkers were attached to azobenzenes by amide coupling or azide-alkyne cycloaddition for surface attachment, photoswitching and/or enzyme assay. Azide-alkyne cycloaddition yields were initially poor, but were improved by use of stoichiometric amounts of copper catalyst. Chapter six describes UV/vis photoisomerisation studies and enzyme assays carried out to assess enzyme photoswitching of the compounds described in chapters 2-5. The trifluoromethylketones and &#945;-ketoesters described in chapter 4 gave the best results, with moderate inhibition of &#945;-chymotrypsin (&#181;M affinity constants) and up to 5.3 fold changes in inhibition on UV/vis irradiation. Many of the boronate esters described in chapter 2 were found to inhibit &#945;-chymotrypsin, but were somewhat unstable to irradiation. The dipeptide-based compounds described in chapter 3 were inactive against &#945;-chymotrypsin. Good photoisomerisation was obtained for an azobenzene containing a symmetrical disulfide surface linker and poor photoisomerisation was obtained for an azobenzene containing a lipoic acid surface linker. Chapter seven describes surface attachment of selected photoswitch inhibitors and studies of photoregulated enzyme binding to the resultant functional surfaces. Self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of disulfides were formed on gold surfaces and characterised by electrochemistry and contact angle measurements. Binding of &#945;-chymotrypsin to SAMs containing a photoswitch inhibitor was detected by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), but was found to be largely irreversible. An alkyne-containing photoswitch inhibitor was attached to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip in a two step procedure involving generation of an azide modified surface followed by azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Binding of &#945;-chymotrypsin to the resultant modified surface was detected by SPR and successfully regulated by UV/vis irradiation.

I determined kereru disperser effectiveness by modelling seed dispersal distances (using seed retention times and movement patterns). Mean seed retention time was significantly longer for larger-seeded species, ranging from 37-181 minutes. Wild radiotracked kereru were sedentary, remaining at one location for up to 5.25 hours. The mean flight distance was 77 m and the maximum was 1, 457 m. Estimated mean seed dispersal distances for tawa (Beilschmiedia tawa), puriri (Vitex lucens), and fivefinger (Pseudopanax arboreus) were 95, 98, and 61 m respectively. Kereru dispersed 66-87% of ingested seeds away from the parent tree, with 79-88% of seeds dispersed &lt;100 m and &lt; 1% dispersed over 1,000 m. In a field seed-fate experiment, "pre-human" conditions (cleaned seeds, low density, away from parent, and protected from mammals) increased survival compared to "post-human" conditions (whole fruits, high density, under parent, not protected) for both taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi; 15% vs. 2% survival to one year respectively) and karaka (Corynocarpus laevigatus; 60% vs. 11% to two years, respectively). Fruit diameter varied considerably within karaka, taraire, and tawa, although theoretically not enough for them to be swallowed by other birds. Nevertheless, other birds are reported to occasionally take fruits of nearly all large-seeded species. Small tawa seeds produced smaller seedlings in the glasshouse; therefore selection of only smaller seeds by alternative dispersers may negatively affect tawa recruitment. Kereru are generally not gape-limited, and fruit size preferences were independent of mean fruit size. Kereru provide effective dispersal by moving most seeds away from the parent, and enhancing seed and seedling survival. Therefore, both dispersal failure and introduced mammals negatively affect the regeneration of large-seeded trees in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kereru</field><field name="subject">Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae</field><field name="subject">NZ pigeon</field><field name="subject">large seeds</field><field name="subject">dispersal failure</field><field name="subject">frugivory</field><field name="subject">seed shadow</field><field name="subject">taraire</field><field name="subject">Beilschmiedia tarairi</field><field name="subject">karaka</field><field name="subject">Corynocarpus laevigatus</field><field name="subject">tawa</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ngai Tahu development.</field><field name="creator">Swindells, James Wiremu</field><field name="description">Marxian mode of production analysis is a way of examining the composition of a society. Using this methodology an analysis of Maori society focussing on the Ngai Tahu tribe has demonstrated inconsistencies in the model but also provided a coherent structure for historical analysis of European-Maori relations. The direct relationship of the ideological structure with the forces of production was found to be a feature of the pre-capitalist mode of production (PCMP). This represents a departure from the ideal model. It was also found that the relationship between capitalism and the pre-capitalist mode has varied through five distinct periods. The spatial economy of Ngai Tahu has changed accordingly. The precapitalist ideological structure endured assimilation and has been crucial in leading modem Maori development. Consequentially the contemporary articulation of the PCMP and the capitalist mode of production has led to the development of an emerging mode of production Communal Capitalism. This mode is characterised by local development articulated with pre-capitalist relations and represents a spatial expansion of the Ngai Tahu economy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From prison into the community : the impact of release planning on sexual recidivism for child molesters.</field><field name="creator">Willis, Gwenda Miriam</field><field name="description">Research on the factors underlying sex offender recidivism has not considered the importance of the reintegration process through which the offender rejoins the community after prison.  This thesis reports findings from 3 empirical studies designed to explore whether poor release planning might contribute to sex offender recidivism.  In Study 1, a coding protocol was developed to measure the comprehensiveness of release planning for child molesters, which included items relating to accommodation, employment, pro-social support, community-based treatment, and Good Lives Model (T. Ward &amp; C.A. Stewart, 2003) secondary goods.  The protocol was retrospectively applied to groups of recidivist and nonrecidivist graduates of a prison-based treatment programme, who were matched on static risk level and time since release.  As predicted, overall release planning was significantly poorer for recidivists compared to nonrecidivists.  Study 2 was a validation and extension of Study 1.  The original coding protocol, and some revised items, were applied to matched groups of recidivists and nonrecidivists from a different treatment programme.  Consistent with Study 1 findings, overall release planning was significantly poorer for recidivists.  Data from Studies 1 and 2 were pooled (total N = 141) and Cox regressions showed that accommodation, employment, and social support planning combined to best predict recidivism, with predictive accuracy comparable to that obtained using static risk models.  Study 3 investigated whether release planning was associated with actual reintegration experiences, and additionally explored released child molesters&#8217; good lives plans.  Release plans were rated for 16 child molesters, who were interviewed post-release about their reintegration experiences and good lives plans.  As predicted, significant positive correlations were found between release planning and reintegration experiences 1 and 3 months following prison release, and results suggested that effective reintegration might help facilitate living a good life.  Overall, results from the 3 studies suggest that poor release planning and subsequent reintegration experiences contribute to sex offender recidivism.

This study assumes that without an understanding of terms used in the Treaty, attempts at its implementation face misunderstanding and confusion. Thus, the study begins by defining "rangatiratanga" as guaranteed in the Maori text of the Treaty. It proposes that rangatiratanga, within the framework of Maori tradition, is a process through which leadership is defined and decisions made. Fundamental to this process is a view of the world which recognises the interrelatedness} of all elements in nature. Findings from a study of Lake Ellesmere/Te Waihora and Ngai Tahu rangatiratanga suggest that Ngai Tahu face the task of reassessing their tribal structure after many years of European domination. Guarantees given in the Treaty suggest that the 'Government should actively support Ngai Tahu in this process but that the imposition of a uniform "tribal model" is inappropriate. In addition, if rangatiratanga is to be expressed in the context of Lake Ellesmere/Te Waihora, the interlocking nature of resource use within the lake's catchment points to the need for a partnership between all agencies involved in its management.- This can only occur where there is a convergence in attitude to environmental management on the part of both "partners".</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disaster management and response: a lifelines study for the Queenstown Lakes District</field><field name="creator">Keith, Hamish D.</field><field name="description">The Queenstown Lakes District is vulnerable to a number of natural hazards.

Many of the hazards that threaten the district have the potential to cause loss of life or injury and all of them have the potential to cause severe damage to homes, businesses and other infrastructure. Infrastructure and services that support life and business in the community, and that are used everyday are known as lifelines. Lifelines are generally taken for granted but are directly associated with the quality of life that we live. Lifelines include electricity, telecommunication, water supply, wastewater removal, transportation and emergency services. Following a major disaster the need for safe, effective and timely restoration of these lifeline systems is critical. This project analyses the vulnerability of lifelines with respect to natural hazards with the aim that it can be used to ensure that when a disaster occurs appropriate and efficient action is taken to minimise the impact. This thesis also attempts to raise awareness and understanding of the hazards that threaten the Queenstown Lakes District as well as emphasise the importance of lifelines and what's involved in their management. This will hopefully help readers understand the likely impacts of a disaster so that when one occurs they will not be completely caught unaware. This thesis will also hopefully entice the reader to better prepare for a disaster. Scenarios of each hazard were created based upon current scientific understanding and are used to illustrate more clearly the priorities that need to be addressed during the response and recovery phases of a disaster.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exact Markov chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian linear regression</field><field name="creator">Bentley, Jason Phillip</field><field name="description">In this work we investigate the use of perfect sampling methods within the context of Bayesian linear regression. We focus on inference problems related to the marginal posterior model probabilities. Model averaged inference for the response and Bayesian variable selection are considered. Perfect sampling is an alternate form of Markov chain Monte Carlo that generates exact sample points from the posterior of interest. This approach removes the need for burn-in assessment faced by traditional MCMC methods. For model averaged inference, we find the monotone Gibbs coupling from the past (CFTP) algorithm is the preferred choice. This requires the predictor matrix be orthogonal, preventing variable selection, but allowing model averaging for prediction of the response. Exploring choices of priors for the parameters in the Bayesian linear model, we investigate sufficiency for monotonicity assuming Gaussian errors. We discover that a number of other sufficient conditions exist, besides an orthogonal predictor matrix, for the construction of a monotone Gibbs Markov chain. Requiring an orthogonal predictor matrix, we investigate new methods of orthogonalizing the original predictor matrix. We find that a new method using the modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure performs comparably with existing transformation methods, such as generalized principal components. Accounting for the effect of using an orthogonal predictor matrix, we discover that inference using model averaging for in-sample prediction of the response is comparable between the original and orthogonal predictor matrix. The Gibbs sampler is then investigated for sampling when using the original predictor matrix and the orthogonal predictor matrix. We find that a hybrid method, using a standard Gibbs sampler on the orthogonal space in conjunction with the monotone CFTP Gibbs sampler, provides the fastest computation and convergence to the posterior distribution. We conclude the hybrid approach should be used when the monotone Gibbs CFTP sampler becomes impractical, due to large backwards coupling times. We demonstrate large backwards coupling times occur when the sample size is close to the number of predictors, or when hyper-parameter choices increase model competition. The monotone Gibbs CFTP sampler should be taken advantage of when the backwards coupling time is small. For the problem of variable selection we turn to the exact version of the independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) algorithm. We reiterate the notion that the exact IMH sampler is redundant, being a needlessly complicated rejection sampler. We then determine a rejection sampler is feasible for variable selection when the sample size is close to the number of predictors and using Zellner&#8217;s prior with a small value for the hyper-parameter c. Finally, we use the example of simulating from the posterior of c conditional on a model to demonstrate how the use of an exact IMH view-point clarifies how the rejection sampler can be adapted to improve efficiency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perfect sampling</field><field name="subject">Bayesian variable selection</field><field name="subject">linear regression</field><field name="subject">exact markov chain monte carlo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective Data Replication for Distributed Geographical Data Sets</field><field name="creator">Gu, Xuan</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this research is to incorporate additional higher-level semantics into the existing data replication strategies in such a way that their flexibility and performance can be improved in favour of both data providers and consumers. The resulting approach from this research is referred to as the selective data replication system. With this system, the data that has been updated by a data provider is captured and batched into messages known as update notifications. Once update notifications are received by data consumers, they are used to evaluate so-called update policies, which are specified by data consumers containing details on when data replications need to occur and what data needs to be updated during the replications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data replication</field><field name="subject">distributed database</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">geographical information system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disrupting discourses and (re)formulating identities : the politics of single motherhood in post-revolutionary Nicaragua</field><field name="creator">Cupples, Julie</field><field name="description">There is a clear relationship between motherhood and space in the sense that motherhood is constituted spatially, taking specific and shifting forms in different spaces and because gendered geographies are made, remade or contested in terms of how women practise motherhood and other social identities in particular spaces. The meanings of motherhood are subject to constant renegotiation when gender identity is lived and constructed in times of hardship, political change or upheaval. Over the last few decades, Nicaragua has experienced dictatorship, insurrection, revolution, Contra war, more than a decade of neoliberal structural adjustment policies and a number of disasters including Hurricane Mitch which hit Nicaragua in October 1998. The social and cultural context in which women mother is a complex one. Family life is unstable and fluid and Nicaragua has large numbers of single mothers. However, a number of institutional actors have attempted to undermine this complexity by trying to fix the meanings of motherhood, family, femininity, masculinity and sexuality in simplified and reified ways. These attempts contribute to the pervasiveness of dominant discourses of motherhood. In many ways, everyday practices of motherhood are at odds with dominant discourses and the goal of this thesis is to broaden understandings of the way motherhood intersects with other cultural processes in particular spaces and of how women negotiate competing facets of multiple identities. Based on qualitative research conducted in Matagalpa with a group of single mothers, this thesis explores a number of arenas in which women negotiate motherhood, including family breakdown, revolution and counterrevolution, structural adjustment and disaster, and demonstrates how everyday practices challenge dominant understandings. Given that individuals participate in a number of discursive practices simultaneously, the intersection of dominant discourses and everyday practices work to create specific geographies of mothering. This means for example that women might adopt more masculine subject positions in relation to work and family while engaging in maternal politics in the political sphere or that male violence towards women can be condemned and single motherhood adopted as a positive form of identity assertion while uneasiness is expressed about the absence of fathers in children&#8217;s lives. By contextualising the conditions in which women mother and focusing on how individual women feel about and reflect upon their lives, this study illustrates the multiple dimensions of motherhood which exist within Nicaraguan culture and the contradictions faced by women who mother in sites of intense cultural struggle. This study has important implications for the epistemological transformation that is taking place within feminist geography in particular and within human geography more broadly. Motherhood has the discursive power to shape and define gender identities, but it can also be used to unsettle or destabilise gender and sexuality in material and discursive space.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nicaragua</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">revolution</field><field name="subject">counterrevolution</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">disaster</field><field name="subject">motherhood</field><field name="subject">femininity</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution and maintenance of gender dimorphism in New Zealand Hebe (Scrophulariaceae).</field><field name="creator">Delph, Lynda F.</field><field name="description">The evolution and maintenance of gender dimorphism was investigated in the New Zealand genus Hebe (Scrophulariaceae). Hebe originated within New Zealand and gender dimorphism is postulated to have evolved separately four times within the genus. Gender was found to be controlled at least partially by nuclear genes for one species of Hebe. Most species are self-compatible, and H. subalpina was shown to exhibit inbreeding depression. The frequency of females was found to be negatively correlated with the amount of fruit set on the polleniferous (or male) morpho Dimorphism is correlated with altitude, and it is hypothesized, based on the pollinators present at different altitudes and degree to which they self-fertilize flowers, that separate sexes evolved in response to the increased level of self pollination that occurs at the higher altitudes. Female frequency varied greatly among the populations of H. strictissima, and was found to be negatively correlated with the relative seed fitness of the males. Fruit set on the males varied greatly in response to plant vigour within plants, among plants within populations, and among populations. Fruit set on females was not correlated with plant vigour, and varied less between populations. Female plants were more prevalent in relatively poor sites where male seed fitness was low. Gender estimates for H. subalpina, based on fruit set, sex ratio, seed production, inbreeding depression, and the rate of self-fertilization, showed that males received less than four per cent of their fitness through ovules. H. subalpina is, therefore, near the dioecy end of gynodioecy. Fruit set on males varies much more than that on females, and is dependent on both the status of individual shoots and the genotype of the plant. Resource allocation patterns differ according to sex, and reflect the way in which the sexes receive their fitness.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2548</field></doc></add>
