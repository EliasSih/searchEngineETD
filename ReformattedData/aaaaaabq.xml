Success in enterprise may support the achievement of a range of social, political and economic objectives for Indigenous peoples. The thesis offers a contribution to knowledge and literature on IED by bringing understanding to the meaning of success for Indigenous enterprise, identifying those factors that contribute to its success as well as presenting the barriers that prevent it. This study is the most recent rigorous scholarly work of IED on Indigenous land in the Northern Territory. The focus of this research is on Indigenous commercial enterprise development at a communal and individual level. Indigenous enterprise development is said to be different from other forms of enterprise development because of the legal rights of Indigenous peoples and because of particular cultural attributes, such as different perceptions of property rights in the Indigenous context and an emphasis on values like collectivism and sharing. These differences are found to shape notions of success and approaches to development. The research reviews literature in the international and domestic context on Indigenous economic development and Indigenous entrepreneurship. It also draws from internal and external documents of relevant institutions and news sources. These sources and findings are then built upon with fifty six in-depth, face-to-face interviews of selected participants who are experts or opinion leaders on IED in the region. These participants represented a variety of interest groups such as the government, academia, the Indigenous community and businesses from both Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures in the Northern Territory. This study used a qualitative research approach for data collection and analysis. The researcher utilized a qualitative data analysis method, including the reporting of field notes, preparation of field notes into transcripts, coding of data, display of data, the development of conclusions, and creation of a report. This study identified five categories of barriers to successful enterprise development on Indigenous land in the Northern Territory. These barriers are: high levels of conflict and mistrust, socio-cultural norms and values that can work against success, a lack of human capital, a poor institutional framework and economic and structural factors. There were four categories of factors found that support the development of successful Indigenous enterprise: developing business acumen, integrating culture within the enterprise, separating business from community politics and greater independence from government. While definitions of success varied across the region there were common objectives for Indigenous enterprise, such as eliminating welfare dependency and maintaining a link to land. Ultimately, success for Indigenous enterprise was deemed to be business survival, but in ways that are congruent with each Indigenous community?s values. The findings in this research emphasize that certain cultural attributes may act to constrain successful enterprise development, but can be integrated into an enterprise through changes in enterprise structure, or practice, to support successful economic outcomes. The research also emphasizes the importance of institutional settings on human capital and successful enterprise development in the region. This study?s findings can potentially guide and inform further research in this field. The research develops a number of policy recommendations which offer potential support to policymakers in addressing the important social problem of Indigenous disadvantage through enterprise development initiatives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal people</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Cultural industries</field><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Enterprise Development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Economic Development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Enterprise Development</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Economic Development and Growth</field><field name="subject">Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Public Policy</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Law</field><field name="subject">Law and Society</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Economic Development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Entrepreneurship</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48854</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35970</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assay and array technologies for G-protein coupled receptors.</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Kelly</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate strategies to aid in the measurement of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activity for high-throughput screening and sensing applications. GPCRs are cell surface receptors which have seven membrane spanning domains. They are the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and are involved in a number of physiological and pathophysiological pathways. They are the most widely targeted protein family for therapeutics being the target for over 30% of the currently available prescription drugs (Jacoby et al. 2006). For this reason commercial interest and investment into compound screening using these receptors as targets is of high importance in lead drug discovery. Additionally, the extensive ligand range of the GPCR superfamily, which includes light, odorants/ volatiles, neurotransmitters and hormones, make them an attractive biological recognition element in biosensor applications. This thesis demonstrates the functional expression of the H1-histamine, M2-muscarinic and &#945;&#8322;&#8336;-adrenergic receptors of the G-protein coupled receptor family, along with their associated G-proteins (G&#945;, G&#946; and G&#947;). Expression was achieved using the Sf9/baculovirus expression system. The G-proteins were successfully incorporated into an assay system using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TRFRET). TR-FRET was used in order to create a homogeneous assay format capable of monitoring GPCR activation through the movement of the G-protein subunits. Fluorescence changes in the TR-FRET assay indicated a change in distance between the G&#945; subunit and G&#946;&#947; dimer. The separation of the G&#945; subunit and the G&#946;&#947; dimer after activation resulted in a significant decrease in TR-FRET measurement. The homogeneous set-up of the TR-FRET assay could potentially be adaptable to an array based format. This thesis describes the capture of vesicles containing functional GPCRs onto a solid substrate via the specific interaction between complementary oligonucleotides. GPCR presence and function within the immobilized vesicles, was demonstrated using fluorescent ligands. Further to this, alternative lipid hosts (to the vesicles), known as cubosomes, were introduced. When tagged with an oligonucleotide, these cubosome particles were also shown to immobilize site specifically onto a complementary oligonucleotide surface.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">G-protein coupled receptors; TR-FRET; G-protein assay; membrane protein array; vesicles; oligonucleotide-directed immobilisation; cubosomes</field><field name="subject">G proteins Receptors.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59447</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometric neurodynamical classifiers applied to breast cancer detection.</field><field name="creator">Ivancevic, Tijana T.</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes four novel geometric neurodynamical classifier models, namely GBAM, Lie-derivative, Lie-Poisson, and FAM, applied to breast cancer detection.

A. The GBAM (generalized bidirectional associative memory) classifier is a neurodynamical, tensor-invariant classifier based on Riemannian geometry. The GBAM is a tensor-field system resembling a two-phase biological neural oscillator in which an excitatory neural field excites an inhibitory neural field, which reciprocally inhibits the excitatory one. This is a new generalization of Kosko&#8217;s BAM neural network, with a new biological (oscillatory, i.e., excitatory/inhibitory)interpretation. The model includes two nonlinearly-coupled (yet non-chaotic and Lyapunov stable) subsystems, activation dynamics and self-organized learning dynamics, including a symmetric synaptic 2-dimensional tensor-field, updated by differential Hebbian associative learning innovations. Biologically, the GBAM describes interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons found in the cerebellum, olfactory cortex, and neocortex, all representing the basic mechanisms for the generation of oscillating (EEG-monitored) activity in the brain. B. Lie-derivative neurodynamical classifier is an associative-memory, tensor-invariant neuro-classifier, based on the Lie-derivative operator from geometry of smooth manifolds. C. Lie-Poisson neurodynamical classifier is an associative-memory, tensor-invariant neuro-classifier based on the Lie-Poisson bracket from the generalized symplectic geometry. D. The FAM-matrix (fuzzy associative memory) dynamical classifier is a fuzzy-logic classifier based on a FAM-matrix (fuzzy phase-plane). All models are formulated and simulated in Mathematica computer algebra system. All models are applied to breast cancer detection, using the database from the University of Wisconsin and Mammography database. Classification results outperformed those obtained with standard MLP trained with backpropagation algorithm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">differential geometry; classifiers; breast cancer; diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59448</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High dietary salt during pregnancy in ewes alters the responses of offspring to an oral salt challenge.</field><field name="creator">Digby, Serina</field><field name="description">Most research to date has focused on non-pregnant sheep grazing saltbush to fill the summer/autumn feed gap in temperate regions of southern Australia. However, the summer/autumn period coincides with late pregnancy for autumn- or winter-lambing ewes, and feeding saltbush may reduce the amount and cost of supplementary feed that is required to meet the energy demands of late pregnancy. The challenge of dealing with a high-salt diet may be exacerbated during pregnancy since pregnancy is a salt-retaining physiological state, yet a high-salt intake requires an increase in mechanisms to excrete salt. The effect of high dietary salt on the developing foetus(es) has been studied in rodent models, but less so in sheep. Hence the aims of this thesis were to determine whether pregnant ewes can manage a high dietary salt content resembling that found in saltbush, and whether there are consequences to the offspring&#8217;s physiological responses to ingested salt. Merino ewes were synchronized for ovulation and artificially inseminated. To mimic the concentration of salt in animals grazing saltbush-based pastures in summer and autumn, a diet of 13% NaCl was fed from insemination through to parturition. It was found that pregnant ewes can be fed a 13% NaCl diet and manage the physiological conflict of high salt and pregnancy by decreasing their aldosterone concentrations and increasing their water consumption. There was no effect of high dietary salt on pregnancy rates, lamb birth weights, lamb survival or milk composition (fat and protein percentages). A series of experiments were conducted to test if the high-salt intake of ewes during pregnancy was associated with a change in the dietary preference for salt and/or changes in physiological responses to ingested salt in the offspring (&#8216;S lambs&#8217; vs. control, &#8216;C lambs&#8217;). C lambs and S lambs were exposed to short- and long-term preference testing to determine if there were differences in their voluntary selection for salt in their diet. There were no significant differences in dietary salt preference between C and S lambs. The lambs were subjected to salt 'challenges' (oral dose of 40 g NaCl in 25% w/v solution) from 3-10 months of age and their water intake, urinary output, sodium excretion and hormone concentrations were measured over the ensuing 23 hours, and compared against counterparts dosed with an equal volume of water without salt. Following the initial salt challenge further experiments were conducted with slight alterations; water intake was manipulated immediately following the salt challenge; two consecutive salt challenges, 8 hours apart, were administered; and C and S lambs were offered salty water (1.5% NaCl) over a period of two days. The results of these salt challenge experiments showed that C and S lambs excreted a salt load at a similar rate, but they differed in the magnitude of changes in water intake and hormone concentrations required to achieve sodium homeostasis. S lambs were able excrete sodium at the same rate as C lambs but without decreasing aldosterone concentrations to the same extent and whilst consuming 400 mL less water in the first two hours post challenge. The aldosterone results suggested a lowered responsiveness to aldosterone and the lower water consumption suggested an altered thirst threshold. The experiment in which water consumption was manipulated suggested that when the supply or access to fresh water is limited, the capacity to remove a salt load is likely to be less impaired in S lambs than C lambs; S lambs were able to excrete the salt load faster than the C lambs when the availability of drinking water was limited. From the experiment in which lambs were treated with two consecutive salt challenges, the rate of sodium excretion increased after the second dose, but there remained no difference in the rate of excretion between C and S lambs; all animals were able to excrete 95% of the administered dose of sodium within 23 hours. The final experiment in which animals were given salty water (1.5% NaCl) for a period of two days showed consistent results with the previous experiments for water consumption and aldosterone concentrations between C and S lambs. There was no difference in sodium excretion between C and S lambs. A novel finding was a markedly lower voluntary feed intake in S lambs than C lambs. Although mechanisms for this are unknown, it may have profound effects on the productivity of the animals. The experiments reported in this thesis provide new information of relevance to pregnant ewes grazing halophytic forages. It is apparent that they can withstand a high NaCl content typical, of a saltbush-based pasture. Further work is warranted to conclude whether high salt during pregnancy is (i) beneficial to the offspring in regards to a higher capacity to deal with excess salt under farming conditions and (ii) consistently associated with a lower voluntary feed intake of the offspring.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">saltbush, salt tolerance, lambing, sodium in lambs, halophytic forages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59449</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of PpMDHARs and PpENA1 from the moss, Physcomitrella patens.</field><field name="creator">Drew, Damian Paul</field><field name="description">Identifying a genetic basis for the tolerance to salinity exhibited by the resilient moss, Physcomitrella patens, could provide valuable information for use in the selection or modification of salinity tolerance in crop plants. The overall aim of the work described in this thesis was to identify, express and functionally characterise the protein products of two putative salinity tolerance genes from Physcomitrella, namely PpMdhar and PpENA1. The characterisation of PpMdhar and PpENA1 represents a two-pronged approach into investigating the salinity tolerance of Physcomitrella at the biochemical and transport level, respectively. The enzymes encoded by PpMdhars, monodehydroascorbate reductases (MDHARs), are central to the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, and recycle monodehydroascorbate molecules into the antioxidant, ascorbate. Hence, MDHARs play a part in maintaining the capacity of plant cells to remove toxic reactive oxygen species. Given that the production of reactive oxygen species is greatly increased in plants under salt stress, and that Physcomitrella is tolerant of high salt, MDHAR enzymes were expressed to determine whether they exhibit increased enzymic activity when compared with MDHARs from higher plants. The protein encoded by PpENA1 is Na&#8314; transporting ATPase, which actively transports toxic Na&#8314; ions across the cell membranes, and thereby minimizes the level of Na&#8314; that accumulates in the cytoplasm. Thus, in contrast to the mechanism by which MDHARs may help Physcomitrella deal with the secondary effects of high salt, the PpENA1 protein could enable the moss to actively exclude Na&#8314; ions, and thereby avoid cellular toxicity. A link between salinity and the transcription of PpMdhar and PpENA1 is reported here, and the function of each gene is investigated. A comprehensive characterisation of the enzymic action of expressed PpMDHAR enzymes is described, demonstrating that the biochemical mechanisms used by Physcomitrella in dealing with salt-induced reactive oxygen species are likely to be conserved with vascular plants. The physiological effects of the expression of PpENA1 are investigated via complementation experiments in yeast, and the membrane location of the protein is determined. The Na&#8314; binding-sites of PpENA1 are predicted using homology modelling and amino acid residues crucial for Na&#8314; transport are tested experimentally via site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, the introduction of a new, functional Na&#8314; binding-site into an inactivated form of the PpENA1 protein demonstrates that a degree of control is possible over the Na&#8314; binding-sites in PpENA1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity tolerance; monodehydroascorbate; PpENA1; ATPase; physcomitrella</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59450</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Removal of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol from drinking water through biologically active sand filters.</field><field name="creator">McDowall, Bridget</field><field name="description">This thesis outlines results of a series of studies investigating the removal of two common taste and odour compounds, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin, from drinking water using biologically active sand filtration. A combination of full-, pilot- and laboratory-scale studies were carried out.  A review of long term water quality data from a South Australian water treatment plant indicated that the conventional plant was capable of removing MIB and geosmin to below detection limit without the need for additional treatment. A series of laboratory studies were carried out, validating the theory that the geosmin removal was occurring through biological activity in the rapid gravity filters of the water treatment plant.  Microorganisms capable of geosmin removal were found to be present in the settled water of two South Australian water treatment plants, Morgan and Happy Valley. Laboratory sand column experiments were conducted with these waters and a range of sand media, investigating the effect of biofilm development on MIB and geosmin biodegradation. It was found that the process could produce effective removals, however long start-up  periods were often required. A laboratory-scale column utilising new sand fed with Happy Valley settled water took in excess of 300 days before it was capable of removing MIB and geosmin by greater than 80%. Studies on sands with inactivated pre-existing biofilms required much shorter biofilm development periods, from 30 to 40 days. The results of the column studies indicated that a method to encourage sand filters to operate biologically for  MIB and geosmin removal would be advantageous. Two methods were studied: preozonation  and bacterial inoculation.  Pre-ozonation was carried out at a pilot plant, constructed at the Happy Valley water treatment plant. Additional factors investigated during this study were the length of the biofilm development period and the impact of empty bed contact time (EBCT). Preozonation is often used in tandem with biological filtration to increase the fraction of biodegradable organic matter and in turn increase the biomass activity of the filter. The  pilot plant consisted of two sand filters; one fed with settled water and one fed with preozonated  settled water. Pre-ozonation did not enhance the biodegradation of MIB or geosmin. The pre-ozonated column was run for 550 days. Removals of MIB and geosmin  were inconsistent throughout the trial. The maximum removal obtained during the study  was 80% for MIB and geosmin, at an EBCT of 45 minutes, after 380 days of operation.  The settled water column was run for over 650 days. By day 560, the column was able to remove 60% of the influent geosmin and 40% of the influent MIB at an EBCT of 10 minutes, which is close to that used in full-scale plants. Significant effects of empty bed contact time were not noted in the range of 10 to 30 minutes. Bacterial inoculation studies were carried out at laboratory-scale. The inoculum comprised of a geosmin-degrading consortium of three Gram-negative bacteria previously isolated from the biofilm of the Morgan water treatment plant filter sand. A sand column with a  pre-existing biofilm was inoculated with the organisms, achieving 70% removal of geosmin. Inoculation of columns without biofilms gave lower geosmin removals, with an  average of 41% removal. These were preliminary studies only, and further work is  required.  A biomass activity assay, based on the concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), was developed over the course of the project. This assay was particularly helpful when studying  the attachment of the inoculum in the laboratory columns. Other methods to study biomass  were flow cytometry to enumerate the water-borne and biofilm associated bacteria, and scanning electron microscopy to obtain a visual observation of the biofilms on various  sands.  This work demonstrated the potential of biological sand filtration for MIB and geosmin control. It was shown that long biofilm development periods are evident before effective removal of the compounds can occur. The potential to minimise these long biofilm  development periods by inoculation of filters with geosmin degrading organisms was demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geosmin; 2-methylisoborneol; biological filtration; drinking water</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59451</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Directed unfolding: reachability analysis of concurrent systems &amp; applications to automated planning.</field><field name="creator">Hickmott, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">The factored state representation and concurrency semantics of Petri nets are closely related to those of classical planning models, yet automated planning and Petri net analysis have developed independently, with minimal and mainly unconvincing attempts at crossfertilisation. This thesis exploits the relationship between the formal reachability problem, and the automated planning problem, via Petri net unfolding, which is an attractive reachability analysis method for highly concurrent systems as it facilitates reasoning about independent sub-problems. The first contribution of this thesis is the theory of directed unfolding: controlling the unfolding process with informative strategies, for the purpose of optimality and increased efficiency. The second contribution is the application of directed unfolding to automated planning. Inspired by well-known planning heuristics, this thesis shows how problem specific information can be employed to guide unfolding, in response to the formal problem of developing efficient, directed reachability analysis methods for concurrent systems. Complimenting this theoretical work, this thesis presents a new forward search method for partial order planning which can be exponentially more efficient than state space search. Our suite of planners based on directed unfolding can perform optimal and suboptimal classical planning subject to arbitrary action costs, optimal temporal planning with respect to arbitrary action durations, and address probabilistic planning via replanning for the most likely path. Empirical results reveal directed unfolding is competitive with current state of the art automated planning systems, and can solve Petri net reachability problems beyond the reach of the original &#8220;blind&#8221; unfolding technique.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AI planning; Petri net unfolding; reachability analysis; directed unfolding; heuristic search; partial order reduction; concurrent systems; discrete event systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59452</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical remodelling of the atria and pulmonary veins due to stretch in rheumatic mitral stenosis.</field><field name="creator">John, Bobby</field><field name="description">Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia; however, its mechanism is not well understood. Several conditions such as valvular disease, heart failure, and hypertension predispose to atrial fibrillation. Identifying the electrophysiological substrate in these clinical conditions would yield insight into the mechanism of atrial fibrillation and aid in developing strategies to prevent or cure it. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is associated with high prevalence of atrial fibrillation. While atrial stretch itself may be adequate to explain the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in this population, it is not known if the disease process would remodel the atria so as to increase its propensity. Chapters 2 and 3 present the results of the studies evaluating the substrate for atrial fibrillation in both the left and right atria in rheumatic mitral stenosis. These studies have demonstrated extensive conduction abnormalities both regional and site specific associated with low voltage area and scar. Despite the prolonged atrial refractoriness, the propensity for atrial fibrillation was increased; lending support to the theory that structural remodelling associated with conduction abnormalities plays a greater role in the substrate predisposing to atrial fibrillation. Chapters 4 and 5 present the results of the studies evaluating the immediate effects of chronic atrial stretch reversal on the atrial electrical remodelling. These studies demonstrated that immediately after percutaneous mitral commissurotomy there was decrease in P wave duration, improvement in site specific conduction delay and conduction velocity associated with increase in the voltage. However, there was no change in atrial refractoriness. Chapter 6 studies the substrate long-term after reduction of stretch. There was further increase in conduction velocity and voltage associated with decrease in atrial refractoriness and conduction delay across the crista terminalis. These observations suggest that strategies aimed at reducing atrial stretch in different disease conditions would potentially decrease the burden or prevent atrial fibrillation. There is mounting evidence of the effect of stretch on the atria; however, the effect of stretch on the triggers of atrial fibrillation has not been evaluated before. Chapter 7 and 8 present the results of the study examining the effect of acute and chronic stretch on human pulmonary veins. Simultaneous pacing of the right ventricle and pulmonary vein induced acute stretch. The effect of chronic stretch was evaluated in patients with mitral stenosis. The atrial refractoriness was abbreviated in acute stretch while it was prolonged in the chronic form. Nevertheless, both resulted in marked pulmonary vein conduction abnormalities that were pronounced with chronic stretch and extra-stimuli. Additionally, structural remodelling was seen with chronic stretch. These abnormalities implicate stretch in the milieu for re-entry and pulmonary vein arrhythmogenesis in conditions predisposed to atrial fibrillation. In summary, this thesis has evaluated the effects of stretch on the substrate and triggers of atrial fibrillation. It provides evidence for the importance of structural changes and the associated abnormalities in conduction in predisposing to atrial fibrillation. These observations may be important in the development of tools to treat, cure and prevent atrial fibrillation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rheumatic mitral stenosis; atrial remodelling; pulmonary vein; stretch</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59453</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of a polyunsaturated fatty acid mimetic on the development of atherosclerosis in the apoE deficient mouse.</field><field name="creator">Moheimani, Fatemeh</field><field name="description">Atheroma, heart attacks and strokes continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our community.  Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease, characterised by  thickening of the vascular wall due to lipid accumulation, infiltration by circulating monocytes and T cells and proliferation of smooth muscle cells.  Leukocyte adherence to the blood vessel wall is promoted by the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) by atherogenic substances such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;) and oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxidised-LDL).  Recently our group has synthesised a novel polyunsaturated fatty acid, &#946;-oxa 23:4n-6 which inhibits CAM up-regulation in blood vessel walls.  It was therefore the objective of this thesis to determine whether this fatty acid protects against atherosclerosis.  Advantage was taken of an experimental model of this disease, the apoE deficient mouse (apoE [superscript -/-]) which spontaneously develop atherosclerosis. To assist our studies on MP3, we established an appropriate classification of different stages of atherosclerotic lesions and defined the kinetics of development of the disease in this model.  By examining of the sections at the level of aortic roots the atherosclerotic lesions were classified into six categories.  This classification was based on the histological characteristics of the plaque component including the degree of macrophage infiltration and foam cells formation, the presence of cholesterol clefts and confluent lipid cores, calcification and ossification, the composition of the fibrous cap, the media involvement and the incipient/actual aneurysm formation and inflammation, including neutrophils. Kinetics of plaque development under the influence of a high fat and high cholesterol diet followed an exponential relationship of y= -e [ superscript -x ].  The asymptotic characteristic of this lesion development was however a function of compensatory aortic enlargement which accompanied the increase in lesion development and size.  Thus it is concluded that the level of atherosclerosis needs to be gauged by the size of the lesion per se.  This may be particularly important for the assessment of anti-atherogenic effects of drugs.  Therefore attempts to develop a quantitative system to assess plaques revealed that expression of plaque size as % of occupation of blood vessel had limitations.  Using this model we were able to demonstrate that injections of the novel polyunsaturated fatty acid, MP3 led to a significant reduction/inhibition (70%) of plaque area and a corresponding 60% inhibition of aortic size.  As expected this inhibition was not as evident when results were expressed as % of aortic lumen size.  The results also suggested that protection by MP3 was dependent on conditions which promoted increased uptake into tissues by, for example, preloading animals with MP3 prior to commencing the high fat high cholesterol diet.  The protective effects of MP3 are consistent with a role for the activation of the transcriptional factor, NFkB and up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules in this disease, and the ability of MP3 to inhibit these targets.  Thus the objective of this research has been achieved and the hypothesis proven.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atherosclerosis, unsaturated fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59454</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical reactions of polyphosphate fertilisers in soils and solutions.</field><field name="creator">McBeath, Therese</field><field name="description">Polyphosphates have been shown to offer substantial agronomic benefits over traditional granular phosphorus (P) fertilisers in highly calcareous soils of southern Australia. With ongoing field investigations into the efficiency of polyphosphate fertilisers compared to fluid and granular orthophosphate (OP) fertiliser products, a need developed for detailed study of the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced efficiency of polyphosphate fertilisers in Australian soil types. Polyphosphates provide an analytical challenge as they contain chemically different forms of phosphate compared to most fertilisers, where P occurs entirely as OP. An investigation was conducted into the most suitable method for the speciation, quantification and separation of the P species supplied in polyphosphate fertilisers. While the conventionally used colorimetric technique was comparable to ion chromatography (IC) for quantification of OP, it did not provide the speciation and separation capabilities of IC. Polyphosphate fertilisers are thermodynamically unstable and hydrolyse to more simple forms of phosphate: this can be induced both chemically and biologically. A study was undertaken using IC to ascertain the effects of time, temperature and acidity on the stability of polyphosphate fertiliser formulations. All of these factors affected the stability of polyphosphate fertilisers and recommendations on storage of the product and mixtures with other fluid fertilisers can now be developed. Stability of PP in soils was assessed using solid-state speciation by solid-state &#179;&#185;P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Hydrolysis of both solution and solid-phase PP could be quantified using the NMR technique, and results using this method were compared to conventional techniques, which extract OP and PP into aqueous phases and use IC to assess the extent of PP hydrolysis. The concentrations of OP and PP determined by the extraction technique were lower than those determined by NMR, and consequently the proportion of undetected P was greater for IC than for NMR. There is disagreement in the literature as to the differences in partitioning behaviour (sorption/precipitation) of OP and PP in soil. A partitioning study was undertaken using the IC technique for aqueous P speciation. Retention of PP to soil solid phases was much stronger than OP, and addition of PP to soil resulted in greater concentrations of OP in the equilibrating solutions, indicating a possible competition for P sorption sites between PP and OP. A double labelling technique was developed where OP was labelled with &#179;&#179;OP and PP was labelled with &#179;&#178;PP. This technique was used to investigate the effects of time and concentration on the lability and partitioning of OP and PP in soils. Using this dual labeling technique it was possible to determine the hydrolysis of added PP, and to distinguish OP derived from hydrolysis of PP from native OP in soil. The dissolution of dissolved organic carbon, iron and aluminium and the sorption/precipitation of calcium as a result of addition of PP were assessed and related to changes in the lability of P supplied as PP and OP. This double labelling technique was further developed to assess the possibility of mobilisation of native OP by addition of PP to soil. The findings of this thesis indicate that the hydrolysis reaction is pivotal to the behaviour of the P species that constitute a polyphosphate fertiliser in soils. Investigations of isotopic exchangeability showed that while native P mobilisation was not detected, slow reactions of PP in soil including sorption, potentially desorption, and hydrolysis underpin the potential availability of PP in soil.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphatic fertilizers, polyposphates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59455</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday spirituality : supporting the spiritual experience of young children in three early childhood educational settings : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bone, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is the spiritual experience of young children in early childhood educational settings. Spirituality is included in the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, Te Whariki, but is a relatively unarticulated aspect of educational practice. In order to find out how spirituality is supported in early childhood educational contexts this qualitative case study research took place in three early childhood settings: a Montessori casa, a private preschool and a Steiner (Waldorf) kindergarten. The methods used in the research included participant observation, interviews and focus groups. The teachers were asked to make a video about spirituality to reflect their own context and photographs were taken in each setting. The metaphor of spiritual landscape is used in this research. In this landscape everyday experience merged with the spiritual to form the concept of everyday spirituality. The cultural theories of everyday life supported a realisation that ordinary daily activity can become wonderful and mysterious when the spiritual dimension is realised. The themes that emerged from analysis of the case studies are conceptualised as transformative aspects of learning and relationships. They are aspects of everyday spirituality identified as spiritual withness; spiritual inbetweenness; and the spiritually elsewhere. Representing spiritual experience is challenging. The thesis is written in narrative form and contains core narratives as prose and poems. Using writing as a means of discovery made communicating spirituality through the medium of words a possibility. Spirituality is proposed to be an inclusive concept that affirms a sense of connection and this thesis found that all pedagogical practices in early childhood settings have the potential to include a spiritual aspect. In Aotearoa New Zealand many children lead their everyday lives in the context of an early childhood environment that includes teachers and parents as part of that community. This thesis argues that when everyday spirituality permeates early childhood contexts that all aspects of the curriculum are realised and the spiritual experience of everyone connected to that setting is supported.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">spiritual landscape</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/623</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expectations, emerging issues and change for Chinese international students in a New Zealand university : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Skyrme, Gillian Ray</field><field name="description">This study uses a sociocultural framework to trace the experiences of 24 Chinese international undergraduate students studying business and information sciences in a New Zealand university, using community of practice perspectives recognising the university as a site of complex discourses requiring negotiation of new identities and practices. The students&#8217; expectations, the issues that emerged and the processes of change they went through to meet their goals were investigated from retrospective and longitudinal viewpoints, using semi-structured interviews supported by schematic representations developed by the researcher and photographic representations compiled by participants were. The findings suggest that preparation before departure focused largely on expected English demands, rather than wider matters of academic culture, and this was only partially rectified during prior study in New Zealand. Students thus entered the university unfamiliar with its specific discourses and found conditions for resolving difficulties more limited than previously experienced. The anonymity and extreme time pressure pertaining in large first-year classes led to bewilderment about requirements, threats to the sense of identity as competent students which they had arrived with, and often, failure of courses. Nevertheless, the investment, personal and monetary, which this journey represented provided the incentive to persevere. Most students were resourceful in negotiating a fit between their learning preferences and the affordances of the university, resulting in very different journeys for each of them. Measures adopted included those sanctioned by the university, such as developing skills to meet the demands of academic literacies, and others less valued, such as extreme dependence on teacher consultation. Success was gained through personal agency which proved more important than the university goal of student autonomy. Beyond the academic arena, other activities such as part-time jobs were significant in contributing to a sense of identity as competent and educated adults, and to new viewpoints which contrasted with original cultural norms. They continued to identify as Chinese, but in a &#8220;third space&#8221; owing something to New Zealand influences. The study concludes that entry criteria should include a component of university preparation. It also recommends measures by which the university might enhance the experiences of such students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese international students</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/793</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participatory approaches to development : an analysis of the experiences of development projects in Sudan : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">El Gack, Nawal El-Gaili</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to explore and analyse the experiences of participatory development projects in Sudan. The study focuses on participation in development, an issue that has attracted debate and discussion since the early 1970s. To contribute to this discussion and create more knowledge on this issue the White Nile Agricultural Services Project (WNASP) and North Kordofan Rural Development Project (NKRDP) were selected as case studies. Through various methods the nature and potential of participatory development approaches and interventions have been explored with the aim of identifying the factors that influenced people's participation, and suggesting ways to improve the practice of participatory development at grassroots level. The study found that although the projects encouraged and claimed to adopt participatory approaches, people were not engaged in a process through which participation could achieve empowerment or create real changes in their lives. The outcome of people's participation in the projects was influenced by development providers' policies, credibility and behaviour of staff, nature and amount of resources, socio-cultural norms, power relations, and communities' previous experiences, organisation and level of education. This suggests that primarily, designing participatory development programmes requires an in-depth understanding of prevailing social, economic, political and physical environments. Secondly, development providers should adopt approaches that accept negotiations with communities and challenge oppressive situations. Finally, if participatory development is to achieve its objectives, local communities must be provided with resources, information and skills. Based on evidence from powerful individuals in North Kordofan, this thesis suggests a moral-obligatory approach as one of the ways to improve the practice of participatory development in Sudan. This approach requires a fundamental change in development providers' policies, visions and credibility. If the essence of participatory development is adhered to, and if strategies and plans are designed collectively then there is an opportunity for making real change in the lives of those addressed by development interventions. This thesis concludes that more research is needed to explore the values, role, and impact of development providers and facilitators, as well as the nature and potential of local communities' participative values, organisations and practices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Participatory development</field><field name="subject">Project case studies</field><field name="subject">Community participation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360299 Policy and administration not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1455</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mindful self : sense of self and health-promoting lifestyle behaviours among Thai college women : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mongkhonsiri, Pitsini</field><field name="description">Wellness educators have faced a great challenge to develop strategies to move people toward the adoption of positive lifestyle behaviours. This research explores concepts of self and the impact of Thai culture on the motivation of young college women to engage in health-promoting lifestyle behaviours (HPLBs) in the context of northeastern Thailand. A sequential mixed methods design enables an exploration of the relationships among sense of coherence, identity status, and HPLBs in the first phase, and an inductive analysis of the impact of Thai cultural context in the second phase. In study A, three instruments: the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Behaviors Profile II (HPLP II), the Extended Version of the Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status (EOM-EIS), and the Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC-29), were used with 350 senior college women. Sense of Coherence was significantly correlated with achieving a sense of identity, lessening diffusion identity and engaging in health-promoting behaviours. Although a considerable proportion of the variance (26.7 %) for engaging in HPLBs was accounted for by SOC, identity achievement, and identity moratorium, the magnitude of the unexplained variance was considerable. This led to inductive exploration of other variables influencing HPLBs in Study B. By data-driven thematic analysis, the Model of the Mindful Self emerged from in-depth interviews with 25 college women. The model describes three main themes: (a) the cultural background and the surrounding ongoing influences which impact on the development of Thai women's sense of self and their health-related behaviours, (b) the sense of self and identity formation in the Thai context, and (c) the health-related behaviours that stem from the sense of self. Sense of self and its behaviours are socially constructed within the specific culture in which individuals are embedded. The social phenomena and research outcomes are interpreted under the lens of social constructionism. The knowledge generated by this study provides guidance for teaching about health promotion in Thai undergraduate nursing programmes and also provides a basis for initiating health-promoting programmes based on the individual's sense of self for female adolescents in Thailand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health and identity</field><field name="subject">Health behaviour</field><field name="subject">Nursing student health</field><field name="subject">Female student health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1456</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prostitute and her community in late-medieval London</field><field name="creator">Norrie, Jasmine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationship between prostitute, law, and community in late-medieval London.

Don) forests</field><field name="creator">Noonan, M. J.</field><field name="description">Early in 1962 the Forest Research Institute of the New Zealand Forest Service became aware that stands of second crop Pinus radiata (D. Don) on some areas of the Moutere Gravel formation were showing slow growth and had a chlorotic appearance (Fig. 1.1). The second crop followed clear felling of mature P. radiata trees and were aged from 0 to 15 years (stone and Will, 1965). It was felt that the apparent reduced growth of the second generation had much in common with similar productivity decline reported especially in European forestry literature. Stone and Will (1965) postulated that the immediate cause o&#163; the decline was a deficiency of nitrogen highlighted by the low levels of nitrogen in the leaves of the second crop trees, especially those growing on ridge sites. Numerous field trials have been laid out but many of the trials were poorly designed and consequently could not provide statistically sound results. However, some indication of nutrient deficiencies which occur on the Moutere Gravels were obtained. Even before these trials were laid down nutrient deficiencies had been highlighted by early attempts at farming. It was the partial failure of these crops that initially led to the planting of exotic pines, in the belief that these trees thrived on a limited supply of nutrients. The first crop of pines generally fulfilled expectations but nutrient deficiencies started to appear in extensive areas of the second crop. Accordingly, the Forest Research Institute made available three scholarships to study different aspects of the problem. Work was started on a study of the soil sequence across the Moutere Gravels to determine if there was a general decline in fertility of tho soil with the age of the soil and the environmental factors, such as climate which differs in the high inland areas and the low seaside areas of the Moutere Gravels, rather than a particular decline in fertility induced by the first crop of P. radiata. In another study the major weed species Ulex europaeus and Cytisus scoparius was studied to see if its value as a nitrogen fixer would outweigh its disadvantages as a silvicultural weed. Thirdly, a study of the microbial ecology of the soils was undertaken. Whyte (1966) reported that the second rotation trees started to increase their growth rate after approximately five years to a level paralleling the estimated growth rate of the first crop. It was postulated that the residues (needles, roots and branches) remaining after clear felling could cause an increase in microbial numbers and activity with a consequent immobilization of mineral nutrients which were not initially very plentiful. For this reason an area in Tasman Forest was selected in which mature trees and regeneration up to nine years old were found together to study microbial activity and numbers, energy dissipation and nitrogen dynamics to determine if immobilization of nutrients was causing the apparent declines.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">microbial ecosystems</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">microbial populations</field><field name="subject">mineral nitrogen fluctuations</field><field name="subject">nitrogen mineralisation</field><field name="subject">microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270307 Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300201 Plant biochemistry and physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1594</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial leadership : a historical analysis of merchant shipping</field><field name="creator">Clydesdale, Greg</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to explore the forces that determine the rise and fall of industrial leadership. It attempted to do this by applying an industry life cycle model to the shipping industry. The industrial life cycle was posited on the basis of existing literature, particularly the growth of knowledge, evolutionary and institutional literature, which lend themselves to patterns of industrial growth and entrapment. On this basis, this thesis set out to examine whether industrial leadership can be explained by a four-staged process of imitation, catch up, advance and entrapment. However, this thesis has exposed something more complicated. Processes of imitation, catch up advance and entrapment were shown to be at work in the shipping industry, but they were tempered by the effects of military and political forces that may not be exogenous, and the trend from regionalism to globalisation. The original model did not encompass early indigenous developments that are not based on imitation that do not immediately lead to a position of advanced leadership. In this light, a better description of the first stage would be capability building.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary economics</field><field name="subject">economic history</field><field name="subject">shipping</field><field name="subject">maritime industries</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340205 Industry economics and industrial organisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340211 Transport economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1712</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial aspects of bumble bee (Bombus spp. Apidae) foraging in farm landscapes</field><field name="creator">Schaffer, M. J.</field><field name="description">Bumble bees (Bombus spp.: Apidae) are valuable pollinators of many crop and wildflower species. However, in some situations their potential is limited. Evaluation of, and management to improve bumble bee efficacy should include spatial information which is currently limited. Distance and direction determine the success of gene flow via pollen cross-over within and between plant populations at several scales. Studies of movement by bumble bees at large scales in semi-natural and intensively managed habitats are scarce. Few studies of bumble bee dispersal from the nest exist, particularly in relation to crops. At a small scale, directional rather than random movement between flowers has benefits for pollen flow. Results to date of directionality studies at small scales and their interpretation are inconsistent. The purpose of this thesis was to assess distances and directions moved by foraging bumble bees at a range of scales in two contrasting farm habitats in order to predict their pollination potential.  A novel method was developed to mark automatically all the occupants of nests of bumble bees B. terrestris (L.) placed around a Lucerne seed crop Medicago sativa L. in New Zealand. Reobservation data from eight nests showed that of bumble bees which foraged within the crop, 81 % travelled &#8804; 50 m and 56% &#8804; 20 m from their nest. Results should be interpreted with extreme caution because fewer than 1 % of bumble bees marked at nests were reobserved in the crop. Because it was not established where the other 99% of the bumble bees went, foraging areas for nests could not be calculated as anticipated. Theories to explain the non-specificity of bumble bees to the crop include; resource depletion near nests, competition with honey bees in the crop, or an evolved strategy to disperse in order to minimise nest predation. Lucerne flowers contained a significantly lower concentration of sugar in nectar, and significantly fewer pollen grains than did those of purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria L., a species on which bumble bees appeared to forage in preference Lucerne. The higher rewards offered by L. salicaria may have diverted bumble bees from the less-rewarding Lucerne crop.  In a Norwegian meadow system, all foraging bouts by bumble bees B. lucorum (L.) within a patch of wood cranesbill flowers Geranium sylvaticum L. were random with respect to direction. This result is not consistent with predictions, based on optimal foraging theory, that movement should be directional to enable optimal pollen flow, and to avoid revisitation of just-emptied flowers by the pollinator. A medium-scale study of several bumble bee species moving between patches of northern wolfsbane Aconitum septentrionale Koelle in Norway revealed considerable loyalty by bumble bees to patches in which they were marked. In a different landscape-scale study (over 5 ha), several bumble bees exhibited a high degree of loyalty to areas in which they were marked (87% were reobserved &#8804; 50 m from marking points). These restricted movement patterns are discussed in terms of potential pollen flow. Of 260 bumble bees marked, only five were recorded crossing between meadows, which could be a result of innate loyalty to small forage areas, an artefact of the sampling technique used, or forest boundaries acting as physical impediments to movement.  In the future, spatial data of the type collected in this thesis will aid in the management of bumble bee populations to achieve both commercial and conservation goals. Spatial data can be applied to predict the optimal placement of artificially-reared nests, predict suitable isolation distances for pure seed crops, and aid in the positioning of supplementary forage sources and nest-site refuges.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bumble bee</field><field name="subject">Bombus</field><field name="subject">foraging behaviour</field><field name="subject">pollination</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">spatial approach</field><field name="subject">scale</field><field name="subject">distance</field><field name="subject">direction</field><field name="subject">foraging area</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">seed crop</field><field name="subject">Norway</field><field name="subject">meadow</field><field name="subject">pollen</field><field name="subject">nectar</field><field name="subject">060808 - Invertebrate Biology</field><field name="subject">0703 - Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2243</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music educational and ethnomusicological implications for curriculum design: development, implementation and evaluation of Philippine music and dance curricula</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Philomena S.</field><field name="description">The problem of concern in this study is of a dual nature, involving music education principles and ethnomusicological issues. Using Philippine music and dance as the specific genre, the study investigates approaches to the learning of non-Western music at the secondary school level. The study identifies two approaches which may lead to the Philippine music and dance learning experience, designs curricula in two appropriate forms, and, finally, sets up conditions to test empirically the relative effectiveness of the curricula.The initial task for this study was to locate and collect Philippine music and dance data, by means of field work, during which the researcher acted as participant and observer in Philippine events. From this data, the study attempted to design, implement and evaluate Philippine music and dance curricula in two forms, with both curricula developed from identical music and dance materials and principals.The first form. Curriculum A, is a fifteen hour curriculum which presents the music and dance as entities in themselves, worthy of study in their own right. The second form. Curriculum B, is a fifteen hour curriculum in a cross-disciplinary form, seeking relationships between music, dance and socio-cultural variables. Following the development of the curricula, selected teachers were prepared to implement one or other of the randomly assigned curricula forms with 521 Year 8 and Year 9 pupils in a stratified random sample of New South Wales secondary schools. The sample was stratified according to four school-related variables, five teacher-related variables and three pupi1-related variables.Finally, this study attempted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the two curricula by devising one Philippine music and dance achievement test. The test evaluates pupils in the areas of knowledge and skills in Philippine music and dance. The test also seeks pupils' attitudes towards Philippine music and dance in particular, and non-Western music and dance in general. Analysis of variance was employed to establish the more effective curriculum form, and to ascertain the effects of selected intervening variables upon the two Philippine music and dance curricula.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1332</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational structure and the locational behaviour of small and medium scale firms in metropolitan Colombo, Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Dias, N.

However, it has been recognised that there exist fundamental structural differences among the firms in this sector in Sri Lanka. Small and medium scale industrial sector consisting of so-called registered and unregistered firms, different structural features reflect differences in size, capital investment, ownership pattern, family participation, raw material utilisation, export orientation and the relationships with government organisations. These structural differences go some considerable way towards explaining the behaviour of small and medium scale manufacturing firms in Colombo, and the general hypothesis is that the nature of the interactions of small enterprises depend upon their internal organisational structure.The study focussed on three types of industries (textile, rubber and metal) in identifying the organisational structure of firms and in analysing the relationships between organisational structure and functional linkages, attitudes of entrepreneurs, patterns and degree of locational adjustments and the different responses of small firms to change in government policy. The study uses a sample of I36 firms and data and information were based on a questionnaire survey and extensive fieldwork in Sri Lanka, conducted during the period from January to July, 1984.Principal components analysis has been used to define the structure of firms and to identify the significant characteristics of industries. The extent to which the organisational structure of firms is reflected in their behaviour was investigated by means of correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses. The study also recognises the importance of government policies which are important in terms of spatial pattern and structure of small and medium scale industries in Colombo and the way in which industries have perceived these policies and responded to them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1386</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Foucauldian analysis of development banking lending practices: a case study of the Fiji development Bank (FDB) 1967-1997</field><field name="creator">Deo, Hemant Narayan</field><field name="description">The Fiji Development Bank (FDB) in its development lending operations has undergone stmctural and cultural changes over the past nimiber of years. This research examines the bank's lending operations for the past thirty years (1967-1997), using a Foucauldian theoretical framework. The history of the bank's development lending practices can be described as discursive formations or discontinuities where the issue of 'land' has dominated the entire development banking (lending) fi-amework. A Foucauldian theoretical firamework brings out the concepts of archaeology and genealogy with builtin power and knowledge effects that are apparent, within the operations of the FDB and which can be interpreted as a disciplinary regime that provides a disciplinary surveiUance of the development banking operations within the Fijian context. The bank was formed in 1967 with two main lending divisions, namely agricultural and commercial, and was set-up to encourage development financing so as to foster the economic growth of Fiji. Therefore, the bank was wiUing to undertake and finance loans with less security undertakings than other commercial banks. This unique financing operation was made possible, to some extent, by govemment subsidies given to the bank. However, in 1994 the bank underwent a dynamic stmctural change with the introduction of the bank's new corporate plan which brought in a new corporate philosophy or culture which was profit-orientated. The bank underwent a massive loan review exercise, (or clean-up process) in relation to its entire lending portfolios: the focus of lending which was traditionally 'volume' - or 'quantity' - based on agricultural lending, also saw a new concept being introduced in the lending process a 'quality' base with a more commercial - lending focus. The corporate plan also changed the names of the lending divisions, which were now called profit centres and which were performance based. The lending officers were also now judged on their given lending portfolios in relation to their job tasks. Various management reports such as the Lending Management Information Systems (LMIS), Performance Appraisal Reports (PAR) and budgets, kept the management informed as to the overall operations of the bank. In relation to the lending process there was a greater disciplinary surveillance provided by the various profit centres to ensure that targets within the set budgets were met. From a Foucauldian perspective it can be appreciated that analysing such a case study brings out a new way of seeing things, and also provides a filtering process whereby the development banking data can be filtered which ultimately leads to a new pathway. This is clearly demonstrated in the thirty years operations of the FDB which is now seen to be more commercially profit orientated in financing its overall development lending.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1007</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of novel nitrogen containing heterocycles</field><field name="creator">Yazici, Arife</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the development of new methods for the synthesis of functionalized pyrrolidines. These compounds are of important since they are the common ring structure that forms the bicyclic, heterocyclic core structure of the pyrrolizidine, indolizidine and Stemona alkaloids. In Chapter 2 we report our efforts to develop a general method for preparing 4- hydroxy-5-substituted pyrrolidin-2-ones from the borono-Mannich reactions of 4- hydroxy or 4-benzyloxy-5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-ones with boronic acids in the presence of BF3.Et2O. The 4,5-dihydroxypyrrolidin-2-one gave in two cases 4,5-cis adducts with very high cis selectivity but in relatively low yields, while the 4- benzyloxy-5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one gave 4,5-trans adducts with good trans selectivity and in good to moderate yields. Unfortunately the desired dienyl 4,5-cis adduct, required for the synthesis of the Stemona alkaloids, could only be obtained in the low yield of 33%. A RCM reaction of this compound gave the desired pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine in 72% yield. In Chapter 2 we also report the formation of a novel, Ritter reaction product, a pyrrolo[3,2-b]oxazole as an unwanted side product in the borono-Mannich reaction when acetonitrile was used as a solvent. In Chapter 3 we describe an efficient synthesis of pyrrolo[3,2-b]oxazoles from the Ritter reactions of 4-hydroxy or 4-benzyloxy-5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-ones with nitriles in the presence of BF3.Et2O. When 4-benzyloxy-5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one was used as the substrate the corresponding pyrrolo[3,2-b]oxazoles were formed along with the corresponding N-benzyl amides, which were formed from the Ritter reactions of benzyl cation and the nitrile. The isolation of these amide compounds were consistent with our proposed reaction mechanism. Two of the pyrrolo[3,2- d]oxazole compounds were hydrolyzed to novel 5-acylaminopyrrolidinones. In Chapter 4 we report the metal-catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 3- hydroxy-2-alkynylpyrrolidine which was obtained from the borono-Mannich reaction of 2,3-dihydroxypyrrolidine and potassium phenylethynyltrifluoroborate. The cycloisomerization reaction of this pyrrolidine afforded a 2,5-disubstituted furan when Ag(I), Au(I) or Pd(II)/Cu(I) were used as a catalyst. While 3-halo-2,5- disubstituted furans were synthesized from the corresponding CuCl or CuBr vi mediated reactions. Novel 3-iodo, 3-phenyl and 3-cyano susbstituted furo[3,2- b]pyrroles were synthesized from the reactions of the 3-hydroxy-2- alkynylpyrrolidine with CuI, CuCN and PhI/Pd(dba)2, respectively. In Chapter 5 a novel method for the synthesis of 3-cyanoindoles is reported. This method showed good tolerance to electron-donating and electron withdrawing substituents on the starting ortho-alkynylaniline and allowed 3-cyanoindoles to be obtained in a single step. While the method of Wang provides 3-bromo and 3-chloro indoles in one step from ortho-alkynylanilines this method has not been extended to make 3-cyanoindoles. Future studies could involve the examination of Wang`s conditions using CuCN/O2 instead of CuBr2 or CuCl2 to prepare 3-cyanoindoles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3087</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Few today appear to have heard of this man so the task of this research was to discover who he was, why he was chosen and how effective he was as a correspondent. The fact he had not been remembered hinted at two possibilities; the first was that as little attention has been given to New Zealand&#8217;s media history so he had become one of the forgotten and just awaited some eager historian to rediscover him or, secondly, he had been forgotten because he had not left a lasting legacy or tradition worthy of remembrance. It was a conundrum waiting to be solved and that was the purpose of the research. What was uncovered was a man, born of Scottish working class parents who by 52, when he was selected as official war correspondent, had reached what appeared to be the pinnacle of his career. He was successful, both financially and socially. He had been an exceptional mountaineer and sportsman. His journalism and photographic skills had made him one of the leading journalists of his day. Few were surprised when he was appointed as the country&#8217;s first official war correspondent. It is the contention of this thesis that from the time of his appointment, Ross&#8217;s reputation and status eroded to the extent that his final years after the war appeared to have been spent in relative obscurity. The reason for this will be explored and largely hinges on the almost overwhelming criticism Ross received for his efforts as war correspondent. A major part of the research was devoted to determining whether this criticism was fair and whether Ross warranted elevation into the ranks of the undeserved forgotten of our country&#8217;s media heroes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">War journalism</field><field name="subject">1st World War</field><field name="subject">Great War</field><field name="subject">Biography</field><field name="subject">War correspondents</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/979</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A simulation model of infant-incubator-feedback system with humidification and temperature control</field><field name="creator">Al-Taweel, Yasser Amer</field><field name="description">A comprehensive simulation model for the infant-incubator-feedback system was developed in a Matlab/Simulink&#174; environment to investigate all heat exchange relationships, variables and factors that have an influence on the overall thermo-neutrality of the environment.

The model incorporated all compartments of the infant-incubator system including core, skin, incubator air space, mattress, incubator walls, air-circulating fan, heating element, added oxygen (for resuscitation purposes), and humidification chamber, which has not previously been considered. The results of the simulation were in terms of the temperature variation over time, of the following parts of the system: core and skin temperatures and incubator air space temperature. Results of the simulation with added humidity showed that the body temperature of a 900 gram infant, with an initial body temperature of 35.5 &#186;C, did not reach the thermo-neutral range between 36.5-37.5 &#186;C in two hours, on air mode. Whereas, on skin mode, both core and skin temperature reached to 36.87 &#186;C and 36.5 &#186;C in two hours, and thus a thermo-neutral environment was achieved. These outcomes are consistent with clinical empirical reports. The simulation model is a closed-loop system with a PID controller for each mode; air servo controlled and skin servo controlled. The controller parameters were virtually estimated by the Zeigler-Nichols Method as real values were not available. Nevertheless, the overall stability of the whole system has been achieved by applying a step input which was verified by the Root Locus Method.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Simulation models</field><field name="subject">Infant incubator feedback systems</field><field name="subject">Temperature control</field><field name="subject">Sisotool Simulink</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/975</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a New Zealand version of the World Health Organisation of Quality of Life Survey (WHOQOL) instrument</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Patricia</field><field name="description">Research on health related Quality of Life (QoL) is valuable in developing health policy, assessing medical treatment outcomes and social sciences. Different QoL measurement instruments reflect different facets, and some QoL assessment tools are culturally insensitive. This study examines the existing WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organisation Quality of Life) 26-item instrument for its suitability for use in New Zealand studies. It focuses on seeking facets of QoL of particular importance to New Zealand culture upon which New Zealand national items may be constructed and included when using the WHOQOL-BREF in studies in New Zealand. In order to achieve this goal, the project involved four sub-studies: verifying the existing WHOQOL response scale descriptors; conducting focus groups to elicit new areas or facets of QoL peculiar and particular to New Zealanders; examining the stability of the WHOQOL-BREF importance scale test-retest reliability; and conducting a national survey to assess what facets of QoL are most important to New Zealanders upon which national items may be developed and the national importance survey. The verification of response scale showed good correspondence with the standard English WHOQOL version. A total of 46 candidate importance items were generated from 12 focus groups&#8217; discussions. Test/retest reliability revealed that the existing WHOQOL-Importance questionnaire items were more stable over a three week period, better than several of the new candidate importance items. Two thousand questionnaires asking what is important to New Zealand were sent out to the NZ general population and 585 returned. Results revealed that what is important varies across age, gender and health states. Twenty-four national items were developed from the national importance data. The study confirmed that what is considered as important facets of QoL varies within New Zealand and that there are facets that are important to New Zealanders not in the existing WHOQOL-BREF.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NZ QoL</field><field name="subject">Quality of Life</field><field name="subject">WHOQOL</field><field name="subject">NZWHOQOL</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/978</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working stories :</field><field name="creator">Adams, Kaye</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEd)--University of South Australia, 1997</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human services</field><field name="subject">Personnel management.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/84383</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43115</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of reinforced concrete columns in fire /</field><field name="creator">Adams, J C</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng)--University of South Australia, 1998</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Columns, Concrete</field><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82355</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43411</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray image analysis /</field><field name="creator">Abeynayake, H T G Canicious M</field><field name="description">Total hip replacement in acute femoral neck fractures is done in salvage situations such as non-union and aseptic necrosis.

GPCRs are cell surface receptors which have seven membrane spanning domains. They are the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and are involved in a number of physiological and pathophysiological pathways. They are the most widely targeted protein family for therapeutics being the target for over 30% of the currently available prescription drugs (Jacoby et al. 2006). For this reason commercial interest and investment into compound screening using these receptors as targets is of high importance in lead drug discovery. Additionally, the extensive ligand range of the GPCR superfamily, which includes light, odorants/ volatiles, neurotransmitters and hormones, make them an attractive biological recognition element in biosensor applications. This thesis demonstrates the functional expression of the H1-histamine, M2-muscarinic and &#945;&#8322;&#8336;-adrenergic receptors of the G-protein coupled receptor family, along with their associated G-proteins (G&#945;, G&#946; and G&#947;). Expression was achieved using the Sf9/baculovirus expression system. The G-proteins were successfully incorporated into an assay system using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TRFRET). TR-FRET was used in order to create a homogeneous assay format capable of monitoring GPCR activation through the movement of the G-protein subunits. Fluorescence changes in the TR-FRET assay indicated a change in distance between the G&#945; subunit and G&#946;&#947; dimer. The separation of the G&#945; subunit and the G&#946;&#947; dimer after activation resulted in a significant decrease in TR-FRET measurement. The homogeneous set-up of the TR-FRET assay could potentially be adaptable to an array based format. This thesis describes the capture of vesicles containing functional GPCRs onto a solid substrate via the specific interaction between complementary oligonucleotides. GPCR presence and function within the immobilized vesicles, was demonstrated using fluorescent ligands. Further to this, alternative lipid hosts (to the vesicles), known as cubosomes, were introduced. When tagged with an oligonucleotide, these cubosome particles were also shown to immobilize site specifically onto a complementary oligonucleotide surface.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">G-protein coupled receptors; TR-FRET; G-protein assay; membrane protein array; vesicles; oligonucleotide-directed immobilisation; cubosomes</field><field name="subject">G proteins Receptors.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59447</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of PpMDHARs and PpENA1 from the moss, Physcomitrella patens.</field><field name="creator">Drew, Damian Paul</field><field name="description">Identifying a genetic basis for the tolerance to salinity exhibited by the resilient moss, Physcomitrella patens, could provide valuable information for use in the selection or modification of salinity tolerance in crop plants. The overall aim of the work described in this thesis was to identify, express and functionally characterise the protein products of two putative salinity tolerance genes from Physcomitrella, namely PpMdhar and PpENA1. The characterisation of PpMdhar and PpENA1 represents a two-pronged approach into investigating the salinity tolerance of Physcomitrella at the biochemical and transport level, respectively. The enzymes encoded by PpMdhars, monodehydroascorbate reductases (MDHARs), are central to the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, and recycle monodehydroascorbate molecules into the antioxidant, ascorbate. Hence, MDHARs play a part in maintaining the capacity of plant cells to remove toxic reactive oxygen species. Given that the production of reactive oxygen species is greatly increased in plants under salt stress, and that Physcomitrella is tolerant of high salt, MDHAR enzymes were expressed to determine whether they exhibit increased enzymic activity when compared with MDHARs from higher plants. The protein encoded by PpENA1 is Na&#8314; transporting ATPase, which actively transports toxic Na&#8314; ions across the cell membranes, and thereby minimizes the level of Na&#8314; that accumulates in the cytoplasm. Thus, in contrast to the mechanism by which MDHARs may help Physcomitrella deal with the secondary effects of high salt, the PpENA1 protein could enable the moss to actively exclude Na&#8314; ions, and thereby avoid cellular toxicity. A link between salinity and the transcription of PpMdhar and PpENA1 is reported here, and the function of each gene is investigated. A comprehensive characterisation of the enzymic action of expressed PpMDHAR enzymes is described, demonstrating that the biochemical mechanisms used by Physcomitrella in dealing with salt-induced reactive oxygen species are likely to be conserved with vascular plants. The physiological effects of the expression of PpENA1 are investigated via complementation experiments in yeast, and the membrane location of the protein is determined. The Na&#8314; binding-sites of PpENA1 are predicted using homology modelling and amino acid residues crucial for Na&#8314; transport are tested experimentally via site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, the introduction of a new, functional Na&#8314; binding-site into an inactivated form of the PpENA1 protein demonstrates that a degree of control is possible over the Na&#8314; binding-sites in PpENA1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity tolerance; monodehydroascorbate; PpENA1; ATPase; physcomitrella</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59450</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday spirituality : supporting the spiritual experience of young children in three early childhood educational settings : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bone, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is the spiritual experience of young children in early childhood educational settings. Spirituality is included in the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, Te Whariki, but is a relatively unarticulated aspect of educational practice. In order to find out how spirituality is supported in early childhood educational contexts this qualitative case study research took place in three early childhood settings: a Montessori casa, a private preschool and a Steiner (Waldorf) kindergarten. The methods used in the research included participant observation, interviews and focus groups. The teachers were asked to make a video about spirituality to reflect their own context and photographs were taken in each setting. The metaphor of spiritual landscape is used in this research. In this landscape everyday experience merged with the spiritual to form the concept of everyday spirituality. The cultural theories of everyday life supported a realisation that ordinary daily activity can become wonderful and mysterious when the spiritual dimension is realised. The themes that emerged from analysis of the case studies are conceptualised as transformative aspects of learning and relationships. They are aspects of everyday spirituality identified as spiritual withness; spiritual inbetweenness; and the spiritually elsewhere. Representing spiritual experience is challenging. The thesis is written in narrative form and contains core narratives as prose and poems. Using writing as a means of discovery made communicating spirituality through the medium of words a possibility. Spirituality is proposed to be an inclusive concept that affirms a sense of connection and this thesis found that all pedagogical practices in early childhood settings have the potential to include a spiritual aspect. In Aotearoa New Zealand many children lead their everyday lives in the context of an early childhood environment that includes teachers and parents as part of that community. This thesis argues that when everyday spirituality permeates early childhood contexts that all aspects of the curriculum are realised and the spiritual experience of everyone connected to that setting is supported.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">spiritual landscape</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/623</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expectations, emerging issues and change for Chinese international students in a New Zealand university : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Skyrme, Gillian Ray</field><field name="description">This study uses a sociocultural framework to trace the experiences of 24 Chinese international undergraduate students studying business and information sciences in a New Zealand university, using community of practice perspectives recognising the university as a site of complex discourses requiring negotiation of new identities and practices. The students&#8217; expectations, the issues that emerged and the processes of change they went through to meet their goals were investigated from retrospective and longitudinal viewpoints, using semi-structured interviews supported by schematic representations developed by the researcher and photographic representations compiled by participants were. The findings suggest that preparation before departure focused largely on expected English demands, rather than wider matters of academic culture, and this was only partially rectified during prior study in New Zealand. Students thus entered the university unfamiliar with its specific discourses and found conditions for resolving difficulties more limited than previously experienced. The anonymity and extreme time pressure pertaining in large first-year classes led to bewilderment about requirements, threats to the sense of identity as competent students which they had arrived with, and often, failure of courses. Nevertheless, the investment, personal and monetary, which this journey represented provided the incentive to persevere. Most students were resourceful in negotiating a fit between their learning preferences and the affordances of the university, resulting in very different journeys for each of them. Measures adopted included those sanctioned by the university, such as developing skills to meet the demands of academic literacies, and others less valued, such as extreme dependence on teacher consultation. Success was gained through personal agency which proved more important than the university goal of student autonomy. Beyond the academic arena, other activities such as part-time jobs were significant in contributing to a sense of identity as competent and educated adults, and to new viewpoints which contrasted with original cultural norms. They continued to identify as Chinese, but in a &#8220;third space&#8221; owing something to New Zealand influences. The study concludes that entry criteria should include a component of university preparation. It also recommends measures by which the university might enhance the experiences of such students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese international students</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/793</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the acidic protein fraction of bovine whey and its effect on bone cells : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, New Zealand EMBARGOED till 1 December 2015</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Bernadette Jane</field><field name="description">Milk is provided to new borns as their first food source and it contains essential nutrients, vitamins and other beneficial components, such as enzymes and antibodies that are required for rapid growth and development of the new born and for sustained growth over time. Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction in Fluid Intelligence: Knowledge, novelty, learning and proactive interference</field><field name="creator">Bui, Myvan</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fluid intelligence</field><field name="subject">gf</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">proactive interference</field><field name="subject">novelty</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">hierarchical linear modelling</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">induction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prostitute and her community in late-medieval London</field><field name="creator">Norrie, Jasmine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationship between prostitute, law, and community in late-medieval London.

In arguing that the leaders of the union during that time allowed the pursuit of their particular ideological agendas to supplant the interests of the union's membership, it has been necessary to lay stress upon the peculiarity of the maritime workplace. This was a workplace that was not only occupied but inhabited by the merchant seaman. It is contended here that the special circumstances of the maritime workplace were such as to render seamen vulnerable to exploitation not only at the hands of their employers but also at the hands of their industrial leaders.It is shown here that for the membership of the Seamen's Union of Australasia the period 1918-1943 was one of division and convulsion. None of the leaders that this work considers in historical succession was able to rectify the prevaihng situation, regardless of their widely varying ideological agendas that ranged from Utopian socialism through anarchistic individualism to realpolitik It is argued that as a consequence of the breakdown of social polity within their industrial association, Australian merchant seamen were subjected to manipulation by forces that were beyond their power to control. Alienated from a landward society that was little aware of their special circumstances and that was generally unsympathetic, the seamen became an antagonised occupational group. Thus, by 1943, they were readily available for deployment in support of an ideology that was not of their making.This thesis necessitates consideration not only of the physical circumstances but of the psychological consequences of seafaring in the development of an attitude and subsequent behavioural patterns within the historical period under examination. It has also been necessary to take a number of contextual themes into consideration. Thus, shipping being crucial to the economic viability of the nation, maritime industrial relations routinely involved recourse to the coercive power of the state. And, since it was vital for Britain's economic interest to restrict competition in the operation of the liner link between the United Kingdom and Australasia, British 'shipping nationalism' had a dire effect upon the ere wing of Australian ships. Then there is the matter of the widening gap between the levels of skill reserved for and exercised by ships' deck and engineer officers and those of the seamen, as recognised in the anachronistically punitive disciplinary clauses of the Navigation Act. Yet another theme is the internationalism of seamen which while making them conscious of their advantages in comparison to other national seamen, also rendered them apprehensive of disadvantage. Australian seamen feared regression to the conditions endured by British national seamen. Worse still was their fear of supersession by those 'superexploited' Asian, African, and Indian seamen who under the terms of Asian articles sailed in many ships of Great Britain's merchant fleet, a situation that gave point to the factional power struggles which occurred within the body of the union.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The restructuring of the NSW coalmining industry, 1903-1982</field><field name="creator">Dingsdag, Donald Pierre</field><field name="description">The thesis is developed chronologically into nine chapters, the first two dealing with the 19th century and the remaining seven with the 20th century.

In this regard we identify a number of macroeconomic variables which played a major role in enhancing private investment in developing countries, and Iran in particular, between 1970 and 1993. An empirical investment model, a simultaneous investment model by industry and a macroeconomic model are applied to study the investment behaviour in this country. Lack of economic data, differences in economic structure, and different economic concepts between developed and developing countries, were the major issues that made this study more complicated.The adopted empirical investment model is based on the Blejer and Khan (1984) and the Greene and Villanueva (1990) approach, which are related to investment behaviour in developing countries. The model enables us to show the effects of public current and capital expenditure, funded by oil export revenue, on private investment and other macroeconomic factors. The simultaneous investment function for major economic activities, indicates that domestic investment was affected by output, capital stock, bank financing, oil exports and public investment rather than the official (fixed) or real exchange rate in the parallel market and/or interest rate. The Harvie and Kearney (1995) macroeconomic model is amended to study the crowding out, or crowding in, effects of public current and capital expenditure on private investment in developing countries, focusing upon Iran as a case study. This model also examines the effects of the interest rate, real exchange rate and world income on the behaviour of major macroeconomic variables in the product, money and asset markets, and especially private investment.The estimation results indicate that private investment was negatively affected by an increase in the interest rate, but positively by the major components of aggregate demand such as private consumption and public current and capital expenditure. These results also suggest that both public current and capital expenditure crowd in private investment.The simulation results suggest a number of alternative government policies for achieving economic development goals and enhancing private investment. The policies presented are: 1. A two tier interest rate policy should be administered by the government, a lower interest rate for investment purposes, accompanied with a higher interest rate for savings, term deposits and bank credits. 2. Allocation of a higher proportion of oil export revenues for public investment only in infrastructure fields and/or financing private investment. 3. Pursuing a unified floating exchange rate policy.The experience of billions of petro-dollars investment in various public enterprises in the 1970s, and nationalisation of hundreds of large scale private industries after the revolution, centralised the economy, aimed at pursuing the strategic goal of economic development. Eventually, however, the government also realised that the contribution of private investment was a prerequisite for sustainable economic development. This experience implied the need for a number of microeconomic reforms. Liberalisation of the economy including^ that of trade, privatisation of nationalised industries, reform of public enterprises, floating the exchange rate and the attraction of foreign direct investment are a concise summary of these essential microeconomic reforms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1310</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of Japanese technology transfer to Indonesia: a study of the effect of technology transfer on managerial skill formation of the host country's employees</field><field name="creator">Frinces, Zein Heflin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a result of an intensive empirical and exploratory field research conducted among Japanese subsidiaries operating in Indonesia based on case studies. This research studies the effect of Japanese technology transfer to Indonesia on the managerial skill formation of Indonesian employees.This thesis consists of 6 chapters. Chapter 1 contains background reasons for selecting the research topic and a "problem statement" of the research. Chapter 2 sets out the detailed stages of the way this study has been conducted. Chapter 3 provides a review of previous research that forms the basis for the research guidelines for the study. A pilot research or survey of 4 Japanese subsidiaries operating in Indonesia, was undertaken to test various theories found in existing literatures and to formulate further courses of action for this study. Further research was carried out involving 16 Japanese subsidiaries and 21 Indonesian managerial staff working in the Japanese subsidiaries operating in Indonesia.The review of previous studies in Chapter 3 suggested that there had been very little research on the subject of the effect of technology transfer on managerial skill formation. There had been little research on this subject because, as the review suggests it was perceived that skills had been formed in an automatic fashion and that management could operate smoothly without being concerned much about skill formation. It was also believed that research on the issues was both theoretically and empirically quite difficult to carry out. In this research the types of managerial skills studied are divided into three components, namely, (1) Japanese specific managerial skills, (2) functional or professional managerial skills, and (3) general managerial skills, consisting of conceptual, human, and technical skills. The Indonesian managerial staff working in Japanese subsidiaries were expected to have acquired these skills. It was predicted that the effect of technology transfer on skill formation and the acquisition of these skills, were associated with the various moderating factors explained in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 contains detailed case studies which give insight into both the skill formation process and the effects of of various moderating variables on the transfer process. Chapter 5 presents various findings of the study and analyses of the findings. It was found that only three of the five moderating variables studied had a significant impact on the skills formation process. On the basis of existing theories and this study's empirical evidence, a model of technology transfer and skill formation was then developed and presented in Chapter 5.

It does so by assessing how the Western news media framed reporting of Indonesian political leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri between 1998 and 1999: a period encompassing the end of the Suharto New Order and the election of the Wahid- Sukarnoputri government. Public knowledge is conceptualised as the way audiences broadly think about and structure their ideas, feelings, fears, and beliefs about political actors. The objective is to demonstrate that framing is universal and inescapable, and often to the determinant of the public sphere.This thesis argues that the Western news media broadly framed Indonesia in the late stages of the 1990s as in &#8216;crisis&#8217;, in itself this is perhaps surprising. The Western media has a propensity to report the Third world as in perpetual political crisis, bordering at times on anarchy. In this case, it is argued that by framing Indonesia in crisis a &#8216;social reality&#8217; emerged that &#8216;named&#8217; certain &#8216;truths&#8217; about Indonesian politics and its leaders. It hypothesises that embedded in this social reality, the New Order (Suharto and later Habibie) were framed as responsible for the state of economic and political crises and were judged as morally and politically unable to solve the problems being experienced in Indonesia. Captured within this &#8216;reality&#8217; was a set of privileged meanings that imagined a Megawati presidency as the remedy and solution. Whether a future Megawati presidency was an advantage or disadvantage to Indonesia is not the scope of this study, rather it demonstrates how framing functioned to assemble emotional and political meaning about Megawati and her values, character and motivations during 1998-1999.In examining how episodic, crisis and issue framing shaped social realities about Indonesia and its political leadership, this study also argues that frames reflected Western assumptions about Indonesia but more so about gendered post-colonial leadership. As a result, the frames produced in this period were stereotypical, oversimplified, decontextualised, reliant on the juxtapositioning of actors in binaries of &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;evil&#8217; and reflective of mediatised rituals of drama, tragedy and emotion. This resulted in the production of public knowledge about Indonesia generally, and Megawati specifically, that was discursive.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3088</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organizational Adaptation and Resilience to Extreme Weather Events</field><field name="creator">Martina Linnenluecke</field><field name="description">Impacts from climate change already pose major challenges for organizations and industrial systems, and vulnerabilities are expected to increase in the future, particularly in vulnerable sectors and locations. Findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that climate change related vulnerabilities of organizations and industries, but also of settlement and society as a whole, are mainly related to changes in the intensity and/or frequency of extreme weather, rather than to gradual climate change impacts. Organization researchers and managers, however, have not yet systematically considered the organizational implications of changes in trends of weather extremes, such as changes to the intensity and/or frequency of storms, floods, and droughts. While companies in the reinsurance industry (e.g., Munich Re, Swiss Re) have begun to undertake research into changes in trends of extremes, most current debates on climate change and corporate response are mainly focused on adaptation &#8211; that is, longer-term adjustments that organizations can take in response to policy and legislative changes and the observed gradual warming trend. The question of how organizations can cope with more frequent and/or intense weather extremes has largely remained outside of these debates. The thesis advances the notion that the resilience concept which originated in disciplines such as ecology and engineering may provide insights into dealing with new types of environmental change arising from changes in patterns of weather extremes. It emphasizes that organizational adaptation and resilience potentials are context-specific and related to the characteristics of particular climate change impacts. While organizations may be able to undergo steady adaptations to gradual climate change (such as gradual increases in mean temperatures), they might not be able to handle disruptions that go beyond this gradual trend and are related to changes in extremes. Included in this thesis are five papers that seek to provide a foundation for understanding, assessing and evaluating organizational responses to more frequent and/or intense weather extremes. The first paper serves as an introduction to the thesis, assesses the literatures on organizational adaptation and resilience, and proposes an initial model that draws together the different streams of literature on climate change, adaptation and resilience. The second paper extends on the themes of the first paper and provides a discussion of the concepts of adaptation and resilience, as well as their applicability to different types of climate change impacts. The third paper serves as a method paper and discusses assessment methods and pathway to study organizational resilience. The key difficulties identified in this paper are the uncertainties about future climate change outcomes across temporal and spatial scales and a lack of insight into what leads to organizational resilience, or which variables should be measured in a given study. The fourth paper is an empirical study about the 2009 Victorian Bushfires. While individual extreme events cannot be directly linked to climate change impacts, this study highlights that part of the problem in drawing out the resilience of organizations to an unprecedented and &#8216;more-severe-than-expected&#8217; extreme event is that a range of contingent variables across organizational and societal and ecological levels are potentially relevant. The last paper discusses the potential inability of organization to adjust to changes in climate and weather, and implications in terms of a necessity of a geographical shift of organizational and industrial activities. The thesis highlights gaps in our understanding of organizational challenges and suggests avenues for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational adaptation</field><field name="subject">organizational resilience</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">global warming</field><field name="subject">extreme weather events</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201230</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Defining Sets in Latin Squares and two Intersection Problems, one for Latin Squares and one for Steiner Triple Systems</field><field name="creator">Thomas Mccourt</field><field name="description">Consider distinct latin squares, L and M, of order n. Then the pair (T1, T2) where T1 = L \M and T2 = M \ L is called a latin bitrade. Furthermore T1 and T2 are referred to as latin trades, in which T2 is said to be a disjoint mate of T1 (and vice versa). Dr&#225;pal (1991) showed that, under certain conditions, a partition of an equilateral triangle of side length n, where n is some integer, into smaller, integer length sided equilateral triangles gives rise to a latin trade within the latin square based on the addition table for the integers modulo n. A partial latin square P of order n is said to be completable if there exists a latin square L of order n such that P &#8838; L. If there is only one such possible latin square, L, of order n then P is said to be uniquely completable and P is called a defining set of L. Furthermore, if C is a uniquely completable partial latin square such that no proper subset of C is uniquely completable, C is said to be a critical set or a minimal defining set. These concepts, namely latin trades and defining sets in latin squares, are intimately connected by the following observation. If L is a latin square and D &#8838; L is a defining set, then D intersects all latin bitrades for which one mate is contained in L. In Part I of this thesis Dr&#180;apal&#8217;s result is applied to investigate the structure of certain defining sets in latin squares. The results that are obtained are interesting in themselves; furthermore, the geometric approach to the problem yields additional appealing results. These geometric results are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6. They pertain to partitioning regions (polygons in R2 that satisfy certain obvious conditions) into equilateral, integer length sided, triangles, such that no point, in the region, is a corner of more than three distinct triangles. In Chapter 2 one of the main two theorems on defining sets is established, as is a method for using the above geometric results to prove the nonexistence of certain types of defining sets. In Part II of this thesis, intersection problems, for latin squares and Steiner triple systems, are considered. The seminal works, for problems of these types, are due to Lindner and Rosa (1975) and Fu (1980). A natural progression, from the established literature, for intersection problems between elements in a pair of latin squares or Steiner triple systems is to problems in which the intersection is composed of a number of disjoint configurations (isomorphic copies of some specified partial triple system). In this thesis solutions to two intersection problems for disjoint configurations are detailed. An m-flower, (F,F), is a partial triple system/configuration, such that: F = {{x, yi, zi} | {yi, zi} &#8745; {yj , zj} = &#8709;, for 0 &#8804; i, j &#8804; m &#8722; 1, i 6= j}; and F = UX&#8712;FX. The first such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k and m &#8805; 2 such that a pair of latin squares of order n exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint m-flowers. The necessary terminology, constructions, lemmas and proof for this result are contained in Chapters 7, 8 and 9. The second such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k such that a pair of Steiner triple systems of order u exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint 2-flowers. This result relies on the solution to the latin square problem and an additional result from Chapter 9. The further constructions and lemmas used to prove this result are detailed in Chapter 10.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">latin trade</field><field name="subject">latin bitrade</field><field name="subject">triangulation</field><field name="subject">defining set</field><field name="subject">critical set</field><field name="subject">partial triple system</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple system</field><field name="subject">intersection problem</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation, transportation and engineering of entanglement between two separate qubit systems</field><field name="creator">Sze-liang Chan</field><field name="description">Quantum entanglement is widely renounced as one of the most fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics. Such phenomenon exhibit non-local interaction properties which cannot be explained classically. In this thesis, we address a number of problems associated with creating, transferring and engineering of entanglement between two separate parties. The work is motivated by a desire to better understand the dynamics of entanglement between systems. In particular, the research is mainly focused on the study of the dynamics of the well known maximally entangled Bell state under different in&#64258;uences such as decoherence and inter-qubit coupling. We show the connection between coherence and entanglement using the system sub jected to decoherence. We also con&#64257;rm the transfer of entanglement between completely isolated partite using the double Jaynes-Cummings model. Based on this result, we propose a new conservation criterion proven to be general for single excitation systems. Such conservation criterion are then compared and extended to a general N qubit systems. In addition, an attempt is made to evaluate entanglement conservation rules for the EPR- like multipartite entanglement.

However, synthetic vaccines have significant limitations including poor immunogenicity and fast degradation, necessitating co-administration with effective adjuvants and use of appropriate delivery systems. Current choices of effective and safe adjuvants and delivery systems are very limited, and formulations/conjugations of synthetic vaccines often do not lead to clinical success. Rational design and novel synthetic methods are in high demand to overcome obstacles in synthetic vaccine development. In this PhD research project, new antigen delivery platforms (lipopeptide-carbohydrate-antigen platforms) were developed by integrating a lipopeptide and a topology-controlling template to present and deliver synthetic antigens, which may serve as a generic strategy to develop safe and effective synthetic vaccines. The focus of this research was on the rational design and optimized chemical synthesis of the platforms. The design of the lipopeptide-carbohydrate-antigen platforms was inspired by the principle of self-adjuvanting lipopeptide vaccines that feature the covalent attachment of bacterial or synthetic lipids to peptide antigens. Lipopeptide vaccines have generally shown a good safety profile in human clinical trials and seen as a potential approach for human vaccination. The lipopeptide [C12-G-C12-C12-G; G: glycine; C12: 2-(R/S)-aminododecanoic acid] used in this study was derived from the lipid core peptide (LCP) system which has demonstrated high delivery capacity and synthetic flexibility in numerous applications. Aiming to introduce the topology-controlling feature to self-adjuvanting lipopeptide vaccines, this study introduced topological templates (carbohydrates) to the platforms, based on the concept of template assembled synthetic peptide (TASP) that has emerged as a de novo strategy to assemble peptides in a desired conformation. Five carbohydrate templates that varied in conformation and spacer were used in the platform design, providing an opportunity to optimize the antigen&#8217;s spatial arrangement. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop antigen delivery platforms which can be used for human vaccines. Therefore, optimized methods for the synthesis of the platforms were developed to achieve high purity and good yield of the final products. Two series of carbohydrate templates were first synthesized, with functional groups suitable for covalent conjugation to the lipopeptide moiety and multiple peptide antigens. The spatial conjugation positions and the length of the spacers of these templates were varied through modifications to the hydroxyl groups of glucose, galactose and mannose. To achieve an efficient conjugation of the sugar molecules and the peptides (lipopeptide and peptide antigens), techniques that were examined included solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and native chemical ligation (NCL). The attempts using SPPS did not yield the target product when incorporating a model antigen (20-mer peptide epitope 8830; DNGKAIYERARERALQELGP; derived from group A streptococcal M protein) to a glucose-based template because of significant difficulties including low coupling efficiency and unsuccessful purification. In contrast, a series of lipopeptide-carbohydrate-8830 products were synthesized in high purity and good yield using NCL, after the solubility problem had been solved. The poor water solubility of the lipopeptide-carbohydrate constructs was significantly improved through co-lyophilization of the compounds with 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate. Conformational studies of the synthesized vaccine candidates containing 8830 were performed using circular dichroism (CD). The data revealed that the attached antigenic peptides formed &#945;-helix bundles in all cases. The result is in line with the common &#945;-helix-inducing feature of carbohydrate templates. This approach was extended to incorporate synthetic J14i (14-mer peptide epitope; ASREAKKQVEKALE; derived from group A streptococcal M protein) in an effort to induce its &#945;-helicity. Embedding this minimal epitope in helix-promoting peptide sequences was previously developed in literature to mimic J14i&#8217;s helical structure at the corresponding site of the native protein. However, the introduction of &#8220;foreign&#8221; peptide sequences is believed to have an unfavourable impact on the antigen specificity. This work employed a non-peptide approach, using the developed topological carbohydrate templates, to induce helical conformation of the peptide antigen. CD studies confirmed that the template-assembled peptide J14i formed &#945;-helix bundles. This strategy also reduces the complexity and cost of vaccine production by simply reducing the peptide size. Preliminary immunological evaluation demonstrated antigen-specific immune responses elicited by the synthesized vaccine candidates containing 8830, with vaccines based on different carbohydrate templates exhibiting varied efficacy. This data suggested that the different spatial structure of the vaccine candidates had key influence on the vaccine efficacy, pointing out the future direction of customizing carbohydrate templates for specific antigens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lipopeptide caccine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205574</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management in Malaysian five star hotels: Human resource practices system differentiation and its outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rozila Ahmad</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis explores the management of human resources (HR) in five star hotels located in a developing country (Malaysia). This study is particularly relevant to the hotel industry, known for its traditionally poor HR practices (e.g., a lack of employment security, training, and career development opportunity, low levels of employee involvement and an increasing number of casual employees who are paid hourly). These practices are often perceived as a solution to high labour costs and fluctuating demand prevalent in the hotel industry. However, it is often only "non-managerial" employees who are affected by poor HR practices, as more sophisticated approaches to HR practices are often taken with regard to managerial (strategic) level employees. HR practices system differentiation (HRPSD), or HR architecture, involves having more than one HR practices system within an organisation. HRPSD has been criticised in the hospitality management literature for the poor HR practices in the management of non-managerial employees, however despite this criticism, it is widely practiced by the industry. The continuation of HRPSD practices in the hotel industry suggests its importance to better understand, research and study. The aim of this research is to gain an understanding of HRPSD in a hotel industry context, and to better understand the immediate effects of such practices. While the existing literature concerning HR architecture in other industries provides some discussion of HRPSD, research and study of the concept focusing on the hotel industry is essential in providing a detailed explanation of the effect of this phenomenon, as HR practices between industries may vary. Central to this study, is an investigation of the nature of HRPSD, identification of HR intermediate outcomes, and the effects of HRPSD on hotel employees. Studying the effect of HRPSD on employees is important because employees are known to be a hotel organisations&#8223; most important resource. Developed based on the literature of SHRM and HR architecture, this study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates HRPSD in the SHRM model originally proposed by Schuler, Dowling, Smart, and Huber (1992). Guided by this model, this study seeks to answer the critical questions of &#8220;how organisations differentiate their HR practices systems&#8221; and &#8220;what are the corresponding HR intermediate outcomes?&#8221; A particular foci of this thesis relates to how the concept of a &#8220;strategic&#8221; (or managerial) job is conceptualised in the hotel industry, what the elements of HR practices systems in five-star hotels are, how and why hotel organisations differentiate their HR practices systems, what the HR intermediate outcomes of HRPSD are and how HRPSD relates to the identified HR intermediate outcomes. To answer these complex research issues, a multiple case research methodology is employed, utilising a series of in depth semi-structured interviews. This vi study focuses specifically on five-star hotels in Malaysia because HR practices vary among hotels of various sizes. The findings indicate a notable effect of HRPSD on employees&#8223; motivation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and retention, and that excessive differentiation is not beneficial for a five star hotel. In this study only certain HR practices were found to be differentiated; selective staffing, extensive training, compensation and empowerment. HR practices that were applied to all employees without differentiation were a clear job description, orientation, employment security, objective performance appraisal, career development opportunity and effective communication. In addition, this study also provides a clear definition of the strategic job in the hotel industry, and demonstrates the importance of HR practices integration and the influence of internal and external environments on the formation of HR strategy. This research contributes to theory as well as hotel sector policy and practice. Theoretically, it has identified how HRPSD links to firm performance (in Malaysian five star hotels). In addition, it provides clear definitions and understanding of the strategic job concept as well as identification of HR practices system elements and their differentiation in five-star hotels. Furthermore, the theoretical framework developed can be useful for future quantitative studies which can test the model formulated in this study. For practitioners, the detailed examination of HR practices system elements and how they are differentiated may guide them in their future HR strategy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel, strategy, human resource management, practices system, differentiation, intermediate outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205690</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Space and Performance of Virtual Reality</field><field name="creator">Neal Harvey</field><field name="description">In this dissertation&#8217;s study of virtual reality (VR), I focus my attention on two prominent types of VR: real virtualities and virtual realities. I argue that both are composed of performative acts of spatial production and that through the study of those acts, researchers can isolate and describe the difference between these two tropes of virtual reality. My thesis focuses on Henri Lefebvre&#8217;s theorisation of social space as the most detailed and appropriate spatial theory for such a process while Victor Turner&#8217;s liminal theory of social and ritual performance provides the necessary performative methodology to complement Lefebvre&#8217;s. My use of these theories allows researchers to identify the difference between social spaces that produce new spaces and practices, and those which reinforce the spatial paradigm that generated them. The process of identifying these differences further clarifies Lefebvre&#8217;s complicated description of social space, but it also provides a platform for researchers to distinguish between the two different types of virtual reality. Through a detailed examination of three ostensibly different examples of VR, I argue that virtual realities ought to be considered primarily as realities made virtual while real virtualities should be discussed as virtualities made real. In doing so this thesis advances the study and application of Lefebvrean thought whilst opening up new directions for virtuality studies. I have chosen to explore three case studies that, through their difference, foreground their spatial and performative nature. By focusing on distinctly different and atypical case studies, I highlight the methodology described in this project and its suitability (or otherwise) for discussing VR. Focusing firstly on Google, I explore the virtual reality of the World Wide Web, perhaps the most ubiquitous example of a virtual reality. The sheer pervasiveness, uptake and constant evolution of the World Wide Web means that it requires constant academic attention. Google is the page through which a staggering 53.3% of Web users access the Internet and to say that most people are actually browsing Google&#8217;s web instead of the actual web is by no means an under statement. Google, like all other search engines, has its own formula for determining results and rankings for search queries. Google is not, as many people would like to think, an objective map of the Internet. It relies so heavily on users&#8217; data in relation to their search query (which pages they click on, how long they spend there, whether they click back) that apart from the virtual algorithms that it uses to articulate the process Google could be said to be constituted solely by the real world practices of its users. Secondly I explore an example of the other type of VR, a real virtuality. Though the Gothic cathedral may not traditionally fall under the rubric of virtuality studies, the building itself provides an excellent example of the interaction of space and performance required to bring into existence that which was not there before. The Gothic cathedral is a concrete resolution of the actual/virtual dialectic and provides a unique opportunity to test my methodology&#8217;s ability to describe both types of VR and highlight the distinction between them. Whereas much of what constitutes virtuality studies centres on what I am calling the virtualisation of reality (online chat rooms, virtual banking, etc) &#8211; spaces that represent virtual others of real world entities, the Gothic cathedral represents the reverse of this: the realisation of a virtuality. The Gothic cathedral is unique in the context of this thesis for it is first and foremost a physical building rather than an onscreen other. It is a real virtuality in this thesis because, while concrete, there are some aspects of its reality that remain essential rather than formal and are dependent upon parishioners&#8217; performance in order to be made &#8216;real.&#8217; The final case study of this project represents the future usefulness of my methodology. In following up the work on exploring the suitability of describing a Gothic cathedral alongside Google, the last chapter of my dissertation explores the suitability of describing theatrical space as a VR. Similar to the Google chapter, this chapter focuses on a digital VR tool recently developed by Joanne Tompkins at the University of Queensland called the Online Theatre Project. The Online Theatre Project (OTP) represents a unique approach to the documentation, digital conceptualisation and archival problems that present themselves to a working theatre company in its everyday practice. The OTP is a server-based modeling and archival tool that allows users to draw, model and design their theatre production in real-time and then house their data on a remotely accessible server. Any notional description of theatrical space is necessarily a slippery one, given the relative youth of such studies and this project positions itself in this ever evolving debate by suggesting that the Online Theatre Project actually provides a description of what theatrical space entails where others have not. This thesis argues that VR space is dependent upon a constant spatial and performative production process. It illustrates how Lefebvre&#8217;s conceptualisation of the production process is most suitable for describing that production process and argues that re-imagining Lefebvre&#8217;s definition with the assistance of Turner&#8217;s everyday performative theory of liminality affords researchers the chance to differentiate between real virtualities and virtual realities. In doing so this thesis advances the study of VR, by proving that it is possible to discuss such complicated subjects in spatial and performative terms instead of the dominant real or un-real ones. Further, I outline the necessary adaptation of Lefebvre&#8217;s spatial triad that can be undertaken to prove its usefulness in many other aspects of VR studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">space, performance, virtual reality, Lefebvre, theatre, Google, gothic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206167</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Effects of Nanoparticle Dispersion on Physical and Mechanical Properties of HA/PHBV Nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Wadcharawadee Noohom</field><field name="description">This thesis is inspired by a persistent limitation in the use of composite biomaterials for orthopaedic applications, namely the agglomeration of reinforcing particles in these composites, which has resulted in poor mechanical properties. The use of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to produce biodegradable nanocomposites is investigated. More specifically, the thesis investigates different methods of composite processing, and interfacial modifying agents and the effect that these have on the nano- and micro- scale structure of composites and their mechanical properties. PHBV and HA were chosen because PHBV is a biodegradable/biocompatible polymer and it has a relatively high stiffness when compared to other biodegradable polymers frequently used in orthopaedic applications. HA is chemically similar to ceramic phase found in bones and hard tissues and the inclusion of HA into biomedical materials has been shown to enhance the rate of osteoconduction. HA/PHBV composites were produced using different dispersing agents including poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), a model dispersing agent, polyethyleneimine (PEI) which allowed for the development of a single solvent system for composite preparation, and heparin (Hep), a macromolecule which is produced in vivo. Additionally, HA/PAA/PHBV composites were prepared from both sonicated and non-sonicated HA/PAA suspensions up to approximately 17% by weight (wt %) of HA content. Attempts to prepare composites with higher HA loadings led to inhomogeneous composite mixtures, which were caused by the dual solvent system used for the composite preparation. The HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites were produced up to approximately 75 wt % of HA content. It was found that the HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites could be prepared at higher loadings than HA/PAA/PHBV composites due to the single solvent system used for the preparation of the HA/PEI/PHBV composites and the better dispersion of HA/Hep particles in precursor suspensions. Finally, selected HA/PEI/PHBV composites were further processed using a twin screw extruder. All of the composites were characterised in terms of their dispersion levels as well as their compressive mechanical properties. In addition, HA/PEI/PHBV composite reinforced with 20 wt % of HA content was also tested for its mechanical properties using three different test types; compression, three-point bending, and tensile tests. Finally, the HA/PAA/PHBV, HA/PEI/PHBV, and HA/Hep/PHBV composites were tested their compressive mechanical properties in wet state. It was found that the sonicated HA/PAA suspensions in general had better colloidal stability than non-sonicated ones and that this yielded composites with superior compressive moduli than those prepared from non-sonicated suspensions. In addition, the better dispersion of the particles in the composites prepared from the sonicated suspensions, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images, led to higher percentage crystallinities when compared to the composites prepared from non-sonicated suspensions. It is likely that the greater number of individual HA particles and smaller HA agglomerates observed in the composites prepared from sonication treatment are acting as nuclei for crystal growth more effectively than large HA agglomerates. The largest modulus and yield strength that could be achieved with this system were approximately 1.45 GPa and 80 MPa, respectively. Composites of HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV with approximately 55 wt % of HA content were found to exhibit the largest compressive moduli of approximately 2.5 and 2.8 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the yield strengths for the same materials were found to be approximately 123 and 120 MPa, respectively. This was found to correlate with the better levels of dispersion within the nanocomposites that could be achieved using these stabilisers. The extruded samples were found to have an even greater degree of particle dispersion when compared to the unextruded ones. This improved degree of particle dispersion of the extruded samples resulted in higher moduli in comparison to unextruded samples. The largest compressive modulus and yield strength of the extruded samples were found to be approximately 3.2 GPa and 125 MPa, respectively. The compressive moduli of the composites produced in this thesis are significantly greater than that of cancellous bone (0.4 GPa), but significantly lower than that of cortical bone (12.8&#8211;17.7 GPa). However, maximum yield strengths of the HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites match to cortical bone (120&#8211;180 MPa), which is a noteworthy finding in this thesis. The wet mechanical results of all composites as well as pure PHBV polymer showed a reduction in both moduli and yield strengths when compared to dry state. In addition, after 2 weeks in wet state both moduli and yield strengths of the composites and pure polymer converged to approximately the same values. Finally, the HA/PEI/PHBV composite samples tested by tensile testing showed the highest Young&#8217;s modulus and those tested by compression testing possessed the lowest Young&#8217;s modulus. This resulted from the difference in periods of time for heating exposure and void contents of the tested samples, which were prepared by different methods. However, toughness values obtained from the samples tested using three-point bending and tensile tests, was not significantly different.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydroxyapatite, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), composites, nano-sized, dispersion, mechanical properties, Young&#8217;s modulus, strength, crystallinities, bone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206173</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroacoustic Music With Moving Images: A Practice-Led Research Project</field><field name="creator">John Coulter</field><field name="description">The folio of compositions and critical commentary documents a major practice-led research project that was carried out from 2003-09 on the topic of &#8216;electroacoustic music with moving images&#8217;. The written report analyses and expands on the creative works by supplying detailed information concerning the &#8216;process&#8217; of composing for the genre, and the &#8216;language&#8217; of audiovisual media pairing. Sixteen extracts of creative work featuring specific qualities of language are also provided as a means of focussing discussion points. The folio of compositions is comprised of four creative works: Shifting Ground (2005), Mouth Piece (2008), Abide With Me (2009), and Eyepiece (2009), which present a one-hour audiovisual programme. The series was premiered in a special concert Seeing With Ears: Video Works By John Coulter as part of the proceedings of the New Zealand Electroacoustic Music Symposium (NZEMS) 2-4 September 2009, School of Music, University of Auckland, New Zealand. Part 1 of the thesis seeks to illuminate a general process of creative practice that is relevant to all forms of studio-based composition. Three frameworks are examined: those that contain singular creative tasks, those that contain multiple tasks, and those that contain multiple creative projects. A 3-tiered model of reflective practice is then offered, and procedures common to all electroacoustic composers are discussed. The action research paradigm is then presented, followed by domain-specific guidelines for undertaking research. Key differences between &#8216;composing&#8217; and &#8216;researching&#8217; are examined, and principles of conducting practice and research simultaneously are submitted. For those working in studio-based settings, the study provides a model, and a vocabulary for discussing his/her creative process, as well as procedural guidelines for contributing to expert domain knowledge through practice-led research. Part 2 of the thesis directly addresses a common paradox faced by composers working with sounds and moving images. On one hand, audiovisual materials appear to offer the possibility of complementing one another - of forming a highly effective means of communicating artistic ideas, and on the other, they appear to carry the risk of detracting from one another &#8211; of deforming the musical language that he/she has worked so hard to create. The study seeks to transcend this paradox through the identification of audiovisual materials that function in different ways. Examples of creative work are offered to illustrate more general points of language, a model for classifying media pairs is put forward, and practical methods of audiovisual composition are proposed. The narrow findings of the study offer a vocabulary for discussing the functionality of audiovisual materials, detailed methods of media pairing and techniques of parametric alignment, while the wider findings extend to associated domains such as live electronic music, and hyper-instrument design. In summary, the study recognises both creative works and written works as knowledge-bearing documents. Succinctly stated, the essential research findings are presented and supported by both phenomenological and nominal means - through aspects of creative works that make themselves apparent during the listening process, and through retrospective logical enquiry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">acousmatic, attention, concomitant, electroacoustic, isomorphic, parametric, synchresis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the biological control program of groundsel bush (Baccharis halimifolia L. Asteraceae)</field><field name="creator">Nichole Sims-chilton</field><field name="description">Invasive plants have a significant detrimental effect on ecosystems globally, with impacts estimated at millions of dollars per invasive species each year. Biological control has long been used as a management tool for invasive plants, as it is considered a long&#8211;term cost&#8211;effective control strategy. Surprisingly, the impact of biological agents is rarely quantified. Any form of impact evaluation is generally conducted soon after agent release and establishment; with few studies examining the impact of the agents on the population dynamics of the invader, particularly once the agents have been established for a long time. The aim of the research in my thesis is to evaluate the biological control program of groundsel bush (Baccharis halimifolia L. Asteraceae) in Australia. The groundsel bush biological control agents were released up to 40 years ago and no quantitative assessment of agent impact has ever been conducted, despite the fact that the program has cost about $9.6 million. More specifically, the overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the impact of the released biological control agents on individual plants and populations of groundsel bush. In addition, my thesis aims to examine the impacts of climate as a potential confounding factor of the biological control program. My thesis provides a unique example of biological control evaluation by using a combination of observational damage studies, insect exclusion experiments, and statistical, population and climate modelling to assess, a posteriori, the effectiveness of biological control. This is the first time a long term biological control program has ever been evaluated. To assess the efficacy of the agents, I conducted a large field survey to examine whether the agents were distributed throughout the entire range of groundsel bush and if any biotic or abiotic factors influenced their effectiveness. In addition to this, I assessed the effect of the agents on the growth, survival and fecundity of individual plants under field conditions, and subsequently population growth rate. To do this, I used statistical models of observed effects of biological control agent damage and insect exclusion experiments on plant growth and fecundity to parameterise matrix population models. My results indicate that the groundsel bush biological control agents may be patchy in their effectiveness due to factors such as rainfall and plant size. At their current rate of damage, the groundsel bush biological control agents do not reduce plant growth or fecundity significantly. However, simulation models demonstrated that the agents have the potential to reduce individual plant and population growth when damage is at high levels. A reduction in an invader&#8217;s population growth rate, following the introduction of biological control agents, does not necessarily signify that the agents were responsible for the reduction. Factors such as land clearing, chemical and mechanical control, ecosystem health and climate may reduce populations of invasive plant species. With this in mind, I developed a series of climate models to examine how the favourability for growth of groundsel bush may change under different climate scenarios. The climate simulations demonstrated that the distribution and abundance of groundsel bush populations may have contracted in the past 50 years (post&#8211;biological control agent release) due to changing rainfall and temperature patterns. The results of the research in my thesis clearly show the need for thorough biological control evaluations, and for detailed data to be collected on the target plant&#8217;s demography and population sizes pre- and post-agent release. At a minimum, this should enable biological control practitioners to determine some level of agent impact and demonstrate support for further agent releases or integrative management strategies if necessary. Groundsel bush is a significant invader in Europe where biological control has not yet been carried out. Lessons from the evaluation of the Australian biological control program could be applied to new biological control programs elsewhere such as Europe. Overall, my research findings contribute to a better understanding of how to best evaluate a post-release biological control program, using groundsel bush as a case study. This is the first study to demonstrate an effective set of strategies and quantitative tools to evaluate a biological control program, which can be similarly applied to any biological control program and contributes significantly to an area of biological control which has only recently received significant attention.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Baccharis halimifolia</field><field name="subject">Biological Control</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">CLIMEX</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">groundsel bush</field><field name="subject">matrix models</field><field name="subject">statistical models</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206180</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Internet in the Lives of People with Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Egan</field><field name="description">Psychosocial factors represent complex and enduring challenges for people with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), their families and health and rehabilitation systems, particularly in relation to social isolation, change/loss of role and identity issues. Traditional rehabilitation approaches to psychosocial issues target cognitive rehabilitation and psychological adjustment of the individual with a TBI, which reflect the medical model of health. However, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) ushers a new era in TBI research and practice, which advances the conceptualisation of disability, to include the impact of environmental factors. The ICF identifies the Internet as one such environmental factor, which has the potential to facilitate or impede social participation of people with a disability. Empirical studies suggest the potential of the Internet to empower people with disabilities, via opportunities for social connection; social support; social role participation and identity experimentation. However, research has focused on people with sensory, physical, and mental health issues, with little known of the potential of the Internet for people with a TBI. This area of deficit warrants investigation, in view of the potential of the Internet to address many dimensions of psychosocial concern following TBI. This study explores the role of the Internet in the lives of people with a TBI, with a focus on the potential of the Internet to influence psychosocial recovery. Psychosocial recovery is conceptualised as the reconstruction of a positive identity, as found in subjective accounts of people with a TBI (Lewington, 1996), and strongly supported in the mental health consumer literature. Using a social constructionist approach, this study explores how people with a TBI use the Internet and how they make meaning of their Internet experience. This approach acknowledges the socially situated nature of Internet use and validates the subjective accounts of people with a TBI, whose perspectives are underrepresented in the rehabilitation literature. This study also trials the method of email-facilitated qualitative interviewing, to address face-to-face interviewing barriers, relating to cognitive-linguistic impairments (Lloyd, Gatherer, &amp; Kalsy, 2006; Paterson &amp; Scott-Findley, 2002). Thus, the Internet is the focus of the enquiry and the mediator of the method. The findings highlight the positive potential of the Internet to facilitate social participation for people with a TBI. Participants reported that features such as asynchronicity, reduced cues and anonymity made the Internet an accessible and usable technology, for social connection; social support; social role participation and identity reconstruction. A major theme emerging from the data was control of self, which this study conceptually linked to identity reconstruction and psychosocial recovery. Findings allayed concerns regarding the negative potential of the Internet to increase social isolation of vulnerable people, as participants regarded face-to-face relationships as more fulfilling than online friendships, supporting classic communication theories (Rice, 1987; Rice &amp; Love, 1987), which propose that the Internet is a less personal medium than face-to-face communication, due to the feature of reduced cues. The findings of the method indicated that email facilitated qualitative interviewing addressed face-to-face interviewing barriers related to cognitive linguistic impairments; mobility factors; chronic health issues and environmental stimuli. Most participants indicated that asynchronicity, reduced cues, and anonymity facilitated control of communication, cognition and identity, thus enabling interview participation. The method had also advantages for the researcher, including time for reflection and the ability to yield richer data than in face-to-face contexts. However, the method was resource intensive, requiring information technology proficiency, familiarly with the impact of cognitive-linguistic impairments in online contexts and counselling experience. In addition, ethical guidelines required the involvement of a support person for the emotional protection of participants. This study makes two contributions to knowledge. One contribution relates to the potential of the Internet as an ICF environmental factor to address long-term psychosocial concerns, in addition to positively influencing psychosocial recovery from TBI, as reported by participants. This study contributes to a new era of research, which considers the impact of environmental factors on the experience of TBI, as framed by the ICF. The second contribution relates to the method of email facilitated qualitative interviewing, which advances knowledge of interviewing barriers for people with a TBI and addresses calls for innovative methods with this population. The findings of the method bring into question long held assumptions about the capacity of people with a TBI to participate in research and have implications for research design in qualitative and quantitative methodologies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traumatic Brain Injury (tbi)</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">email interviewing</field><field name="subject">psychosocial recovery</field><field name="subject">identity reconstruction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206190</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFLUENCE OF LONG WAVES AND WAVE GROUPS ON SWASH ZONE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CROSS-SHORE BEACH PROFILE EVOLUTION</field><field name="creator">Son Kim Pham</field><field name="description">There are only a few detailed measurements of the cross-shore variation in the net sediment transport and beach evolution for single or multiple swash events, and no data showing the influence of long waves and wave groups on swash zone morphology. Novel laboratory experiments and numerical modeling have been performed to study the influence of long waves and bichromatic wave groups on sediment transport and beach morphodynamics in the swash zone. Due to complex processes, difficulties in measuring, and very significant difficulties in isolating the morphodynamic processes induced by long waves and wave groups on natural beaches, a laboratory study was designed to measure in very high detail the bathymetric evolution of model sand beaches under monochromatic waves, long wave and short wave composites (free long waves), and bichromatic wave groups (forced long waves). Net sediment transport, Q(x), and beach morphology changes under the monochromatic waves were analyzed and compared to conditions with and without the free long waves, and then compared with the bichromatic wave groups. A range of wave conditions, e.g., high energy, moderate energy, and low energy waves, were used to obtain beach evolution ranging from accretionary to erosive, and including intermediate beach states. Hydrodynamics parameters, e.g., instantaneous water depths, wave amplitudes, run-up and rundown, were also measured to study and test a sediment transport model for the swash zone, based on modifying the energetic-bedload based sediment transport equations with suspended sediment. The experimental data clearly demonstrate that for the monochromatic wave conditions, beach evolution develops erosion for high steepness waves and accretion for lower steepness waves. The model beach profile evolutions are similar to natural beaches, and form and develop bars and berms over time. Adding a free long wave to the short wave in the composite wave results in changes to the overall trend of erosion/accretion of the beach profile, but the net transport pattern does not change significantly. The short wave strongly dominates beach behavior and the net transport rate, instead of the free long wave in the composite wave. The free long wave, however, carries more water and sediment onshore, leading to an increase in shoreline motion and wave run-up further landward. The long wave influences the structure and position of the swash bar/berm, which generally tends to move onshore and forms a larger swash bar/berm for higher long wave amplitudes. The free long wave also increases overall onshore sediment transport, and reduces offshore transport for erosive conditions. The long wave tends to protect the beach face and enhances onshore transport for accretive conditions, especially in the swash zone. In contrast, for bichromatic wave groups having the same mean energy flux as their corresponding monochromatic wave, the influence on sediment transports is generally offshore in both the surf and swash zone instead of onshore. The swash berm is, however, formed further landward compared with the berm of the corresponding monochromatic wave. The sediment transport patterns (erosion or accretion) generated by the bichromatic wave group or corresponding monochromatic wave are similar, but differ in magnitude. The numerical model, starting in the inner surf zone to reduce the effect of poor breaker description in the non-linear shallow water equations, can produce a good match between observed data and the modeled hydrodynamics parameters in the SZ. The sediment transport model shows the important role of suspended sediment in the swash zone. In contrast with the observed data, energetic-based bed-load models predict offshore sediment transport for most wave conditions because of negative skewness. The modified sediment transport model, with added suspended sediment terms and optimized coefficients, produces a good match between model results and observed data for each wave condition, especially for low frequency monochromatic waves. The optimized coefficient set corresponding to particular monochromatic wave conditions can be used to predict the net sediment transport quite well for some composite wave conditions. Overall, the same optimized coefficient sets can be applied to predict the correct overall trend of net transport for most composite wave conditions. However, the predicted net transport for the bichromatic wave groups does not match well with the overall net transport patterns. There is no set of single transport coefficients that can be used to predict sediment transport for all wave conditions. This suggests that the present sediment transport models cannot predict evolution correctly, even for conditions which represent only perturbation from those for which they were calibrated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sediment transport, beach morphodynamics, swash zone, monochromatic waves, composite wave, bichromatic wave group, sediment transport modeling.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206178</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accent Classification from Speech Samples by Use of Machine Learning</field><field name="creator">Carol Pedersen</field><field name="description">&#8220;Accent&#8221; is the pattern of speech pronunciation by which one can identify a person&#8217;s linguistic, social or cultural background. It is an important source of inter-speaker variability and a particular problem for automated speech recognition. The aim of the study was to investigate a new computational approach to accent classification which did not require phonemic segmentation or the identification of phonemes as input, and which could therefore be used as a simple, effective accent classifier. Through a series of structured experiments this study investigated the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for speech accent classification using time-based units rather than linguistically-informed ones, and compared it to the accuracy of other machine learning methods, as well as the ability of humans to classify speech according to accent. A corpus of read-speech was collected in two accents of English (Arabic and &#8220;Indian&#8221;) and used as the main datasource for the experiments. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients were extracted from the speech samples and combined into larger units of 10 to 150ms duration, which then formed the input data for the various machine learning systems. Support Vector Machines were found to classify the samples with up to 97.5% accuracy with very high precision and recall, using samples of between 1 and 4 seconds of speech. This compared favourably with a human listener study where subjects were able to distinguish between the two accent groups with an average of 92.5% accuracy in approximately 8 seconds. Repeating the SVM experiments on a different corpus resulted in a best classification accuracy of 84.6%. Experiments using a decision tree learner and a rule-based classifier on the original corpus gave a best accuracy of 95% but results over the range of conditions were much more variable than those using the SVM. Rule extraction was performed in order to help explain the results and better inform the design of the system. The new approach was therefore shown to be effective for accent classification, and a plan for its role within various other larger speech-related contexts was developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">accent</field><field name="subject">accent classification</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">support vector machines</field><field name="subject">mel-frequency cepstral coefficients</field><field name="subject">rule extraction</field><field name="subject">human listeners</field><field name="subject">corpus evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling, Optimisation and Advanced Duty Detection in a Mining Machine</field><field name="creator">Charles Mcinnes</field><field name="description">This thesis presents advanced algorithms for realtime detection of dragline duty, the quantification of its causes and the combined optimisation of dragline motion to minimise cycle time and duty. Draglines are large, powerful, rotating, multibody systems that operate in a similar manner to cranes and certain pick and place robots. Duty is an estimate of fatigue damage on the dragline boom caused by cyclic stresses that are associated with the repetitive dig and dump operation. Neither realtime detection of duty nor the quantification of its causes were previously available. In addition, no previous researchers have optimised the dynamic motion of mining equipment to achieve the combined maximisation of productivity and minimisation of maintenance measures. The advanced duty detection system was developed to improve feedback to dragline operators. The algorithms that were developed are based on the mechanics of dragline motion and fatigue. In particular, fatigue cycles in measured stress are identified at the earliest possible time, based on a novel proof and modification to the rainflow cycle counting algorithm. The contributions of specific causes to each individual stress range are quantified based on the mechanics of operator dependent control and dragline dynamics. In this manner, specific causes of duty are measured. The algorithms confirmed the significant contribution from operator dependent factors and identified the major causes, attributing 28% of the total duty to out-of-plane bucket motion and 15% to dynamic vibration. Further improvements to dragline performance required the development of a dragline dynamic model for offline testing and optimisation. A complete, condensed set of equations for a four-degree-of-freedom nonlinear coupled model of a dragline was derived using Lagrange&#8217;s method, allowing direct insight into dragline behaviour not available from previous research. The model was used to investigate the relationship between motor power, operator behaviour, bucket trajectory, productivity and duty during the swing and return phases of operation. Significant potential for increasing productivity and reducing duty was demonstrated. The advanced duty detection system and the dragline model were validated with field measured data, video footage, alternative modelling and expert review. Realtime and end-of-cycle feedback was simulated over many cycles of measured data. Experts from industry and research were consulted to verify the causes of duty based on detailed measured data analysis. The forces, stresses and out-of-plane angle predicted by the dragline model were closely compared with measured data over various indicative cycles. The dragline model was also validated against an alternative model constructed in ADAMS. The development of the dragline model enabled model-based numerical optimisation. Significant nonlinearities in the model and the constraints necessitated the use of the Lagrange multiplier method. The bucket trajectory during the swing and return phase was directly optimised. In order to minimise cycle time and duty, a penalty for duty incurred was added to the cycle time, effectively maximising long-term productivity. For a slew torque optimisation scenario using measured rope lengths, the numerical optimisation performance was shown to be 10-30% better than manual optimisation and 50-60% better than the operator performance. This thesis outlines several significant contributions to improving dragline performance. Underpinning the advanced duty detection system are three significant contributions to fatigue cycle counting algorithms: a proof of the equivalence of two pre-existing algorithms; a new algorithm that enables realtime detection of duty; and an algorithm that can attribute duty to specific causes. These novel feedback tools can provide realtime operator feedback and identify the causes of excess duty and when it was incurred. A complete and condensed set of equations for the four-degree-of-freedom model enabled, for the first time, the optimisation of dragline operation to concurrently reduce duty and increase productivity. The models and feedback algorithms were validated with field measured data. Future work could include installation and extension of the advanced duty detection system. In addition, further modelling and optimisation research could focus on improving the heuristics used for bucket trajectory control, realtime determination of optimum bucket trajectory and testing proposed dragline modifications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">duty monitoring</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">rainflow</field><field name="subject">mining dragline</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">Lagrange multiplier</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206298</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of developmental vitamin D deficiency on brain neurochemistry and behaviour in Sprague-Dawley rats</field><field name="creator">James Kesby</field><field name="description">Epidemiological studies indicate that maternal vitamin D deficiency may be a candidate developmental risk factor for schizophrenia. For example, people born in winter/spring, urban environments and dark-skinned individuals whose parents migrated to cooler climates are all at increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. The biological plausibility that a low prenatal level of vitamin D has an adverse impact on the developing brain has been studied using a developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficient rat model. These animals display molecular and anatomical abnormalities in brain development and alterations in behaviour as adults. Compared with control rats, neonatal DVD-deficient rat brains are different in shape; displaying a thinner cortex and larger lateral ventricles. Moreover, the brains appear to be less differentiated. At adulthood, DVD-deficient rats show an enhanced sensitivity to novelty-, antipsychotic- and psychomimetic- induced locomotion. These observations have lead to the hypothesis that dopamine and/or glutamate neurotransmission may be altered in DVD-deficient rats. Thus, the main aim of this thesis was to further characterise the dopamine and glutamate neurotransmitter systems in DVD-deficient rats. DVD-deficiency resulted in sex and age specific changes in dopamine signalling. At birth, DVD-deficient rats showed altered dopamine metabolism in the forebrain providing the first report of altered dopamine function after DVD-deficiency. Female DVD-deficient rats displayed a post-adolescent (at 3 months of age) enhanced response to amphetamine-induced locomotion. Accompanying this behavioural sensitivity were decreased levels of dopamine 1 and 2 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens. The altered behaviour in female DVD-deficient rats was not associated with increased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, caudate putamen or nucleus accumbens. Although a similar increase in the behavioural sensitivity to amphetamine was not observed in male DVD-deficient adult rats, increases in the density of the dopamine transporter were observed in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens. However, when examined at a mature adult age (6 months) neither the enhanced response to amphetamine, receptor or transporter changes persisted. These results suggest that after puberty a transient change in dopamine receptor signalling manifests as an altered response to amphetamine under certain environmental and experimental conditions. Glutamate signalling was probed with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. Adult male DVD-deficient rats showed an enhanced locomotor response to MK-801 and this persisted when examined at a mature adult age. Female DVD-deficient rats showed an enhanced response but this was only observed at the mature adult age examined. No behavioral differences were observed prior to adolescence. This behavioural sensitivity did not appear to be due to altered dopamine release after MK-801 in the prefrontal cortex and caudate putamen. Taken together, male DVD-deficient rats develop a locomotor sensitivity to MK-801 at an earlier age than DVD-deficient females. This behavioural alteration is not associated with altered dopamine function. The combined results from the studies in this thesis present a complex phenotype that suggests altered dopamine and glutamate interactions in DVD-deficient rats that are dynamic; demonstrating both age and sex specific traits. I speculate that the development of these behavioural and neurochemical alterations in DVD-deficient rats follows a similar temporal profile to the symptomology observed in schizophrenia patients. Both behavioural sensitivities to amphetamine and MK-801 are observed in schizophrenia in addition to a delayed onset of symptoms in females. This provides further support for a role of vitamin D in the developing brain and suggests that a transient deficiency can result in long-term behavioural and neurochemical alterations. Together this suggests that the DVD-deficient rat model may be an informative model for exploring the developmental vitamin D deficiency hypothesis of schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin D</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">Developement</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Rat</field><field name="subject">Animal Model</field><field name="subject">Dopamine</field><field name="subject">Glutamate</field><field name="subject">amphetamine</field><field name="subject">Mk-801</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206305</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Pathways for Elite Coaching: A Study of Australian Softball Coaches</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Horton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the attributes and experiences that are perceived priorities for recruitment to become a high performance coach in the sport of Softball in Australia. The study was undertaken in the form of 10 cases of nationally identified coaches and administrators (men and women). Each participant was interviewed using semi-structured questions. The interpretive study gave an intensive description and analysis of coach experiences, attributes and qualifications that are perceived as highly desirable for coach selection by Softball Australia for high performance coaches. The basis for collection and analysis of information was via individual cognitive perspectives and perceptions (through interviews) and individual behaviours (through observation) with the intention to interpret and consider the presence of common themes. Findings may serve to identify, support and direct potential high performance coaches and contribute to the effectiveness of formal coaching education programs. The study focused on the sport of softball which has had a mixed profile over time, from one of almost obscurity to that of an Olympic sport. Australia has had an extremely impressive record internationally. It is currently ranked as the world&#8217;s best softball nation based on international performances by the Australian under 19 Men, Open Men, under 19 Women and Open Women&#8217;s Teams (SA 2008). Australia was the only country ranked in the top three in all age groups competing in World Championships. The importance of this study to softball coaches was to encapsulate the reality of how selectors make determination on performance coaching selections, and was this in line with what performance coaches perceive as the priorities. This may have two direct effects on the performance coach. Firstly, it may allow the coach to develop a career path that may best suit their qualities and attributes. Secondly, it may allow the coach to undertake further learning and development in the areas that the selectors perceive the coach does not meet the required standard of merit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elite sports coaching, career pathways, Australian softball</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206303</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ATTACHMENT AND CONTROL OF SALMONELLA AND LISTERIA IN SHRIMP</field><field name="creator">Wan Norhana Md Noordin</field><field name="description">Spoilage and the presence of pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella, are among the most common reasons for shrimp product detentions and recalls. In addition, both listeriosis and salmonellosis have been associated with the consumption of shrimp. For these reasons, there is interest in reducing Listeria and Salmonella contamination of shrimps. A review of literature indicated no detailed study that described the attachment of Listeria and Salmonella onto shrimps and their resulting persistence. In addition, information related to the control of these two pathogens on fresh shrimps is also limited. The work reported in this thesis aims to partially fill these gaps. These aims were met through four studies. In the first study, the initial attachment and colonization of Listeria and Salmonella onto fresh and cooked shrimp carapaces and tissue was examined. The chitinolytic activity and the physicochemical properties namely cellular surface charge (CSC), hydrophobicity and electron donor/acceptor potential were also determined for all the strains. CSC was determined using zeta potential measurements. Hydrophobicity was determined using three hydrophobicity determination methods, while microbial adhesion to solvents was used to determine the electron donor/acceptor potential. Attachment and colonization of Listeria and Salmonella were demonstrated. Abdominal carapaces showed higher levels of bacterial attachment (p&lt;0.05) than head carapaces while Listeria consistently exhibited greater attachment (p&lt;0.05) than Salmonella on all surfaces. Chitinase activity of all strains was tested and found not to occur at the three temperatures (10&#176;, 25&#176; and 37&#176;C) tested. Salmonella had significantly (p&lt;0.05) more positive CSC than Listeria. A significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in surface roughness between abdominal and head carapaces was noted. From the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that certain bacterial physicochemical properties and carapace roughness were involved in the attachment to carapaces but not attachment to tissue or colonization to carapace and tissue. The influence of attachment and colonization of Listeria and Salmonella onto shrimp surfaces on the resistance against environmental stress was investigated in the second study. Planktonic, attached and colonized cells of Listeria and Salmonella were challenged with high (50&#176;, 60&#176; and 70&#176;C) and low (4&#176;C) temperature, 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution, and acetic, hydrochloric and lactic acids (pH 4.0). Attached and colonized Listeria and Salmonella showed significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) resistance to heat (~1.3-2.6 fold increase in D-values), hypochlorite (~6.6-&gt;40.0 fold) and acids (~4.0-9.0 fold) than their planktonic counterparts. There were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in the survival of planktonic, attached or colonized cells of Listeria and Salmonella stored under refrigerated conditions. The increase in resistance observed in attached and colonized cells could have an important implication for shrimp product&#8217;s safety in general. In the third study, bilimbi (Averrhoa bilimbi L.) and tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) juices were used to reduce Listeria monocytogenes Scott A and Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 populations on raw shrimps after washing and during storage (4&#186;C). The uninoculated raw shrimps and those inoculated with L. monocytogenes Scott A and S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 were washed (dipped or rubbed) in sterile distilled water (SDW) (control), bilimbi or tamarind juice. Naturally occurring aerobic bacteria (APC), L. monocytogenes Scott A and S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 counts of washed shrimps were determined on days 0, 3 and 7 of storage. Compared to SDW, bilimbi and tamarind juice significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced APC, L. monocytogenes Scott A and S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 numbers on day 0. There was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in bacterial reduction between the dipping and rubbing methods. Regardless of washing treatments or methods, populations of S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 decreased slightly while populations of L. monocytogenes Scott A and APC increased significantly during refrigerated storage. These results suggest that consumable household items could be adopted as a natural method of decontaminating shrimps just before preparation and consumption. In the final study, use of nisin alone and in combinations with EDTA and salts of organic acids (potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, or sodium diacetate) to control L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and native microflora on fresh shrimps were evaluated. Uninoculated, and Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella inoculated, shrimps were dipped in treatment solutions, vacuum packaged and stored at 4&#186;C for 7 days. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and native microflora counts were determined on days 0, 3 and 7. Nisin-EDTA-potassium sorbate and nisin-EDTA-sodium diacetate significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) L. monocytogenes numbers by 0.94-1.20 and 1.07-1.29 log CFU/g respectively, as compared to the control. All treatments failed to reduce (p&gt;0.05) Salmonella counts on shrimps. At the end of storage, the native microflora counts on all nisin-EDTA-organic acids salts treated shrimps were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than the control. The results suggest that some of the treatments can be used to improve shrimp microbial safety and shelf-life.

However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASCOVIRUS INFECTION: Role of microRNAs and viral encoded genes in gene silencing and pathogenesis</field><field name="creator">Malik Hussain</field><field name="description">Abstract Ascoviruses (AVs) are members of the family Ascoviridae that are transmitted by female endoparasitic wasps and cause lethal infection in lepidopteran insects. AVs possess large double stranded DNA genomes ranging from 116-186 kbp. Recently, genomes of four AV species have been completely sequenced and have revealed important genes potentially needed for virus DNA replication and infection. Phylogenetic analyses of several of these genes indicate that AVs are closely related to iridoviruses and likely evolved from them. Two unique features, mode of transmission and cytopathology which involves cleavage of cells into virus-containing vesicles, make AVs different from other insect pathogenic viruses. During this decade, tremendous advancements in the study of RNA silencing mechanisms have openned a new dimension in virology. It is now evident that viruses reshape the cellular environment by reprogramming host RNA silencing machinery. The process of RNA silencing involves small non-coding RNAs, which with the help of nuclease-containing regulatory proteins bind to complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, resulting in inhibition of gene expression. This sophisticated style of gene regulation has attained a fundamental status in living organisms, since RNA silencing has been revealed to be ubiquitous from viruses to prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Two main categories of small RNAs, short interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have been defined as major players in RNA silencing. Interestingly, viral genomes like that of their hosts, encode miRNAs that can be used during virus invasion to manipulate host genes as well as miRNA biogenesis. Here, we report on the identification of the first insect virus miRNA (HvAVmiR- 1) derived from the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of Heliothis virescens ascovirus 7 (HvAV3e). HvAV-miR-1 expression was found to be strictly regulated and specifically detected from 96 h post-infection. HvAV-miR-1 expression coincides with a marked reduction of the expression of HvAV3e DNA polymerase I, which is a predicted target. Ectopic expression of the full-length and truncated versions of MCP retaining the miRNA sequence significantly reduced DNA polymerase I transcript levels and inhibited viral replication. Our results indicate that HvAV-miR-1 directs degradation of DNA polymerase I transcripts and regulates replication of HvAV3e. Further, we investigated changes in the expression levels of host miRNAs upon HvAV3e infection in an insect cell line derived from Helicoverpa zea fat body and investigated the role of a host miRNA, Hz-miR24, in the hostvirus system. It was found that Hz-miR24 is differentially expressed following virus infection, with an increase in its expression levels late in infection. Functional analyses demonstrated that Hz-miR24 targets viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and its &#946; subunit mRNAs. This was confirmed using ectopic expression of Hz-miR24 and a green fluorescent protein-based reporter system. Expression of the target gene was substantially enhanced in cells transfected with a synthesized inhibitor of Hz-miR24. These findings suggest that ascoviruses encode their own miRNA(s) and concurrently manipulate host miRNAs that in turn regulate the expression of their genes at specific time points after infection. In connection to RNA silencing, we characterized a ribonuclease III (RNase III) protein encoded by HvAV3e. We found that RNase III protein was functional in vivo as well as in vitro and catalyzed long and short double stranded RNAs. Expression analyses during virus infection revealed autoregulation of this protein by degradation of its RNA transcripts. Moreover, RNase III protein was found to be involved in suppression of RNA silencing and essential for virus DNA replication and infection. Finally, we studied another ascoviral 8 protein, a putative inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), which was found to be essential for virus DNA replication and pathology. Further, despite inhibition of apoptosis by HvAV3e, the IAP-like protein was found dispensable for the inhibition of replication. In conclusion, for successful invasion and attenuation of host antiviral responses, ascoviruses seem to utilize viral encoded proteins as well as miRNAs. Since the genomes of these viruses have only recently been sequenced, the role of many of the encoded genes essential for pathogenesis and manipulation of antiviral defence mechanisms remains to be eluciated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">ascovirus, apoptosis, DNA replication, RNA interference, microRNA, dicer,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF HABITAT STRUCTURE AND COMPETITION IN THE ECOLOGY OF LISTERIA SPECIES IN FOOD-RELATED AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTS</field><field name="creator">Sally Chiu</field><field name="description">Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen with a high mortality rate in susceptible populations and is of great public health concern with regard to food safety. The ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures during storage and at low pH levels during food processing has enabled the species to establish and sustain growth on processed food. Some food products particularly at risk of contamination by L. monocytogenes are deli or processed meat products, seafood, processed vegetables, dairy products and other food that do not require heating or reheating before consumption. The aims of this study are therefore to investigate firstly the prevalence rates of the species in high risk food products and a food processing plant in Brisbane. Secondly, to determine whether food isolates are better than environmental isolates at surviving the stress factors in food processing environments, or if their lineage groupings are a better indicator of their survival. Thirdly, to compare the survival of food and environmental isolates under temperature stress in co-cultures. A survey of more than 100 high-risk food products at supermarkets was carried out to investigate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes and other Listeria species in food. Isolates were also obtained from a food processing plant during routine tests. This study has found a low prevalence rate (under 10%) of L. monocytogenes in the processed vegetables and meat products tested. Other products tested included processed and raw seafood and processed fresh fruit. More L. monocytogenes isolates were isolated from the food processing plant (101) than from the food survey (25). Listeria grayi (73 isolates), a non-pathogenic species, was more frequently isolated from the food survey. The characterisation of those isolates has revealed their lineage groupings and REP-PCR profiles, which did not appear to be related to their sources. A selected group of 25 isolates were also serotyped for further identification. A larger number of lineage II isolates (70) were found compared to lineage I isolates (25), and were more common in food than the environments; while some (7) produced inconclusive results in the lineage PCR. The REP-PCR did not separate isolates of different sources, lineages or serotypes. In order to investigate the survival fitness of L. monocytogenes isolates whilst under environmental stress relevant to food safety, ten isolates from the food survey and food processing plant were chosen. Five isolates each from lineages I and II were subjected to temperatures ranging from 4&#186;C to 30&#186;C and pH levels from 4.0 to 6.0 for two weeks continuously, with their growth monitored by either optical density or plate counts. It was found that the isolates were most susceptible at the combination of pH 4.0 and 4&#186;C, where the growth of the isolates was completely inhibited. Again no relationship was observed between the lineage or the sources and the survival fitness of the chosen isolates. Due to the frequency of L. monocytogenes being co-isolated with other Listeria species as well as other food-borne pathogens, the relative competitive fitness of four of the isolates from the survival fitness experiment were compared in co-cultures at 4&#186;C and 30&#186;C at pH 7.4 in a small-scale preliminary study. The four isolates from food and environments were grown in broth cultures in pairs with the plate counts performed on antibiotic-supplemented selective TSA agar. The isolates were distinguished on agar supplemented with tetracycline which the isolates had acquired resistance to for this purpose. No significant difference (P&gt;0.05) was observed between the lineages or the sources and the competitive fitness of the isolates in this study. The isolates always produced slightly more colonies in the antibioticresistant form compared to the wildtype form but did not seem to relate to the competitive fitness of the isolates. It would seemed that within the scope of this study, neither the lineage, serotype nor source of the isolates indicated any isolate with a better ability of survival while at low temperatures and low pH levels in pure and mixed cultures. However, other classifying groups such as serotypes, RAPD profiles may reveal possible co-relations, as well as a wider isolate pool. Furthermore, different stress factors could be included as part of an investigation on the survival of L. monocytogenes, as this study focused on food safety during processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Listeria species</field><field name="subject">Listeria monocytogenes</field><field name="subject">processed meat</field><field name="subject">food survey</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">cold temperature</field><field name="subject">low pH</field><field name="subject">mixed cultures</field><field name="subject">tetracycline</field><field name="subject">lineage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206368</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CLONING, CHARACTERISATION AND VACCINE EFFICACY OF SCHISTOSOMA JAPONICUM INSULIN RECEPTORS</field><field name="creator">Hong You</field><field name="description">Adult schistosomes depend for growth and development on hormonal signals from the mammalian host, which may include the insulin signalling pathway. In this project, I firstly used microarray analysis to demonstrate that human insulin can be utilised by adult S. japonicum in culture, resulting in the modulation of distinct metabolic effects as reflected in transcriptional levels of parasite genes. The addition of insulin resulted in the differential expression of 1,101 genes with many related to functions corresponding to the biological and metabolic effects of insulin reported for mammalian cells. Those identified genes in male or female S. japonicum worms that were up or down regulated after exposure to insulin were predominantly involved in growth and development, with significant sex-specific responses evident. Insulin appeared to play a similar role in male parasites as those seen in classical mammalian systems including an increase in protein synthesis though gene transcription and the stimulation of mRNA translation and control protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Microarray analysis indicated that insulin not only leads to increased gene expression of the PI3-K pathway, which enhances parasite growth, but may also play a role in the sexual differentiation and fecundity of female worms by activating the MAPK pathway. As the insulin target proteins, two types of insulin receptors from Schistosoma japonicum were isolated, S. japonicum insulin receptors 1 (SjIR-1) and 2 (SjIR-2), with features similar to insulin receptors from other taxa. The sequences share 70% and 74% identity to S. mansoni insulin receptor 1 and 2 (SmIR-1 and SmIR-2), respectively. SjIR-1 and SjIR-2 are highly conserved in their tyrosine kinase domain to other IRs from Homo, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster. SjIR-2 is located in the parenchyma in males and in the vitelline glands of female worms, which occupy most of male or female tissue and play an important role in growth or fecundity. In contrast, SjIR-1 was located in the tegument and intestinal epithelium of adult worms, representing much smaller cellular regions compared with the voluminous vitelline tissue or parenchyma. This observation was further confirmed by real time PCR showing that SjIR-2 was more abundantly expressed in S. japonicum adult worm than SjIR-1. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SjIR-2 and SmIR-2 are closer to EmIR than to SjIR-1 and SmIR-1, indicating that SjIR-1 and SmIR-1 might perform specific functions in schistosomes, while SjIR-2, SmIR-2 and EmIR might share similar roles in parasite growth and development in the three parasitic flatworms. Structure modelling recovered the conserved structure between the SjIRs and Homo sapiens IR (HIR) implying a common predicted binding mechanism in the ligand domain and the same downstream signal transduction processing in the tyrosine kinase domain as in HIR. Two-hybrid analysis was used to confirm that the ligand domains of SjIR-1 and SjIR-2 contain the insulin binding site. Incubation of adult worms in vitro, both with a specific insulin receptor inhibitor and anti-SjIRs antibodies, resulted in a significant decrease in worm glucose levels, suggesting again the same function for SjIRs in regulating glucose uptake as described for mammalian cells. Adult worms of S. japonicum possess insulin receptors that can specifically bind to insulin, indicating that the parasite can utilize host insulin for development and growth by sharing the same pathway as mammalian cells in regulating glucose uptake. In vaccination/challenge trials, there was no significant reduction in adult worm burdens with either of the SjLD vaccines. However, there were significant reductions in mean lengths of adult worms ranging from 22-25% in the SjLD1 vaccinated group to 37-42% in the SjLD2 vaccinated groups, significant reductions in faecal eggs in both the SjLD1 (66%) and SjLD2 (68%) vaccinated groups, and a reduction in liver egg numbers in the SjLD1(33%) vaccinated group. These results show that although the SjLDs vaccines were unable to reduce adult worm numbers by clearing them from the vaccinated mice, nevertheless, they significantly depressed the growth of male and female adult worms and affected female egg production. The protective efficacy obtained in terms of the substantial decrease in faecal eggs exceeded that of many of the recently available schistosome antigens and prototype vaccine formulations, which, at best, elicit 40&#8211;50% protection in animals using the standard readouts of reduced worm burden or egg production and viability. Overall, disruption of this insulin pathway leading to parasite starvation through the prevention of glucose uptake thereby affecting parasite growth, development and female fecundity, provides a new intervention target and transmission blocking approach to combat schistosomiasis and may be applicable for the control of other debilitating parasitic infections as well.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schistosoma japonicum</field><field name="subject">insulin receptor</field><field name="subject">microarray analysis</field><field name="subject">immunolocalisation</field><field name="subject">vaccine efficacy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calcium influx regulators in mammary gland development and breast cancer: Roles of ORAI and STIM isoforms</field><field name="creator">Damara McAndrew</field><field name="description">Calcium is the major mineral component of milk and is essential for neonatal development. To enrich the milk, calcium must pass from the maternal bloodstream, through mammary epithelial cells, into the alveolar lumen. While calcium extrusion from the epithelial cells is well characterized, no calcium channel or transporter has been identified as the major conduit for calcium to enter the mammary epithelial cell from the bloodstream. A major aim of this thesis was to identify a calcium channel or channels responsible for calcium influx into mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate in vivo expression of calcium channels in the murine mammary gland at the four main stages of mammary gland development. The store-operated calcium channel Orai1 was upregulated during lactation relative to its expression in the nulliparous gland. The classic ORAI1 regulator Stim1 was not similarly overexpressed during lactation, however, its isoform Stim2 was modestly upregulated. HC11 murine mammary cells were used as a model to further investigate the role of STIM2 on calcium handling during lactation. siRNA knockdown of Stim2 reduced both basal and agonist-induced peak cytosolic calcium levels, indicative of its role in calcium regulation. In addition to investigating the role of calcium channels in normal mammary development, their role in breast cancer was examined. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to identify calcium channels upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines, relative to non-tumorigenic mammary cell lines. TRPV1, TRPV6, and ORAI1 were upregulated in the breast cancer cell lines. Pharmacological modulation of ORAI1 resulted in modest changes in proliferation, but as there was no specific ORAI1 inhibitor, this effect could not be conclusively attributed to ORAI1 inhibition. siRNA was used to specifically target ORAI1 in three human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T-47D. siRNA knockdown of ORAI1 was specific and potent, and reduced cell viability and altered calcium handing in all three cell lines. The alterations caused by ORAI1 knock down were not related to the expression of the genes CDK2 and FOS, as these did not change upon ORAI1 knockdown. Data mining was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#8217;s (NCBI&#8217;s) expressed sequence tag (EST) database, dbEST, and the Oncomine database. ORAI1 was elevated in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers and in the basal breast cancer molecular subtype, a subtype that has a poor prognosis. Other data suggested that breast cancer cells with high STIM1 and low STIM2 expression also correlated with the basal breast cancer subtype. These data indicate that ORAI and STIM proteins have a role in the physiological process of lactation as well as in the regulation of tumorigenic pathways in the breast, and particular gene expression profiles may be predictors of disease prognosis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calcium</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Lactation</field><field name="subject">mammary gland</field><field name="subject">ORAI1</field><field name="subject">STIM2</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206366</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms for Collision Hulls and their Applications to Path Planning</field><field name="creator">Zane Smith</field><field name="description">The potential benefits that automation could bring to a wide variety of real-world tasks are numerous and well recognised. There has been significant research undertaken into automation in general, but for real-time automation of complex systems (involving complex geometries and dynamics) the problem is far from a solved one. One of the key tasks in a surface mining operation is that of using shovels or excavators to load material onto haul trucks for transportation. Since it is such a crucial task to a number of production cycles, it is a clear area where the productivity and safety benefits of automation could have a large impact. A number of projects are being undertaken concurrently to move towards first partial, and then full, automation of this mining subsystem. This thesis focusses on the collision avoidance problem, specifically on forming a collision hull that distinguishes between intersecting and non-intersecting configurations of two objects. Techniques from computer graphics are leveraged to develop a data structure that stores and organises relevant information about real-world systems for motion-planning tasks, ensuring that the necessary data is available and in a form suited to the task at hand. The Minkowski Sum operation, which can be used fairly directly to form the collision hull of two convex objects under translation, is extended to develop an operation to form the exact collision hull of two arbitrary objects to determine the applicability of such a scheme to complex systems in real-time. A level of detail solution is then proposed, where the Minkowski Hull of bounding hierarchies allows unnecessary parts of the hull to be calculated only in a coarse manner, thus offsetting a lot of the computational cost for any given test. This approach is investigated for both translational motion and joint-space motion. Collision detection is not collision avoidance, and so the algorithms developed in the thesis are tested in a number of applications, to demonstrate their suitability to the collision avoidance task. The applications (discrete collision prediction, visibility graph path planning, and the formulation of a Model Predictive Controller) are restricted versions of the true problems with some simplifying assumptions, but they show the algorithms to be capable both in their execution speed and the information that they provide.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Minkowski Sum</field><field name="subject">collision hull</field><field name="subject">collision avoidance</field><field name="subject">path planning</field><field name="subject">mining automation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206476</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CD4+ T cells provide help to CD8+ T cells in immune recall responses in skin.</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Broom</field><field name="description">Immune responses to antigens presented at skin, or other epithelial surfaces such as the cervix, are important for the clearance of viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) that infect epithelial cells [13]. Elucidation of the components of an effective immune response to antigens presented in this manner will potentially aid in design of immune modulatory techniques or therapeutic vaccine strategies to treat conditions such as cervical cancer. This thesis addresses the role of CD4+ T lymphocytes in immune responses to antigens presented in skin. CD4+ T cells have a well established role in the priming of CD8+ T cells, such that priming without help results in defective CD8+ T cell memory response [15]. The role of CD4+ T cells in the immune response subsequent to priming is less well delineated [15, 16]. Murine skin grafting is a model of antigen presented at an epithelial surface. The model used in this thesis utilises grafts transgenically expressing neo-antigens (human growth hormone=hGH, ovalbumin=OVA) under the control of a keratin promoter (K14 or K5) in the graft. The corresponding mice are termed K14hGH and K5mOVA. With hGH as the antigen, rejection of such skin grafts were shown to require CD4+ T cells [1]. The most surprising finding was that this requirement for CD4+ T cells was maintained even in an antigen-experienced host (in the recall immune response to hGH). CD4+ T cells are required by graft-primed recipients to reject hGH-expressing grafts, but are not required to reject grafts expressing alternative antigens such as OVA. In an adoptive transfer model into lymphopaenic hosts, when high numbers of CD8+ T cells were transferred, any addition of CD4+ T cells was superfluous. However, with low numbers of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells, the addition of CD4+ T cells resulted in a significantly faster rate of K5mOVA skin graft rejection. This helper enhancement of K5mOVA skin graft rejection is maintained, even 7 when CD8+ T cells were previously activated to a memory phenotype prior to transfer, indicating that CD4+ T cells do have effects after CTL priming in vivo. The requirement for CD4+ T cells in the rejection of C57.K14hGH grafts is abrogated by the addition of a local inflammatory stimulus (TLR7 agonist, imiquimod). This is a local rather than systemic effect, suggesting an influence on trafficking or local effector function. Administration of agonist anti-CD40 antibody also partially abrogates the need for CD4+ T cells in rejection of C57.K14hGH grafts by primed hosts. Although CD40 has a well established role in priming of na&#239;ve CTL responses, our findings indicate that CD40 can alter events after priming, and suggests a possible mechanism for the role of CD4+ T cells in this system. With these data, we speculate that CD4+ T cells may provide help by altering the state of APC cross-presenting antigen to experienced CD8+ T cells, and that this can be substituted by TLR or CD40 mediated activation of APC. The result may be an increased number of effector CD8+ T cells, as we demonstrate that high numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells can abrogate this effect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cd4 T Cells</field><field name="subject">secondary immune response</field><field name="subject">Skin Graft</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206479</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of resuscitation fluids on beta lactam antibiotic pharmacokinetics in interstitial tissue in acute thermal injury</field><field name="creator">Kanchanamala Ranasinghe</field><field name="description">Advantages and disadvantages of administration of resuscitation fluids in burns patients have been discussed at length. However, the effect of resuscitation fluids on tissue physiological endpoints and tissue antibiotic distribution is scarcely reported, yet clinically crucial. The preliminary studies of this thesis involved evaluation of the literature and the development of a non - recovery anaesthetized rat model of burn injury suitable for the study of plasma and tissue physiological changes and antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PK). Therefore, the first series of the studies for this thesis was designed to examine the relative effects of a range of crystalloid and colloid-containing resuscitation fluids on tissue pH following burn injury in a rat model. The secondary aims were to examine the effects of these fluids on tissue blood flow, plasma protein extravasation (PPE) and evaporative water loss (EWL). In these studies we confirmed that the burn injury and fluid resuscitation were accompanied by a tissue acidosis. Administration of Lactated Ringers&#8217; Albumin (LRA) and Lactated Ringers&#8217; Dextran (LRD) effectively attenuated the degree of tissue acidosis in the thermally injured and non injured sites for 180 minutes post burn and the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) on the non injured sites during the first 60 minutes of the acute phase of burn injury. The second phase of the work was designed to assess the changes in antibiotic distribution with the administration of these different fluids in plasma as well as in interstitial tissues in the burn and the non burn sites. This study showed that for cephalothin (4g/kg body weight, administered intravenously (IV)), Lactated Ringers solution (LR) and Hypertonic Saline (HS) showed similar plasma PK with Time &gt; Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (&gt; 180 minutes) in plasma. However, the antibiotic tissue distribution was more skewed towards lower levels for HS when compared with LR. For piperacillin (18g/kg body weight, administered IV), Time &gt; MIC was considerably low comparatively, being only 55 min for both LR and HS. Antibiotic concentrations did not reach the MIC with LRA resuscitation. When considering the interstitial tissues, Time &gt; MIC for cephalothin was lower than HS with LR on both the burn and the non burn sites. T &gt; MIC for piperacillin was zero for all fluids in both burn and non burn sites. The major finding of this study was that with LRA resuscitation, antibiotic distribution was significantly lower than seen with LR and HS for both antibiotics studied in the interstitial tissue fluid space in both the burn and non burn sites. The final phase of the work was designed to study the apparent permeability co efficient of Keratinocytes (KC) to antibiotics in the presence of simulated pH changes observed in burn tissue in thermal injury using colloids and crystalloids. This study found that there was no significant difference between the basolateral and apical concentrations of antibiotics observed neither with the different pH values nor with time. However, there was definitely a significant difference in the apparent permeability of the cells with LR vs LRA and that the permeability was higher with LR than LRA. This study confirmed that the presence of LR allows greater permeation of the antibiotic into the KC, and also that with LRA resuscitation, the antibiotic tends to stay at higher concentrations in the interstitial compartment. These studies demonstrate that choice of resuscitation fluid following burn injury can affect both changes in tissue physiology and antibiotic distribution, warranting further study in both animal models and patient populations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resuscitation fluids</field><field name="subject">Beta lactam antibiotics</field><field name="subject">Antibiotic pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Pharmacodynamics</field><field name="subject">Microdialysis</field><field name="subject">Acute thermal injury</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206569</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Methodologies for Power System Security and Vulnerability Analysis</field><field name="creator">Guo Chen</field><field name="description">Nowadays, with the rapid expansion of increasing utilization of renewable energy sources, power grid is evolving into a much complex man-made system in the technological age. Under the new circumstances, traditional methodologies for power system security analysis are facing a serious challenge. For the past decade, many countries have experienced large blackouts, which expose potential problems of current models and methodologies in power industry. On the other hand, since the 9.11 event and frequent suicide bombing attacks in some countries, terrorism has become a major threat for national security. With the extensive growth of terrorism activities, power system, the significant critical infrastructure, probably becomes the target of terrorists. If this happens, the impact is dramatically severe and may yield more frequent blackouts. This Ph.D. thesis aims at developing some advanced models and methodologies for exploring the vulnerability of power system and protecting it against potential terrorism threat. The dissertation mainly consists of the following four parts. (1)Complex network theory based power system security and vulnerability analysis methodologies are introduced. Mathematically, an interconnected complex power grid can be described as a complex network of nodes connected by edges. Generally speaking, topology parameters of network structure include important information of the structure. That is to say, some critical nodes and lines can have significant impact on large-scale blackouts. The thesis will present a new methodology to recognize those critical nodes and lines in power grids. (2)Complex system theory based power grid security and vulnerability analysis methodologies are presented. Power grid is a complex dynamic evolutionary system over years with continuous expansion so as to underpin the ongoing increase of power demand. Some properties of complex systems may have important relationship with large-scale blackouts. In other words, there may be some stages of evolutionary power systems that would be more likely to cause large blackouts. The thesis will investigate the relationship to identify those critical stages of power grids. (3)Game theory is applied to methodologies for power system security and vulnerability analysis. Terrorists are often considered as fully intelligent and strategic actors who can even hire scientists and power engineers to seek the vulnerability of power systems and then launch a vital attack. Game theory does treat actors as fully strategic players and has been successfully applied to many disciplines including economics, political science and military. The thesis will present new models and analysis methods for protecting power systems under terrorism attacks. (4)Cyber security technology is considered in power system security and vulnerability analysis. It is known that information technology plays an import role in today and next generation grid. In this situation, cyber security should be an important issue. If it is vulnerable to malicious threats such as hackers and cyber-terrorists, power grid will not reach its full capabilities. The thesis will present an initial framework to reduce the vulnerability of power grid against potential cyber attack.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Complex Networks, Complex Systems, Game Theory, Cyber Security, Vulnerability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206641</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Optical Flow for Indoor Mobile Robot Obstacle Avoidance.</field><field name="creator">Tobias Low</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of visual-motion information sampled through optical flow for the task of indoor obstacle avoidance on autonomous mobile robots. The methods focus on the practical use of optical flow and visual motion information in performing the obstacle avoidance task in real indoor environments. The methods serve to identify visual-motion properties that must be used in synergy with visual-spatial properties toward the goal of a complete robust visual-only obstacle avoidance system, as is evidently seen within nature. A review of vision-based obstacle avoidance techniques shows that early research mainly focused on visual-spatial techniques, which heavily rely on various assumptions of their environments to function successfully. On the other hand, more current research that looks toward the use of visual-motion information (sampled through optical flow) tends to focus on using optical flow in a subsidiary manner, and does not completely take advantage of the information encoded within an optical flow field. In the light of the current research limitations, this thesis describes two different approaches and evaluates their use of optical flow to perform the obstacle avoidance task. The first approach begins with the construction of a conventional range map using optical flow that stems from the structure-from-motion domain and the theory that optical flow encodes 3D environmental information under certain conditions. The second approach investigates optical flow in a causal mechanistic manner using machine learning of motor responses directly from optical flow - motivated from physical and behavioural evidence observed in biological creatures. Specifically, the second approach is designed with three main objectives in mind: 1) to investigate whether optical flow can be learnt for obstacle avoidance; 2) to create a system capable of repeatable obstacle avoidance performance in real-life environments; and 3) to analyse the system to determine what optical flow properties are actually being used for the motor control task. The range-map reconstruction results have demonstrated some good distance estimations through the use of a feature-based optical flow algorithm. However, the number of flow points were too sparse to provide adequate obstacle detection. Results froma differential-based optical flow algorithm helped to increase the density of flow points, but highlighted the high sensitivity of the optical flow field to the rotational errors and outliers that plague the majority of frames under real-life robot situations. Final results demonstrated that current optical flow algorithms are ill-suited to estimate obstacle distances consistently, as range-estimation techniques require an extremely accurate optical flow field with adequate density and coverage for success. This is a difficult problem within the optical flow estimation domain itself. In the machine learning approach, an initial study to examine whether optical flow can be machine learnt for obstacle avoidance and control in a simple environment was successful. However,there were certain problems. Several critical issues which arise with the use of a machine learning approach were highlighted. These included sample set completeness, sample set biases, and control system instability. Consequently, an extended neural network was proposed that had several improvements made to overcome the initial problems. Designing an automated system for gathering training data helped to eliminate most of the sample set problems. Key changes in the neural network architecture, optical flow filters, and navigation technique vastly improved the control system stability. As a result, the extended neural network system was able to successfully perform multiple obstacle avoidance loops in both familiar and unfamiliar real-life environments without collisions. The lap times of the machine learning approach were comparable to those of the laser-based navigation technique. The the machine learning approach was 13% slower in the familiar and 25% slower in the unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, through analysis of the neural network approach, flow magnitudes were revealed to be learnt for range information in an absolute manner, while flow directions were used to detect the focus of expansion (FOE) in order to predict critical collision situations and improve control stability. In addition, the precision of the flow fields was highlighted as an important requirement, as opposed to the high accuracy of flow vectors. For robot control purposes, image-processing techniques such as region finding and object boundary detection were employed to detect changes between optical flow vectors in the image space.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">optical flow</field><field name="subject">obstacle avoidance</field><field name="subject">visual motion</field><field name="subject">mobile robots</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">neural network</field><field name="subject">navigation</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206815</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foundations and Applications of Entanglement Renormalization</field><field name="creator">Glen Evenbly</field><field name="description">Understanding the collective behavior of a quantum many-body system, a system composed of a large number of interacting microscopic degrees of freedom, is a key aspect in many areas of contemporary physics. However, as a direct consequence of the difficultly of the so-called many-body problem, many exotic quantum phenomena involving extended systems, such as high temperature superconductivity, remain not well understood on a theoretical level. Entanglement renormalization is a recently proposed numerical method for the simulation of many-body systems which draws together ideas from the renormalization group and from the field of quantum information. By taking due care of the quantum entanglement of a system, entanglement renormalization has the potential to go beyond the limitations of previous numerical methods and to provide new insight to quantum collective phenomena. This thesis comprises a significant portion of the research development of ER following its initial proposal. This includes exploratory studies with ER in simple systems of free particles, the development of the optimisation algorithms associated to ER, and the early applications of ER in the study of quantum critical phenomena and frustrated spin systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Entanglement renormalization</field><field name="subject">Quantum many-body systems</field><field name="subject">Tensor networks</field><field name="subject">Simulation algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207551</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Type from type</field><field name="creator">Smith, Warren Eden</field><field name="description">The locus of this project is in the field of type face design, with the origins of the project based on an appreciation of the Letraset brand1 dry transfer system (instant lettering and other elements included in the system) and the way they were used and/or mis-used.

Drawing on relevant philosophical and psychological theory the study describes the development of an educational programme grounded in the procedures of ethical inquiry and taught via whole-class community of inquiry style discussions. The programme was trialled by way of a large scale, matched intervention study in South Australian upper primary classrooms. The findings from the research project indicate that participation in the programme produced significant gains in participants' logical and ethical reasoning and also that the programme fits within the constraints of prevailing educational structures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Primary</field><field name="subject">Teacher Education: Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Educational Psychology</field><field name="subject">Philosophy for Children</field><field name="subject">Ethical inquiry</field><field name="subject">Community of Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Social and Environmental Education</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/51285</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37943</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Actions of seminal fluid signalling factors in the female reproductive tract and on pregnancy outcome.</field><field name="creator">Glynn, Danielle Jannette</field><field name="description">The cytokine environment of early pregnancy is known to be a key determinant of the development of the pre-implantation embryo, and its subsequent implantation and growth. Factors in male seminal fluid have been identified as regulators of the expression of cytokines in the female tract of mice, humans and other mammalian species, with insemination eliciting a cascade of molecular and cellular events, reminiscent of a classic inflammatory response. In humans, perturbations in seminal fluid signalling have been proposed to predispose to pathologies of pregnancy including implantation failure, recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia. Seminal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF&#946;) is identified as one key molecule present in seminal fluid responsible for inducing the female post-mating cytokine response in mice. Research in humans however, has shown the seminal TGF&#946; content of fertile versus infertile couples to be similar, while the content of other known seminal constituents such as interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;), correlate with reproductive success. This project aimed to investigate the nature of active factors present in seminal fluid in mice, and their interactions in regulating the uterine cytokine environment during early pregnancy, utilising a variety of in vitro and in vivo experimental strategies. Further, the effect of perturbation in the peri-conception cytokine environment on short and long term pregnancy and postnatal outcomes was investigated. Evaluation of uterine fluids from estrous and mated mice showed a marked upregulation of a number of cytokines following mating, including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the chemokine KC (rodent IL-8 homologue). Increased production of factors such as GM-CSF and subsequent generation of a receptive uterine environment is thought to be crucial for optimal embryo development and placentation. It has previously been shown that seminal factors such as TGF&#946; contribute to the uterine post-mating inflammatory response, however other moieties present in seminal fluid, for instance cytokines induced in response to infection such as IFN&#947; or products from the mucosal microflora, may also play a regulatory role. Using uterine epithelial cells cultured in vitro, it was shown that a variety of immune modulators including the cytokines TGF&#946; and IFN&#947;, as well as bacterial products, gram negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and gram positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA), can alter basal cytokine production. IFN&#947;, a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated natural killer cells and T-cells, is known to interfere with TGF&#946; signalling in other contexts. Independently TGF&#946;, LPS and LTA stimulate GM-CSF production while differentially regulating IL-6 and KC production. Conversely IFN&#947; inhibits GM-CSF production, without effecting IL-6 or KC. Pair wise combinations of TGF&#946;, LPS and LTA resulted in additive stimulation of GM-CSF, while addition of IFN&#947; to cultures in conjunction with any of these molecules downregulated GM-CSF and KC stimulation. These in vitro studies indicate factor-specific interactions between seminal fluid constituents and highlight the complex nature of seminal fluid signalling. Consequently we propose that the relative ratio of seminal signalling factors is likely to be more important than the absolute concentration of various regulators, in determining the optimal female reproductive tract response. Using the mouse as an in vivo model, I have in addition demonstrated that LPS and LTA instilled into an estrous uterus can elicit cytokine production comparable to that observed following insemination. Further, these studies have shown that IFN&#947; instilled into the uterus of a recently mated mouse can reduce the post-copulatory GM-CSF and KC surge. However administration of IFN&#947; had no effect on near term pregnancy outcomes including fetal or placental weights, fetal crown-rump length, or implantation or resorption rates. The &#8216;developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis&#8217; proposes the idea that the early uterine environment encountered by the conceptus contributes toward the risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood, hence a long term study of progeny conceived after IFN&#947; administration was also undertaken. Neo-natal outcomes, such as birth weight, litter size and gestation length were unaltered, as was growth trajectory to 22 weeks of age. Adult metabolic markers, glucose tolerance, organ weight, muscle weight, adiposity and systolic blood pressure were not affected by the perturbation of peri-conceptual cytokine parameters. This work has examined the potential regulatory role of a number of seminal fluid signalling agents in directing the post-mating cytokine response, and has furthermore shown the relatively resilient nature of the early cytokine environment to subtle perturbation. Delineating the identity and roles of seminal fluid factors in early pregnancy brings us closer to an understanding of the key physiological events of early pregnancy and assists in identifying potential risk factors for human pregnancy pathologies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seminal fluid; semen, mating, insemination; pregnancy; progeny; inflammatory; cytokines; leukocytes; IFNgamma; microflora</field><field name="subject">Generative organs, Female.</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Semen</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59018</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReFashion reDunn : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Janet</field><field name="description">This study arises out of the researcher&#8217;s experience in the fields of costume and fashion. It develops, through design practice and reflection, a design process for fashion wear made from post-consumer recycled materials. Theoretical analysis provides global, historical, philosophical and design contexts within which to develop an ethos for this variant form of fashion wear designated ReFashion. Differences in design process between conventional fashion and ReFashion are detailed to highlight the significance of provenance of materials in the light of a perceived need to slow down clothing production and consumption. This perception is informed by scientific predictions that failure to engage with urgently needed changes to the prevalent economic paradigm will result in planet earth reaching a tipping point with potentially disastrous results for its inhabitants. Fundamental to the ReFashion ethos is preparedness for a speculative post-apocalyptic future that might render the fashion system unable to operate as it currently does, necessitating a more self-sufficient approach to clothing needs, with an accompanying shift in perceptions of what is deemed fashionable. The theme Survivalist Fantasy provides a lens to bring conceptual and material aspects of the work into focus. Informed by sustainability, Survivalist Fantasy recontextualises a failure of sustainable initiatives on a global scale and their adaptation on a local scale specifically in the arena of clothing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">costume</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">recycled materials</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/711</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intended and interpreted technology curriculum in four New Zealand secondary schools : does this all mean the same? : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education, Massey University.</field><field name="creator">Bondy, Ann</field><field name="description">In 1993 a new draft technology curriculum was introduced to New Zealand schools, followed by the publication of the final document in 1995. Its design and intentions required a shift in thinking within schools, in teaching and learning, and in the wider community. This had significant implications for the way schools managed curriculum implementation, for staffing in technology, and for resourcing. Professional development opportunities, funding support and support resource material were made available over a number of years as research in this area continued. Access to this support was not consistent for teachers and schools, and in some cases, not always sought. By the time the implementation of the technology curriculum became mandatory in 1999 for all students, Years 1 &#8211; 10, anecdotal evidence and some initial research showed that its interpretation and delivery in schools was varied,or no different from that of the previous workshop focussed syllabus.  This research sets out to discover how technology education has been implemented across a small selection of schools in the Wellington region and to consider the way school management and technology staff in each school have interpreted and implemented it. Student responses to this implementation are also examined. The study draws from four secondary schools, and the focus is on senior technology as this was viewed by the researcher as a level where the interpretation and implementation of technology education could be most diverse. Changes in national assessment practices also highlighted this diversity. Each school was treated as a case study involving interviews with principals, teachers and senior students, in order to examine how technology is understood and practised. The ways in which teachers and students understood technology is examined within a framework of contemporary national and international research literature. The findings need to be considered in view of the fact that only four sites were used, the research is interpretive in nature, and makes use of case study methodology. In other words, the results cannot be directly generalised; however, readers are able to identify from the descriptions the extent to which findings transfer to their own context.  The distinctive factors that emerged from this study highlight that the teachers concerned interpreted and implemented the technology curriculum with a strong consideration of their students&#8217; backgrounds, learning needs, abilities and aspirations. In addition, the teachers&#8217; own experience and qualifications, along with contextual factors associated with the school, such as its decile rating, appeared to be linked with the teachers&#8217; interpretation of the curriculum. Teachers identified a need for ongoing, robust professional development so that they could be confident in their practice, and have a common understanding of terminology presented in the curriculum and national assessment standards. Resourcing for schools in the form of facilities, materials and staffing was varied and also needed to be supported. The study also identifies further research requirements to inform and support this curriculum area. These requirements ask for the extension of the present research to other schools, the evaluation of professional development programmes in technology, and the evaluation of the impact of school technology programmes on students&#8217; learning and students&#8217; future educational/work pathways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology curriculum</field><field name="subject">High schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/769</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the acidic protein fraction of bovine whey and its effect on bone cells : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, New Zealand EMBARGOED till 1 December 2015</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Bernadette Jane</field><field name="description">Milk is provided to new borns as their first food source and it contains essential nutrients, vitamins and other beneficial components, such as enzymes and antibodies that are required for rapid growth and development of the new born and for sustained growth over time. Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the interactions between Holstein-Friesian genotypes and feeding systems, with emphasis on system performance and cow grazing ability : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science, Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rossi, Jos&#233; Luis</field><field name="description">Imported genetic material of the Holstein-Friesian breed from overseas (OS), mainly from North America, has been used in New Zealand (NZ) since the late 1960's. This has diluted the genetic base of the former NZ Friesian genotype selected under intensive seasonal pasture-based systems. As a result, increased concerns have been raised about the negative influence of these overseas genes on the modern NZ Holstein- Friesian, as it is apparent that the OS Holstein-Friesian has a lower capacity to perform on grazed pasture. The objective of the present thesis was to investigate differences in production performance between three Holstein-Friesian genotypes farmed at different feed allowances (FA) on pasture-based systems; in addition, to investigate differences in the grazing process between strains under contrasting managements and sward conditions, and so to identify animal and pasture factors that affect the herbage intake (DMIH) and performance of the grazing cow. An accurate procedure was also established to estimate DMIH for cows fed forage and maize supplements, grazing in groups. Two modern high breeding worth (BW) Holstein-Friesian strains from NZ (NZ90) or overseas (OS90) origin and a low BW 1970's NZ Friesian genotype (NZ70) were farmed in two field experiments: (1) a long-term 'system' study that compared the yield performance of these genotypes in a range of systems with different feed allowance (FA) per cow, and a (2) a short-term 'component' study that compared the grazing capacity of the strains under contrasting sward conditions but at a common daily herbage allowance. The differences in productive performance between genotypes increased as the study progressed in the system study, with the largest observed in the last season. The mean milksolids (MS) yield per cow and per hectare were higher in NZ90 (395 kg cow-1 and 1,236 k ha-1) than in the NZ70 (336 kg cow-1 and 1,093 kg ha-1) and the OS90 (377 kg cow-1 and 1,154 kg ha-1). The higher production of NZ90 cows was supported by their higher mean daily MS yield than the NZ70 (1.45 vs. 1.21 kg MS cow-1 day-1) and more days in milk than OS90 cows (271 vs. 257 DIM). The lower lactation length of the OS90 strain occurred due to its lower body condition score (BCS) in late lactation, which determined an early dry-off for these cows. The lowest BCS of OS90 at the nadir (irrespective of FA), during lactation and at dry-off indicate these cows mobilised greater amount of body reserves and partitioned most of the energy ingested to yield. Genotype by FA interactions for milk and lactose yields, protein content in the milk and BCS were observed in the second and third seasons of the 'system' study. Milk yield increased as FA increased to a greater extent in OS90 than in the two NZ strains, whereas the content of solids in milk, particularly protein, increased to a greater extent for NZ90 than in both OS90 and NZ70. During lactation DMIH was higher for NZ90, intermediate in OS90 and lower in NZ70 (14.5, 13.9 and 12.6 kg DM cow-1 day-1 respectively for NZ90, OS90 and NZ70, as measured with nalkanes), and declined as lactation progressed, with a smaller difference for the total intake achieved (15.5, 15.2 and 13.1 kg DM cow-1 day-1 respectively) due to the increased supplement consumption. These results indicate that the OS90 needs more feed with a higher proportion of supplement in the diet to improve productive performance on pasture-based systems; the NZ90 would perform better when cow nutrition is mainly supported by grazing pasture, although further increments in performance could be expected from strategic supplementation, but requiring more feed than NZ70. The DMIH per unit of live weight (DMIH/LW) was highest in NZ90 strain in both the 'system' and in the short sward of the 'component' study (31.5 and 31.1 g DM kg-1 DM in NZ90 vs. 28.9 and 28.6 g DM kg-1 DM for OS90 in 'system' and 'component' studies respectively). The higher intake of NZ90 on pasture was sustained by a higher capacity to graze short swards than NZ70 and OS90, and to deal with the herbage of higher bulk density and lower quality present at the base of taller swards. The NZ90 can maintain DMIH in swards with different structures, indicating higher flexibility to perform under different managements and sward conditions. The size of the jaw is smaller in NZ90 than OS90 (88.4 vs. 92.4 mm) with effects on bite area and bite size, and this flexibility to adapt the size of the bite to swards of different structure may improve bite penetration under constraining sward conditions. The reduced ability of the OS90 to adjust ingestive behaviour to different swards would limit the capacity of this strain to perform on pasture. The fact that OS90 cows increased DMIH and DMIH/LW substantially in a leafy and taller sward (up to 21.6 kg cow-1 and 40.8 g DM kg-1Lw vs. 19.2 kg cow-1 and 41.0 g DM kg-1Lw in NZ90 during early lactation) suggests that yield performance can be improved in these cows even on pasture, by fine-tuning pasture management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holstein-Friesian cattle</field><field name="subject">Feed utilisation efficiency</field><field name="subject">Milk yield</field><field name="subject">Grazing</field><field name="subject">Feed</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">genotype</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1457</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Being there' when one's spouse is hospitalised in a non-local tertiary centre : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Christine Joy</field><field name="description">Illness that requires hospitalisation is a potential cause of anxiety for the entire family. Furthermore, increases in technology and specialisation of hospital services have resulted in increasing numbers of patients being transferred to centralised tertiary hospitals. There is limited international and national literature that explores the phenomenon of having one's spouse hospitalised in non-local tertiary centres. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of exploring the experiences of those whose spouses were hospitalised in non-local tertiary settings. Understanding of the experiences of 14 people affected by such hospitalisations was underpinned by a Heideggerian phenomenological perspective. Three major themes emerged from this study. Those who have their spouse hospitalised in non-local tertiary settings spend time waiting; a time best described as being-in-suspense. Despite being-in-suspense the research participants adjusted to their understanding of the situation; a period of time interpreted as fitting being out-of-town into being-in-the-world. The final theme that emerged from this study is that there were times when the research participants perceived that they were alone, unable to support or be supported by their spouses: being with and without others. Overall the findings of this research indicate that those whose spouses were hospitalised in a non-local tertiary centre lived day by day, with little or no social support, awaiting outcomes over which they had limited control. The worst potential outcome for these individuals would be that of the spouse's death in the non-local centre. When the outcomes of the non-local hospitalisation could be predicted, the events of living day by day were manageable. It also emerged from conducting this study that in living day by day, the supporting spouse dealt with the circumstances by being focussed on the temporality of the present and a vision of a positive future. However, their spouses were not always able to conceive the future in such a positive way. Nurses and other health professionals must remain cognisant of the fact that while they are familiar with the everydayness of non-local hospitalisations, [abstract incomplete].</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospital patients family relationships</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Spouses</field><field name="subject">Adjustment Psychology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1458</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing proficiency in air transport pilots : the case for the introduction on non-technical skills in basic pilot training programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD Aviation at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">De Montalk, Ritchie James</field><field name="description">This study examines the differences between the skills and competencies of New Zealand flight school graduates and the types of skills and competencies believed to define a proficient air transport pilot. In New Zealand the training of professional pilots is directed towards meeting the requirements laid down by the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority for the licensing of professional pilots. However, some evidence suggests that competence for licensing purposes does not necessarily meet the requirements of the airlines and the types of skills that they require as a prerequisite to airline training. Although not clearly defined, this shortfall has been recognised for several decades and traditional thinking is that extra flying experience gained as a general aviation pilot will develop the skills necessary for entry into airline pilot training. The importance that pilots of differing experience levels attach to technical and non-technical skills and their perception of the training effectiveness of those skills and how deficiencies in those skills contributed to aircraft accidents was explored by a four stage study including: i) a review and analysis of flight test results obtained from graduate pilots on a university air transport pilot programme; ii) the analysis of responses to questionnaires supplied to three pilot groups within the New Zealand aviation industry; iii) the analysis of air transport aircraft accidents and their primary and contributing causes; and iv) interviews with qualified airline pilots working for New Zealand airlines. The results indicated that throughout the spectrum of experience and qualifications, from student pilot to airline pilot, the technical skill of aircraft handling was highly valued and the training in this skill was considered by all pilots to be satisfactory. In contrast, while non-technical skill deficiencies were found to be primary or contributing factors in many aircraft accidents, less importance was attached to non-technical skills by all pilot groups. The training effectiveness of these skills was rated as only moderately effective or of minimal effectiveness. The findings are discussed and recommendations are made for the improvement of basic flight training. In addition, a model is proposed for the fast tracking of flight school graduates into the airline training schools. Several areas for future research are also proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air pilots training of</field><field name="subject">Flight training</field><field name="subject">Aircraft accidents</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1460</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">K&#251;kulu kauhale o limaloa : a Kanaka Maoli culture based approach to education through visual studies : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education, Massey University, College of Education</field><field name="creator">Clark, Herman Pi'ikea</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the outcome of a Kanaka Maoli culture based teacher education class initiated as a research project through the University of Hawaii in the summer of 2004.

This thesis focuses on the work of five playwrights: Bruce Mason, James K. Baxter, Mervyn Thompson, Ren&#233;e and Robert Lord, all of whom have set out to identify such a 'voice' and in so doing have brought about a metamorphosis in the nature of New Zealand drama. New Zealand has traditionally been regarded as being on 'the margin' in relation to the dominant culture of the colonizer (the Eurocentre). Before Bruce Mason began to challenge this 'centre' of power in the early 1950s, New Zealand playwrights were so intimidated by the Eurocentre that they usually set their plays in Europe, particularly in England, in order to make them acceptable to their audiences. Mason proposed that 'the margin' of New Zealand, rather than being seen as inferior, should be redefined as a fertile place capable of nurturing a new individual dramatic form quite distinct from colonial norms. All of my chosen playwrights have insisted upon the intrinsic value of a two-tiered concept of 'the margin.' By setting their plays (wherever possible) in the country of their birth, highlighting New Zealand social issues and in the process persuading theatre-going audiences that plays about this country are worth watching, they have given new life to 'the margin' (the culture of New Zealand as a whole). At the same time all of these five playwrights have recognized that minority groups - 'voices' from 'the outer margin' in relation to the Pakeha 'inner margin' of power - have been largely unrepresented or misrepresented in New Zealand plays. They have advocated the vital importance of women's 'voices,' M&#257;ori 'voices' and gay 'voices,' for example, in their exploration of a more sophisticated and inclusive understanding of what constitutes our national identity. Moreover, in a period of less than forty years, they have helped to facilitate the transition of New Zealand theatre from amateur to professional status and have been instrumental in providing the practical framework whereby future New Zealand playwrights may find an outlet for their work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand theatre</field><field name="subject">New Zealand playwrights</field><field name="subject">Minority groups in drama</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410102 Drama, theatre and performance studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1461</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'I'm not a woman writer, but--' : gender matters in New Zealand women's short fiction 1975-1995 : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in English at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Le Marquand, Jane Nicole</field><field name="description">From the late 1970s, New Zealand women short story writers increasingly worked their way into the literary mainstream. In the wake of the early, feminist-motivated years of the decade their gender, which had previously been the root of their marginalized position, began to work for them. However, rather than embracing womanhood, this growth in gender recognition led to many writers rejecting overt identification of their sex. To be a labeled a woman writer was considered patronising, a mark of inferiority. These women wanted to be known as writers only, some even expressing a hope for literature to reach a point of androgyny. Their work, however, did not convey an androgynous perspective. Just as the fact of their gender could not be avoided, so the influence their sex had on their creativity cannot be denied. Gender does matter and New Zealand women's short fiction published in the 1975-1995 period illustrates its significance. From the early trend for adopting fiction as a site for social commentary and political treatise against patriarchy's one-dimensional image of woman, these stories show a gradually increasing awareness of fictional possibilities, allowing for celebration of the multiplicity of female experience and capturing a process of redefinition rather than rejection of 'women's work'. Though in the later 1990s it may no longer have been politically 'necessary' to promote women's work on the grounds of gender, on a personal level the 'difference of view' of the woman writer remained both visible and vital. An increasing sense of woman-to-woman communication based on shared experience emerges: women are writing as women, about women, for women.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women authors</field><field name="subject">History and criticism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand literature</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Women in literature</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1462</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty in three villages in Papua : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Rumbewas, Spener</field><field name="description">The principal objective of this thesis is to explore the issue of poverty in selected research sites in Papua. This objective is broken down to four questions: how is poverty understood, how is it measured, what are its causes and how is it alleviated? Two approaches were utilised to investigate the above questions. Macro level investigation was based on exploring data available in the official publications while the micro approach was based on fieldwork carried out in the selected sites. The results of the first approach are examined in chapters two, three and four, and the second approach are discussed in chapter five, six, seven and eight. In relation to the first question, the macro exploration found that poverty is understood mainly in terms of a lack of basic components of life such as income, consumption or basic needs. Understanding poverty from this approach normally uses the poverty line, which is set up based on these items, to separate the poor from the non-poor. According to this line, poverty refers to those people whose consumption falls below the line while the rest are non-poor. This view looks at poverty from one dimension that is an economic dimension. Hence, it does not provide a complete picture of human poverty, which covers not only the economic dimension but also others such as vulnerability, powerlessness, isolation, and a lack of choice. The micro investigation adopts a poverty understanding stemming from the experience of the poor. This investigation found that the poor understand poverty from what they feel to be lacking in their environment. In this approach, poverty is a lack of assets, in particular natural, physical, human, social and financial assets. Nonetheless, those affected by poverty argue that their poverty is not related to nature, but to physical, human, social and financial assets. This view seems to offer a broader picture of human poverty and hence, it is useful for formulation of or as a basis for a poverty reduction policy. With regard to the second question, the macro approach found that poverty measurement employs a quantitative measurement of both items and methods. The quantitative items can include income, consumption or basic needs (food and non-food), which are valued in monetary terms. The quantitative methods apply statistical techniques such as headcount index, poverty gap index, poverty severity index and others to measure poverty. This measurement only considers the quantitative aspect and, therefore, it does not pay attention to the qualitative aspect of human poverty. The micro approach on the other hand, attempts to amalgamate both aspects into a poverty measurement. One of the approaches that attempts an amalgamation of the two is the participatory approach, which is utilised in this study. Although it is a qualitative-based approach, it still opens the window to the use of quantitative approaches. The micro approach seems to offer some benefits such as giving more depth of information regarding human poverty, directly touching the lives of the poor, and facilitating a bottom-up policy to alleviate poverty in the local context. In the third question, the macro exploration demonstrates that structural forces such as agents, class and institutions bring about poverty through their policies, programmes and rules. The micro investigation on the other hand, shows that individual characteristics and a lack of assets contribute to poverty. This investigation sees that poverty at the micro level is a result of the mutual operation of structural forces, individual characteristics and a lack of assets. With regard to the last question, both approaches demonstrate a variety of polices to eliminate poverty as discussed in chapters three, six, seven, eight and ten. One framework for a poverty reduction strategy is the Asian Development Bank (ABD) three pillars strategy: social development, pro-poor growth and good governance. However the emphasis is for government commitment and the political will to alleviate poverty. Some experts underline this as a prerequisite to implement a poverty reduction policy because, as they argue, without this the policy will either not exist or will develop only very slowly. The selected sites experienced poor environments in terms of infrastructure, poor education and skills, poor health and nutrition. This is indeed a manifestation of poor government policies as identified by the poor. From the poor's point of view, it was found that all participants in the fieldwork identified poor policy as a contributing factor of poverty they experienced. This was also justified by looking at the ranking of institutions they gave. In these rankings, government institutions were generally given a rank of less importance by the poor. Participants stated that these institutions were not trusted and were not effective in providing support to the poor.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty reduction</field><field name="subject">Government policy</field><field name="subject">Poor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370404 Economic geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1463</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purpose, practice and power : a study of power in the work of seven heads of field offices in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tait, Edna</field><field name="description">Interest in the power of heads of field offices in the United Nations Organization (UN) began with the researcher's appointment to such a position and with anecdotal suggestions that any explanation of the powers they held would be complex. For these reasons, this study has the research aim of explaining the power of some UN heads of field offices. The study focusses on seven heads of field offices in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Literature searches indicated that no academic study had been made of any UN field work but the searches produced considerable literature on the UN and a wide range of theories about organizations, leadership and power, related issues of ethics and rationality and useful concepts from the work of Weber and Foucault. The research is interpretive. A case study and an appropriate conceptual framework were designed to reflect both the literature and the three research questions that promote the aim: organizational bureaucracy, organizational capital and frontline work are the guiding concepts. Because case studies may be challenged for possible lack of rigour and for validity, a number of data collection and analysis methods were used to promote reliability: both the data sources and the analysis checks included participants, UNESCO documents and information from other international bodies. Appropriate literature is also used for theoretical analysis. The results are presented progressively in three chapters, each chapter focussing on one framework concept and its appropriate question. The relevant data are presented and theoretical analysis, including selected concepts from Weber and Foucault, suggests answers to each question posed. The research results suggest that in the organization the participants gain power from UNESCO's intellectual and ethical purpose but are constrained in its use by processes of the bureaucracy, especially its lines of communication. The participants also have considerable power in organizational capital that includes tangible capital of qualifications, experience, skills, high level of position, the resources of the post in which they work and the intangible capital of the assumptions they hold about their work. At the frontline, although constrained by bureaucratic processes that limit their time for programme work, participants report valuable contributions to UNESCO's development and advocacy work: they gain power fiom proximity to the countries they serve and from their ethical motivation. They also gain some power in the freedom of distance from their headquarters, thus weakening the possible double jeopardy by being in a class-at-the-frontline and being in a group-not-in-headquarters. The final chapter brings all suggestions together and examines participants' power for sources (as rights or capacities), limitations (as control or domination) and agency (with compliance and resistance); when these perspectives are combined in a circle of power, the study suggests a Janus syndrome in which participants paradoxically are powerful/powerless agents, sited as they are between the power provision and constraints of both their bureaucracy and the governments and other bodies with whom they work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United Nations field offices</field><field name="subject">UNESCO</field><field name="subject">Organisational bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">Organisational capital</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than one way to catch a frog: a study of children&#8217;s discourse in an Australian contact language</field><field name="creator">Disbray, Samantha</field><field name="description">Children everywhere learn to tell stories. One important aspect of story telling is the way characters are introduced and then moved through the story. Telling a story to a na&#239;ve listener places varied demands on a speaker. As the story plot develops, the speaker must set and re-set these parameters for referring to characters, as well as the temporal and spatial parameters of the story. To these cognitive and linguistic tasks is the added social and pragmatic task of monitoring the knowledge and attention states of their listener. The speaker must ensure that the listener can identify the characters, and so must anticipate their listener&#8217;s knowledge and on-going mental image of the story. How speakers do this depends on cultural conventions and on the resources of the language(s) they speak.

Both 'language' and 'maintenance' need to be defined, and in doing so I suggest that we need something other than a structuralist notion of language. I distinguish two uses of the term 'language maintenance': (a) the activity of a group of speakers, usually described by linguists in terms of causes of maintenance, numbers of speakers over generations and so on; and (b) maintenance as an interventional practice, the approach that is favoured in this work.

Firstly (Chapter 4), the role of photorefractoriness to long daily photoperiods in the initiation of the seasonal reproductive activity in breeding red deer hinds was examined. Red deer hinds (n=10) were prematurely exposed to a long daily photoperiod of 15.3 h from 22 July to 8 November 1986 i.e. winter-spring (EPW), or maintained under natural photoperiods (NP). Six hinds experienced the natural changes in daily photoperiod until mid-summer but were exposed to a 15.5 h of light each day from 30 January to 30 April 1987, i.e. summer-autumn (EPS), whilst hinds in the other groups experienced naturally decreasing daily photoperiods. On 5 occasions (July 1986, January, February, March and April 1987), blood samples were collected from 4 NP and 4 EPW hinds every 20 minutes for 4 h to monitor secretion of luteinising hormone and half hourly for another 4 h following an i.v. injection of 2 &#181;g GnRH to measure pituitary responsiveness. In January, March and April 1987 EPS hinds were also intensively sampled for 4 h. Plasma progesterone concentrations and mean date of calving indicated that the onset of breeding activity was not affected by light treatment in the EPW hinds but was delayed by 3 weeks in the EPS hinds. In contrast, supplementary lighting caused a premature elevation of plasma prolactin concentrations and advanced pelage moulting in EPW hinds only. Plasma LH secretion patterns indicated that LH pulse frequency and mean LH concentrations were greater during the breeding season than during pregnancy or, seasonal or postpartum, anoestrus. The reduction in LH secretion was partially explained by a diminished pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. Daily plasma melatonin secretion patterns indicated that the duration of the nocturnal increase in melatonin concentrations was responsive to changes in photoperiod and provided a suitable endocrine signal for measuring day length. The results suggest that, unlike the sheep and prepubertal red deer hind, the onset of seasonal breeding activity in breeding red deer hinds is not affected by long daily photoperiods in spring but is delayed if the autumnal decrease in daily photoperiod is delayed. Therefore neither the development of photorefractoriness nor the spring increase in daily photoperiods initiated the transition from seasonal anoestrus to reproductive activity in the breeding hind. However, long daily photoperiods may have entrained the annual cycle of pelage shedding and prolactin secretion. It is possible that the neuroendocrine pathway by which photoperiodic signals entrain the seasonal cycle of reproduction is separate from those which regulate other seasonal events in the breeding red deer hind.  Secondly (Chapter 5), in a study of seasonality of reproduction, 4 pubertal hinds were monitored for live weight and plasma LH and progesterone concentrations from December 1987 to October 1988 (i.e. 12-22 months of age). In addition the pattern of LH secretion was also studied in 4 ovariectomised pubertal hinds implanted s.c. with controlled release implants containing 12 mg oestradiol-17&#946; between 4 March and 25 May and between 15 June and 19 September, 1988. On several occasions (15 December, 29 February, 15 March, 24 April, 14 June, 29 June, 18 September (all hinds) and 3 October (ovariectomised hinds only) blood samples were collected every 20 minutes for 4 h to monitor secretion of luteinising hormone and following an i.v. injection of 2 &#181;g GnRH to measure pituitary responsiveness. Plasma progesterone profiles indicated that 4-6 ovarian cycles, lasting about 19 d each, occurred in each intact hind. Regular ovarian cycles commenced in late April (26 April &#177; 3.4 d, mean &#177; s.e.m.) and ceased 3 months later in July (21 July &#177; 7.2 d). The number of LH pulses in the intact hinds was higher in June (1-2 pulses/4 h) than in the non-breeding season (&lt; 1 pulse/4 h) probably due to a seasonal increase in GnRH secretion. It appears that the seasonal increase in LH pulsatility and onset of reproductive activity in the entire hinds were temporally related to a reduction in the sensitivity of LH secretion to the negative feedback effects of oestradiol in ovariectomised pubertal hinds.  In the third trial (Chapter 6), 20 male and 20 female red deer calves were immunised at birth against a melatonin conjugate or injected with adjuvant only (controls). Booster injections were given on 5 occasions over the next 2 years. Stags which produced significant melatonin binding activity in response to immunisation, were heavier than the controls between 7 and 11 months of age and at 16, 20, 30 and 34 months of age. A similar but smaller effect on live weight was seen in the immunised hinds. Immunisation against melatonin did not affect the calving date of the hinds or antler development and time of casting of antlers in the stags. These results indicated that disruption of the photoperiodic signal by immunisation against melatonin may have prevented the entrainment of annual rhythms in feed intake and growth but without affecting the seasonal cycles in antler growth and ovarian activity.  Finally in a series of 3 trials (Chapter 7), anoestrous red deer hinds were induced to ovulate with the GnRH analogue, buserelin. Hinds were pre-treated with intravaginal devices containing 0.6 g progesterone (CIDR-Type S) for 14 days prior to CIDR withdrawal on 4 March. In Year 1, 15 hinds were treated with 1 CIDR each and 8 hinds were injected i.m. with 4 &#181;g buserelin (a GnRH analogue) at CIDR removal followed by 2nd injection of 10 &#181;g 48 h later. In Year 2, 16 hinds were treated with 2 CIDRs each and 8 hinds were injected Lm. with 4, 3, 2, 2 and 10 &#181;g buserelin at -48, -24, 0, 24 and 48 h respectively from CIDR withdrawal. In Year 3, 15 hinds were treated with 2 CIDRs and 11 hinds (Groups Band BO) injected with buserelin identical to the protocol in Year 2. At CIDR withdrawal 6 of these buserelin treated hinds (Group BO) and 4 other progesterone-primed hinds (Group 0) were injected with 500 &#181;g oestradiol benzoate. In addition, during the breeding season, 4 hinds (Group C) were treated with double CIDRs only for 14 d from 1 April. When oestrous behaviour and the pattern of plasma LH secretion were monitored in Year 3, oestrous behaviour was less noticeable and delayed in Group B hinds and peak LH levels were lower and increased later relative to Group 0, BO and C hinds. Two weeks after CIDR withdrawal, 6 buserelin-treated hinds in both Year 1 and Year 2, and 3/5 B, 2/4 0, 3/6 BO and 4/4 C group hinds in Year 3 had a single corpus luteum present. Plasma progesterone concentrations were elevated for about 12 d in most hinds with a corpus luteum in Year 2 and in most B, BO and C Group hinds in Year 3. However, progesterone secretion was low in several Year 1 and all Group 0 hinds in Year 3 indicating that the induced corpora lutea in these hinds were functionally subnormal. There was no evidence that any of the buserelin-induced ovulations resulted in pregnancy, probably because the induced ovulations were not accompanied by normal hormonal and behavioural patterns. The experiments described in this thesis have contributed to our understanding of the regulation of seasonal breeding in red deer hinds.

Yunus</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to broaden our understanding of the determinants of joint venture performance in the context of a developing country. After a comprehensive review of past studies is presented, highlighting the focus of contemporary research on international joint venture, a conceptual model is presented for studying the determinants of joint venture performance. A number of hypotheses which focuses on the relationships between joint venture performance measures and various organisational, strategic, managerial, industry-related, and country-related factors are developed. The impact of these factors on joint venture success and stability is then analysed using multivariate analysis. While measurement methods of past studies are adopted in several cases, new measures are developed for the measurement of a number of determinants (viz., resource complementarity and psychic distance).The empirical analysis uses data collected from 59 international joint ventures involving local partners and Developed and Developing country multinational companies in Bangladesh. A descriptive analysis of the preliminary results of the study is followed by bivariate and multivariate analyses. In general, the results of the bivariate analysis tend to support the posited hypotheses for half of the variables of this study. Multivariate analysis reveals that joint venture experience of the parents, the extent of complementarity of contributed resources, the extent of cooperation between parent firms, and export orientation of the joint venture have significant positive impact on success. Mature technology tend to influence success better than the sophisticated technology. The degree of cooperation between parent firms tend to determine joint venture stability. Psychic distance between parents is also a likely predictor of joint venture stability but, the influence is relatively weak.The exploratory analysis of the joint ventures of Developed and Developing country multinational companies reveals that these two groups of joint ventures are significantly different in terms of parents' firm size, multinational spread and joint venture experience, as well as the nature of technology they use, the market cater for, and the level of psychic distance between parents' country of origin. Despite these differences, these two groups of joint ventures did not perform differently.  Implications of the research findings are discussed. Finally, the limitations of this study are considered and possible directions for further research outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3089</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flow properties and design procedures for coal storage bins</field><field name="creator">Moore, B. A.</field><field name="description">The handling and storage of black coal has always presented industry with problems of erratic or spasmodic feed, partial reclamation of the total contents of bins and flow blockages at hopper outlets. These problems can lead to extreme cost penalties for all users, from the coal producers and export market loading facilities to the secondary industries using coal for process energy requirements. Any reduction in the occurrence of these handling problems and the subsequent increase in efficiency would be of benefit. The aim of this work was to investigate two major aspects in the design of coal storage bins to ensure reliable and predictable operation, particularly in regard to gravity assisted discharge. First an experimental study investigated the flow properties of black coal and the influence on these flow properties of variations in the physical characteristics of the test samples. Variables considered included moisture content, particle top size of test samples, coal particle shape, time consolidation at rest and ash content. Samples for the test program were obtained from the six collieries located in the Southern Coalfields (Illawarra Measures) of the Sydney Basin of New South Wales. The coals ranged in rank from sub-bituminous to semi-anthracite.The study highlighted the most influential variables to be moisture content, sample particle size and time consolidation at rest.  Other factors such as particle shape, coal rank and ash content were minor considerations. Often a variation of variable affected other properties and led to decreased sample flowability. A common example was that of coals with a high friability; this leads to greater particle degradation and generation of fines with handling operations, which then leads to higher moisture retention capabilities and significantly large critical arching dimensions, particularly with time storage.The flow property testing program utilised a Jenike - type Direct Shear Tester for the coal sample shear testing. To improve the consistency of this instrument, and eliminate operator and test data interpretation related errors a standardised testing procedure was developed. The second aspect of investigation dealt with the design procedures for the determination of mass flow hopper geometries based on the coal flow properties and utilising the well accepted theories of Jenike. A novel method of design data presentation was developed which links the flow properties and the hopper geometry parameters. This was achieved by presenting all parameters as a function of a common independent variable, the major consolidation stress. This approach has advantages in accounting for experimental error in the flow properties and for the determination of hopper geometries that have design constraints.The hopper design procedures were further advanced by the development of an alternate presentation of the original Jenike flow factor charts .These alternative charts have been abbreviated to display only the critical design values in the border region between mass flow and funnel flow. The charts eliminate the need for imprecise parameter interpolations by displaying the required design parameters in the form of contours of constant wall slope and flow factor as a function of the effective angle of internal friction and kinematic angle of wall friction.These new concepts were combined to allow the generation of manual hopper geometry design nomograms or worksheets. This design presentation represents a compact and rapid method for the determination of mass flow hopper geometry parameters for axisymmetric and plane flow outlets.The influence and sensitivity of the coal sample variations was explored further by determining the hopper geometry parameters of wall slope and outlet dimension based on the respective flow properties. This has allowed standardised hopper design guidelines to be formulated. An important aspect highlighted by this study was the significant role of wall friction in achieving a successful design.In consideration of the design procedures for bulk solid storage, computer software was developed and implemented for the computer aided design of storage bins. Two programs were developed, the first, to aid in the rapid processing and analysis of experimental flow property data, describing the flow properties by empirical equations and graphically. The second program utilised the empirical flow property equations for the determination of critical hopper geometry parameters and the generation of other design graphs. The programs operate both on a mainframe computer and a microcomputer, and utilise interactive execution and high resolution graphics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1580</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Lipase from pseudomonas fluorescens was selected as the model enzyme. Covalent binding protocol (CVB) with a polyethyleneimine (PEI) spacer and glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linker was used as benchmark protocol. It was found that lipases could be effectively immobilized onto woollen cloth by the benchmark CVB protocol. The immobilized activity was independent of the GA concentration and soaking time in the GA solution, but dependent on the GA solution pH (optimal at pH 9). The treatment time in lipase solution was found to be the rate-determining step in the immobilization: the immobilized activity increased steadily within 5 to 10 hours of soaking in lipase solution, after that, the increase plateaued to a maximum of 4 &#956;mol pNPP.min-1. (g cloth)-1. The immobilized lipase was reasonably stable: when the immobilized cloth was stored in 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 8.5) for more than 80 days in a refrigerator, more than 80% of the lipase activity remained. The optimum pH for both free and immobilized lipase is approximately the same, which may indicate that microenvironment for the free and immobilised lipase was not considerably different. The Michaelis Menten parameters for the free and immobilized lipase were determined: KM and vmax for the free and immobilized lipase were 2.40, 3.16 mM and 153.76, 5.16 &#956;mol pNPP.min-1 (mg lipase)-1 respectively. The lipase-immobilized cloth exhibited excellent oily stain removal ability: after being stained with olive oil and stored for one day in air at room temperature, the oily stain could be easily removed by 0.05 M pH 8.5 Tris buffer without any detergent addition. This enhanced cleaning was stable also, after cloth was stored in air for almost one month, similar cleaning performance was still observed. Despite the successfulness in the benchmark CVB method, it was found to be a challenge to further improve the immobilised activity by variation of the CVB protocol and using different cross-linkers, although the ESEM images and measurement of protein load showed there was potential to do so. This was probably due to the fact that there are a number of reactive groups on wool surface which are not very reactive with the cross-linker used, thereby reducing the extent of surface activation, resulting in limited immobilized activity. To further reduce the lipase deactivation during immobilization, immobilization of the lipase via assistance of another enzyme was tried in order to eliminate the use of GA. Thus, lipase was ii entrapped inside a casein gel formed on woollen cloth in the presence of Transglutaminase (mTGase). Lipases were successfully immobilized by this protocol. Unavoidable lipase leakage and high mass transfer resistance from the casein gel however made this protocol not very promising compared to the CVB benchmark protocol. The benchmark CVB immobilization protocol was also applied to galactosidase. The overall performance of the immobilized galactosidase was poor compared to the lipase however. This may indicate that the CVB immobilization method used is not immediately transferable to other enzymes and that modifications are required to do so. Further investigation is therefore needed. Overall, the results from this project have shown that it is feasible to immobilize enzymes onto woollen cloth, although surface treatment of the wool to produce more binding groups would improve the surface coverage.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5786</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of hatha yoga on birth outcomes of first-time mothers in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moore, Sharon Dee</field><field name="description">Yoga is an ancient health practice that provides integrated control and harmonious balance through a practice of postures, muscle contractions, controlled breathing, and meditation. Although yoga has been popularized in New Zealand as a complementary, nontraditional physical fitness regime for pregnant women, little is known empirically about the safety and effectiveness of yoga during pregnancy. The primary aim of this natural history study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of antenatal yoga for first-time mothers in New Zealand. This study investigated how first-time mothers who participated in yoga (N=34) performed across a range of antenatal and postnatal measures, taken during their third trimester of pregnancy (Time 1: T1) and at three months postpartum (Time 2; T2), when compared with first-time mothers who did not participate in yoga (N=37). An additional aim of the study was to attempt to predict birth type from the above measures. Measures assessed demographic factors (T1), antenatal pain medication preferences (T1) and utilisation of pain relief during labour (T2), physical activity levels (T1, T2), complementary therapy utilisation (T1), maternal mood (T1, T2), social networks (T1, T2), maternal self-efficacy (T2), and labour experience and birth outcomes (T2). Those in the yoga group reported greater satisfaction with their diet, used a greater number of complementary therapies, had a preference for significantly less analgesia during labour, and were less likely to be prescribed bedrest or require an episiotomy compared to those in the nonyoga group. The two groups did not differ significantly on other antenatal or postnatal measures. Among a number of significant correlates of birth outcomes for the group as a whole, natural birth was associated with having a midwife or GP as lead maternity carer, shorter labour durations, less utilisation of analgesia, and more tearing. Heavier birth weights were associated with greater use of complimentary therapies, dietary supplements, longer labours and greater maternal depression and overall mood disturbance three months postpartum when compared with women who had children with lower birth weight. Higher 1-minute Apgar scores were associated with higher consumption of dietary supplements during pregnancy, while higher 5- Hatha Yoga and Birth Outcomes in New Zealand ii minute Apgar scores were associated with lower anger / hostility and working antenatally. Maternal factors which significantly predicted vaginal versus cesarean delivery and medical versus natural delivery were, participation in antenatal yoga, levels of complementary therapy utilisation, self-rating of diet, maternal age, and level of analgesia utilised during labour. When these variables were considered individually, level of analgesia utilised during labour, self-reported diet and maternal age significantly predicted natural versus medical delivery. However, of the aforementioned maternal variables, only level of analgesia utilised during labour significantly predict medical (i.e., casearean and operative births) versus natural birth. This study of antenatal yoga among first-time mothers in the Auckland region of New Zealand found the practice of antenatal yoga to be safe and associated with a number of benefits. However, before the practice of antenatal yoga can be recommended, a larger randomized control study is warranted. Future research in this field should also investigate the influence and practice of antenatal yoga among women from socially and ethnically diverse populations, including those residing outside of main urban centres.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5797</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing on the Loose: Reading Florian Illies's Generation golf, Maurice G.

Dantec, Mein langer Lauf zu mir selbst (1999) by Joschka Fischer, and Windows on the World (2003) by Fre&#769;de&#769;ric Beigbeder; and in so doing it demonstrates that these two German and two French authors combine belletrist endeavours with critical socio-political arguments in a way that corresponds to the literary form which Anglo-American writers refer to as 'creative nonfiction'. In particular, it shows that the authors recognisably share the desire to pull together critical social commentary in nonfiction form with the moral and aesthetic enterprise of the modern novelist. Current scholarship appreciates hybrid forms such as literary journalism, autofiction, nonfiction novels because they raise important formal, ethical and ontological questions. However, while they evaluate the relationship between fact and fiction in contemporary French and German writing of this kind, most scholars separate questions regarding the social merits of a text from its literary ones. This thesis adopts the creative nonfiction approach because it recognises that hybrid forms assume sharp, socio-literary positions. It defines creative nonfiction in the form of seven dynamics, which identify the distinct literary techniques that the authors use as a means to reject the constraints of weary intellectual conventions. Looking at these texts through the pluralist lens of creative nonfiction reveals that they make useful contributions to our understanding of the relationship between nonfiction and culture. Through their factual accuracy, these texts become acute documents of history and, through their literary versatility, they surpass the imaginative constraints of fact - hence this study carries the title 'Writing on the Loose'. Hybrid forms remind us that truth is an elusive concept and creative nonfiction invites us to consider this elusiveness as a valuable resource which allows us to re-imagine ourselves and our social communities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5803</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality effect in the design of adaptive e-learning systems : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information System at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Al-Dujaily, Amal</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis is a theoretical and practical study concerning the user model for adaptive e-learning systems. The research activity is two-fold. It firstly explores the personality aspect in the user model which has been overlooked in the previous literature on the design of adaptive e-learning systems, in order to see whether learners with different types of personality would have different effects on their learning performance with adaptive e-learning systems. And secondly, it investigates how to embody the personality features in the current user model, proposing that the inclusion of the personality in the user model for adaptive e-learning systems would lead to better learning performance. The thesis has considered the personality aspect in four parts. PART I reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on adaptive e-learning systems from which the main research questions are constructed. It explains how this study derives an overarching model for the inclusion of personality type in effective e-learning systems. PART II consists of the experiments, which explore empirically the importance of identifying the personality in the user model for adaptive e-learning and its effect in individual learning. That is, the main theme of the thesis hypothesises that different personality type&#8217;s influence performance with e-learning systems. PART III shows the effects of personality type on groups of learners performing collaborative learning activities. It suggests practical implications of designing collaborative learning technologies in conjunction with the personality feature. Finally, PART IV includes personality in the proposed user model and tests the primary hypothesis that &#8220;the personality may influence the learning performance of students using adaptive e-learning systems&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">instructional systems</field><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/668</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReFashion reDunn : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Janet</field><field name="description">This study arises out of the researcher&#8217;s experience in the fields of costume and fashion. It develops, through design practice and reflection, a design process for fashion wear made from post-consumer recycled materials. Theoretical analysis provides global, historical, philosophical and design contexts within which to develop an ethos for this variant form of fashion wear designated ReFashion. Differences in design process between conventional fashion and ReFashion are detailed to highlight the significance of provenance of materials in the light of a perceived need to slow down clothing production and consumption. This perception is informed by scientific predictions that failure to engage with urgently needed changes to the prevalent economic paradigm will result in planet earth reaching a tipping point with potentially disastrous results for its inhabitants. Fundamental to the ReFashion ethos is preparedness for a speculative post-apocalyptic future that might render the fashion system unable to operate as it currently does, necessitating a more self-sufficient approach to clothing needs, with an accompanying shift in perceptions of what is deemed fashionable. The theme Survivalist Fantasy provides a lens to bring conceptual and material aspects of the work into focus. Informed by sustainability, Survivalist Fantasy recontextualises a failure of sustainable initiatives on a global scale and their adaptation on a local scale specifically in the arena of clothing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">costume</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">recycled materials</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/711</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intended and interpreted technology curriculum in four New Zealand secondary schools : does this all mean the same? : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education, Massey University.</field><field name="creator">Bondy, Ann</field><field name="description">In 1993 a new draft technology curriculum was introduced to New Zealand schools, followed by the publication of the final document in 1995. Its design and intentions required a shift in thinking within schools, in teaching and learning, and in the wider community. This had significant implications for the way schools managed curriculum implementation, for staffing in technology, and for resourcing. Professional development opportunities, funding support and support resource material were made available over a number of years as research in this area continued. Access to this support was not consistent for teachers and schools, and in some cases, not always sought. By the time the implementation of the technology curriculum became mandatory in 1999 for all students, Years 1 &#8211; 10, anecdotal evidence and some initial research showed that its interpretation and delivery in schools was varied,or no different from that of the previous workshop focussed syllabus.  This research sets out to discover how technology education has been implemented across a small selection of schools in the Wellington region and to consider the way school management and technology staff in each school have interpreted and implemented it. Student responses to this implementation are also examined. The study draws from four secondary schools, and the focus is on senior technology as this was viewed by the researcher as a level where the interpretation and implementation of technology education could be most diverse. Changes in national assessment practices also highlighted this diversity. Each school was treated as a case study involving interviews with principals, teachers and senior students, in order to examine how technology is understood and practised. The ways in which teachers and students understood technology is examined within a framework of contemporary national and international research literature. The findings need to be considered in view of the fact that only four sites were used, the research is interpretive in nature, and makes use of case study methodology. In other words, the results cannot be directly generalised; however, readers are able to identify from the descriptions the extent to which findings transfer to their own context.  The distinctive factors that emerged from this study highlight that the teachers concerned interpreted and implemented the technology curriculum with a strong consideration of their students&#8217; backgrounds, learning needs, abilities and aspirations. In addition, the teachers&#8217; own experience and qualifications, along with contextual factors associated with the school, such as its decile rating, appeared to be linked with the teachers&#8217; interpretation of the curriculum. Teachers identified a need for ongoing, robust professional development so that they could be confident in their practice, and have a common understanding of terminology presented in the curriculum and national assessment standards. Resourcing for schools in the form of facilities, materials and staffing was varied and also needed to be supported. The study also identifies further research requirements to inform and support this curriculum area. These requirements ask for the extension of the present research to other schools, the evaluation of professional development programmes in technology, and the evaluation of the impact of school technology programmes on students&#8217; learning and students&#8217; future educational/work pathways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology curriculum</field><field name="subject">High schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/769</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informative ornament: &#8216;The machine&#8217; : enhancing the communicative potential of colour : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design in Illustration at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Malcolm, Sabrina Barkley</field><field name="description">Accompanying workbook not available in digital format</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Illustration</field><field name="subject">Colour-blind</field><field name="subject">Visual communication design</field><field name="subject">Patterned colour</field><field name="subject">Wordless picture books</field><field name="subject">Fantasy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410202 Fine arts studies (incl. sculpture and painting)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1465</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spinal analgesic interaction between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor systems : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Science, Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lizarraga-Madrigal, Ignacio</field><field name="description">Activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors stimulates cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide pathways. Compounds that block the activity of these NMDA receptor systems reduce pain hypersensitivity. However, their usefulness is limited by the side effects they produce. One way of reducing side effects is by combining drugs that produce the same overt effect by different mechanisms, which hopefully increase the net effect. In these series of studies, drugs that interact with NMDA receptor systems and their combinations were screened in vitro to identify spinal antinociceptive synergistic combinations that could be assessed in vivo. Based on developmental changes in thresholds, conduction velocities and blocking actions of the local anaesthetic lignocaine in neonatal rat L4/L5 dorsal root potentials, it was decided to use spinal cord in vitro preparation from 5- to 7-day-old rat pups. In single drug studies, the NMDA receptor channel blocker ketamine (1-50 &#181;M) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketoprofen (200-600 &#181;M), but not the NSAID salicylate (1000 &#181;M) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N&#969;-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 1-100 &#181;M), reduced spinal NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Ketamine also depressed non-NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Using isobolographic and composite additive line analyses, fixed-ratio combinations of ketamine and ketoprofen, ketamine and L-NAME, and ketopofen and L-NAME synergistically depressed NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. The two former combinations had a subadditive effect on non-NMDA receptor-mediated transmission, and the latter had no significant effect. These studies identified that all combinations synergistically reduced both nociceptive transmission and potential side effects. In free-moving sheep implanted with indwelling cervical intrathecal catheters, 100 &#181;1 subdural administration of ketamine (25-400 &#181;M) and ketoprofen (200-3200 &#181;M) alone and in a fixed-ratio combination (873.95-3350.78 &#181;M, 0.045:0.955) did not raise nociceptive thresholds as assessed by mechanical stimulation of one foreleg. Subdural administration of NMDA (2 mM) decreased mechanical nociceptive thresholds, and this was prevented by the highest concentrations of ketamine and ketoprofen alone and in combination. These findings demonstrated that NMDA receptor channel blockers and NSAIDs alone or in combination had no direct hypoalgesic effects when given onto the spinal cord of sheep, but they prevented NMDA-induced pain hypersensitivity. Simultaneous blockade of NMDA receptor systems could have important clinical implications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spinal anesthesia</field><field name="subject">Spinal anaesthesia</field><field name="subject">Nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory agents</field><field name="subject">Veterinary chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300502 Anaesthesiology and intensive care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1466</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature and dynamics of collaborative writing in a Malaysian tertiary ESL setting : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Linguistics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fung, Yong Mei</field><field name="description">This classroom-based study provides insights into the nature of collaborative writing in a Malaysian tertiary ESL setting. It tracked the collaborative writing processes of three case study groups over one semester and elicited students' reflections on their collaborative experience. The study focussed on three case study groups formed by nine undergraduates who were enrolled in an academic writing course in a large public university in Malaysia. The individuals volunteered to be involved in the study and they self-selected their group members. Multiple research instruments were used for data collection. The primary data was comprised of audio and video-recordings of the case studies' collaborative writing sessions over three writing tasks. Interviews, journal entries, and a questionnaire supplemented the primary data. The use of various techniques ensured that data collection was sufficiently covered in breadth and in depth. Results showed that the collaborative writing process was a complex phenomenon. The nature of collaboration is influenced by group composition, role flexibility, and task complexity. The findings reveal that familiarity with group members is crucial for group cohesion; it provided a safe and comfortable working environment. Flexibility in role-taking also helped the groups to carry out their collaboration effectively. Leader, contributor, and gate-keeper roles were interchangeable across groups and across tasks except for the scribe role. It was found that as tasks increased in complexity, conflict also intensified. During negotiations and resolutions of conflicts, the students had considered cultural issues, such as sensitivity to face and group harmony. Other affective factors such as cooperation, willingness to share, team spirit, and tolerance aided the collaboration while apathy and domineering behaviour were detrimental. These multiple factors, which differed from one case study to another, shaped the distinctiveness of each group. Nonetheless, findings from the students' transcripts and personal reflections revealed that group collaboration changed and became more positive over time. This study provides a revised definition of collaborative writing. The three case study groups shared some common features, such as mutual interactions, sharing of expertise, conflict, and use of colloquial sentence particles. However, there were other features which were peculiar to each group, namely, self-questioning talk, use of local language, creative use of language, and humour. These features not only mediated the writing processes, but also expanded the students' knowledge construction and language acquisition. Based on the analyses, a number of implications have been drawn regarding the use of collaborative writing in the classroom. The study culminates with several recommendations for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English as a second language</field><field name="subject">English language study and teaching foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Group work in education</field><field name="subject">Authorship collaboration</field><field name="subject">Academic writing study and teaching foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420105 English as a second language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1467</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bearing in mind : birth, fathers, ritual, and 'reproductive consciousness' in transpersonal anthropological perspective : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lahood, Gregg</field><field name="description">Bearing in Mind: Birth, Fathers, Ritual, and 'Reproductive Consciousness' in Transpersonal Anthropological Perspective is an exploration of 'unusual' psychospiritual experiences among a small group of procreative fathering males in New Zealand and the viewing of these experiences through a transpersonal anthropological lens. I have used the transpersonal literature and the anthropological record, coupled with fieldwork among contemporary males to explore some of their more 'non-ordinary' responses to childbirth, paying close attention to the symbolic and therapeutic dimension implicated in their participation The term 'non-ordinary' pertains to NOSC or non ordinary states of consciousness (see glossary). Frequently their narratives suggest psychological encounters with death and transpersonal states of consciousness. This research examines these states of consciousness, the broad cultural context from which they arise and their relationship to birthing. Two basic themes are explored: 1) the social shaping of birth as a transpersonal event and ritual at the time fathers joined their partners in birthing during the late 1960s, and 2) an investigation of the transpersonal experience itself. Such phenomena have wide anthropological ramifications which opens a third theme for exploration: the possible parallels with more traditional, shamanistic, and/or indigenous midwifery and obstetrical manoeuvres (and therefore religion) &#8211; these parallels will be outlined and explored. This thesis relies heavily on a reinterpretation of the transpersonal and anthropological literature; however it is the fieldwork (gathering birth stories from men and women) that is crucial because it is the transpersonal content of their stories that drives the theoretical component.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Childbirth social aspects</field><field name="subject">Fatherhood social aspects</field><field name="subject">Fathers</field><field name="subject">Birth stories</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1468</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's perceptions of violence : the nature, extent, and impact of their experiences : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Hokowhitu Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carroll-Lind, Janis</field><field name="description">Perceptions of increased rates of violence worldwide have heightened the need to understand what children think about their experiences as victims or witnesses of violence. Few studies have examined violence from the viewpoint of children. The purpose of this study was to examine children's perceptions of the prevalence, incidence, and impact of violence experienced or witnessed by them and to explore the factors that might mitigate and reduce its impact. A national survey of New Zealand children, aged 9 to 13 years, with a representative sample of 2,077 children from 28 randomly selected schools of various sizes, geographic areas and socioeconomic neighbourhoods was undertaken. A questionnaire was developed for children to report the nature and extent of physical, sexual and emotional violence (including bullying) experienced within their main contexts (home and school). To assess the impact of this violence, as well as children's perceptions of school, their coping experiences, and the extent to which they used violence in their own interpersonal relationships, analyses of data comprised frequencies, bivariate correlations, t-tests, and multiple regressions. Results showed high prevalence rates of physical, emotional, and sexual violence. Comparison of the three types of violence revealed emotional violence to be the most prevalent form of violence and as having more impact on children than physical violence. Sexual violence had the most overall impact. Witnessing violence was more prevalent and, except for sexual victimisation, also had greater impact than direct violence. All types of violence involving adults were rated higher than violence involving children. The study also examined the ethical considerations and philosophy underpinning research that involves children. Guided by Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the results support the controversial ethical decision to adopt a passive consent procedure. The study demonstrated children's competence to express the ways in which violence has affected them. Conclusions are that effective development of policy and provision should be based on data that reflects children's perceptions of the violence in the context of their own lives</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children and violence</field><field name="subject">Bullying</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380106 Developmental psychology and ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1469</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology and control of leptospirosis in farmed deer in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Clinical Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ayanegui Alc&#233;rreca, Mar&#237;a Alejandra</field><field name="description">Missing pages 93, 264 &amp; 313 from electronic and Vault (preservation) copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hardjobovis</field><field name="subject">Pomona</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1470</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuous speech recognition : an analysis of its effect on listening comprehension, listening strategies and notetaking : a thesis presented in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctorate in Education, Massey University</field><field name="creator">McIvor, Tom</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation into the effect of Liberated Learning Technology (LLP) on academic listening comprehension, notetaking and listening strategies in an English as a foreign language context (L2). Two studies are reported: an exploratory study and subsequent main study. The exploratory study was undertaken to determine L2 and native speaker (L1) students' perceptions on the effectiveness of the technology on academic listening and notetaking. The main study took a more focused approach and as a result, extended the exploratory study that was done in an authentic lecture context in order to gather data to measure listening comprehension and notetaking quality. The participants in the main study comprised six L2 students: five of whom intended to go to university. The methodology was a multimethod one: data was gathered from notetaking samples, protocol analysis, email responses and a questionnaire. Results indicated that continuous speech recognition (CSR) has the potential to support the listening comprehension and notetaking abilities of L2 students as well as facilitate metacognitive listening strategy use and enhance affective factors in academic listening. However, it is important to note that as CSR is an innovative technology, it first needs to meet a number of challenges before its full potential can be realized. Consequently, recommendations for future research and potential innovative uses for the technology are discussed.

In this thesis we show that mathematical models can accurately describe the distribution of particulate materials that fall to the ground following an eruption. We also report on the development and analysis of mathematical models to calculate the ash concentration in the atmosphere during ashfall after eruptions. Some of these models have analytical solutions. The mathematical models reported on in this thesis not only describe the distribution of ashfall on the ground but are also able to take into account the effect of variation of wind direction with elevation. In order to model the complexity of the atmospheric flow, the atmosphere is divided into horizontal layers. Each layer moves steadily and parallel to the ground: the wind velocity components, particle settling speed and dispersion coefficients are assumed constant within each layer but may differ from layer to layer. This allows for elevation-dependent wind and turbulence profiles, as well as changing particle settling speeds, the last allowing the effects of the agglomeration of particles to be taken into account.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Volcanic ash</field><field name="subject">Volcanic activity</field><field name="subject">Mathematical prediction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230202 Stochastic analysis and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1472</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing labour in the residential aged care sector</field><field name="creator">Kaine, Sarah Jane</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aged Care</field><field name="subject">Labour management</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6300</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sumi tone: a phonological and phonetic description of a Tibeto-Burman language of Nagaland</field><field name="creator">Teo, Amos Benjamin</field><field name="description">Previous research on Sumi, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in the extreme northeast of India, has found it to have three lexical tones. However, the few phonological studies of Sumi have focused mainly on its segmental phonology and have failed to provide any substantial account of the tone system. This thesis addresses the issue by providing the first comprehensive description of tone in this language. In addition to confirming three contrastive tones, this study also presents the first acoustic phonetic analysis of Sumi, looking at the phonetic realisation of these tones and the effects of segmental perturbations on tone realisation. The first autosegmental representation of Sumi tone is offered, allowing us to account for tonal phenomena such as the assignment of surface tones to prefixes that appear to be lexically unspecified for tone. Finally, this investigation presents the first account of morphologically conditioned tone variation in Sumi, finding regular paradigmatic shifts in the tone on verb roots that undergo nominalisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sumi, Naga, Tibeto-Burman, tone</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8535</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of oil exports in the economic development of Iran 1960-1992</field><field name="creator">Haerian Ardakani, Mahmood</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the impact of oil exports on the process of the economic growth in Iran during the period 1960-1992. The study uses single and simultaneous equation regression models to test export-led-growth models in the context of the Iranian economy. The results would seem to suggest that the Iranian economy has been financed with large amounts of oil revenues in the past three decades, especially after the jump in oil prices in 1973. However, the regression analysis suggests that the Iranian economy did not gain as much from these price rises as the other oil producers because of the negative effects of the political turmoil during the last year of the Shah's rule in 1978, the transition of power to the Islamic government and, most of all, because of the heavy damages of the Iraqi-Iranian war.Despite these negative effects the oil sector has played the role of the "leading sector" in the last three decades. The results of the simultaneous equation models suggest that Iranian exports to its major trading partners had a significant impact on the growth of the Iranian economy. The simultaneous regression results also suggest the absence of the feedback effect between the Iranian economy and other economies under study except Brazil, Romania, Singapore and Turkey.The study predicts that the oil sector will continue to play a leading role m future Iranian economic development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1327</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterisation and applications of conducting polymer coated textiles</field><field name="creator">Wu, Jian</field><field name="description">This thesis describes preparation and characterisation of a range of novel conducting polymer coated textiles, which have potential in applications such as static dissipation, EMI shielding, heating elements, composite structures and many military applications. Conducting polypyrrole coated textiles such as nylon Lycra and polyester fabrics have been synthesised using different approaches (Chapter 3). The present study concentrates on preparation of conducting polypyrrole coated textile using an in-situ polymerisation method.  A range of characterisation techniques for the inherently conducting polymer (ICP) coated fabrics were used: the stability of the surface resistivity, cyclic voltammetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that the PPy-coated nylon Lycra fabric could be used as a wearable strain gauge. The strain gauge characteristics have been investigated using both an Instron machine and a &#8220;SmartMotor&#8221;. The use of molecular templates to facilitate the polymerisation and the integration of inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) into textiles has been investigated (Chapter 4). Poly(2-methoxyaniline-5 sulfonic acid) or [PMAS] is a water-soluble, fully sulfonated polyaniline that has been used as molecular template. In the first step &#8211; &#8220;dyeing&#8221; of PMAS into the textile, the effect of fabric pre-treatment, solution pH as well as solution temperature have been investigated. In the second step the effects of the ratio of PMAS to aniline, the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulfate and the polymerisation temperature on the polymerisation reaction have also been studied. Characterisation of the templated polyaniline coated fabric prepared using the above &#8220;Two step&#8221; process has been undertaken (Chapter 4). The stability of the conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis spectra, SEM studies, TGA analysis and strain gauge characteristics have been determined. Results indicate that templated PAn-coated wool nylon Lycra can be used as the strain gauge as tested with either the Instron machine or &#8220;SmartMotor&#8221;.Conducting polymer coated textile fabrics are easily prepared and integrated into truly wearable clothing and garments to create strain sensors with a wide dynamic range. Functional wearable textile sensing systems can monitor human motion, provide immediate bio-feedback to the wearer without changing the properties and functions of the fabric material and with no interference to normal human body motion. This innovative technique can be widely used for injury prevention, rehabilitation, sport technique modification and medical treatment. It will have a number of further potential applications to be used for daily living, work and recreation in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial relations in the Australian engineering industry, 1920-1945: the Amalgamated Engineering Union and craft unionism</field><field name="creator">Inaba, Kouichi</field><field name="description">This thesis examines industrial relations in the Australian engineering industry between 1920 and 1945, with a focus on the legal framework, production methods and union activities. During this period, the Australian engineering industry developed from the 'jobbing' to the manufacturing stage. Therefore, the study assesses the extent to which the traditional industrial order, based on the apprentices-tradesmen system, was affected by this transformation. The investigation focuses on the industrial struggle between capital and labour at the point of production, especially the logic of craft unionism.In the 1920s, the industry remained at the 'jobbing' stage and production was heavily dependent on the craft-type skill of tradesman engineers. Capitalising on this technical advantage, their union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), held strong influence on the shopfloor. The basic industrial strategy of the AEU, as a craft union, was to impose craft regulation on the industry, in order to protect the conventional job territory of tradesmen and restrict the supply of the skilled workforce. Because the main purpose of the Arbitration Court was to maintain industrial peace, its judgements basically confirmed the existing industrial order.  Therefore, the Arbitration system served the Union favourably, legally consolidating craft regulation. Thus, the Union evolved its relationship with the Arbitration system, while strengthening its ties with the Labor Party to secure and supplement the benefits of Arbitration. The Union's basic policy of 'labourism' was thus established in the 1920s in line with its craft orientation.The recovery from the Great Depression and the ensuing development of the industry in the 1930s corresponded to the transformation of the industry towards manufacturing with the introduction of the new "manufacturing' method. In this period, the Court gave priority to improving the condition of the Australian economy, and it encouraged the introduction of the 'manufacturing' method by legally providing cheap labour like 'process workers' and unindentured juniors for simplified operations. However, the actual deskilling effects of the 'manufacturing' method was limited.  Unlike the 'mass production' method which was characterised by the systematic use of automatic, single-purpose machines, the 'manufacturing' method was characterised by the attachment of deskilling devices like jigs, fixtures and stops to standard machines. By this method, Australian employers, who catered almost entirely for a small and fragmented domestic market, secured flexibility in production. However, because the setting up and the operation of standard machines were still largely dependent on tradesman engineers, the employers could not seriously undermine their employees' industrial ground. With the skill of tradesmen maintaining its value, the AEU continued to adapt traditional polices of craft unionism, and these remained effective. Thus, although the validity and efficacy of labourism was tested through the economic turbulence of the decade, the Union's reformist attitude was consolidated. Although the class consciousness of tradesman engineers increased in the Depression, their craft consciousness outweighed it.During the Second World War, the production of the engineering industry was boosted, because of War necessities. Under the circumstances of national crisis, the Union was forced to loosen craft regulation in order to increase the supply of the skilled workforce. Thus, dilutees and even women were introduced into the industry in great numbers. However, the increase in output was realised not so much by the introduction of new production methods as by the intensification of labour and the extensive overtime. The 'manufacturing' method nevertheless remained and so did the dependence on tradesmen's skill. Because the six months' training of dilutees was not sufficient to give them responsible tasks, the technical advantages of legitimate and competent tradesmen, who had served apprenticeship training, survived. In fact, as production increased, the industry was plagued by the dearth of competent tradesmen. Therefore, the AEU maintained its strong industrial position in opposition to the employers, the Court and the Government, and did not let wartime anomalies break the framework of the traditional industrial order. The AEU's practical and reformist attitudes also remained, sharpening the confrontation with more radical, leftist unions of the non-skilled. The empirical investigation in this study corroborates the theoretical assumptions set out in the Introduction. The industrial power of tradesman engineers derived from their technical advantage in production. Capitalising on it, they successfully resisted the employers' efforts to extend their power to manage. The deskilling process by technological development was not a unilinear and straightforward one. The historical process of struggle between organisations of employers and employees was complex, and neither developed a monolithic class loyalty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1435</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Fordism and the politics of industry development in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hampson, Ian</field><field name="description">Post-Fordism suggests the world's economic travails are the birth-pangs of a new, post- Fordist industrial system, with implications for national industrial adjustment. The thesis is a study of post Fordism and the course of the recent industrial policy debate in Australia. It is also a critique of post-Fordism (and its sister doctrine 'flexible specialisation'), as an analysis of events in the world economy, and as a model of industrial development. The thesis focuses on the role and fate of the labour movement, in the recent industrial policy debate, for two reasons. First, the labour movement drove the debate over industry policy in the early 1980s, and second, post- Fordism offers misleading prescriptions for the role the labour movement should play in industrial adjustment.Part one is devoted to exposition and critique of post-Fordism; part two surveys some of the literature on industry development and work organisation, with the question of the roles of the state and the labour movement in mind; part three is devoted to the debates in Australia around industry policy and post-Fordism. The thesis argues that post-Fordism is a flawed account of recent industrial change, and a poor guide to labour movement strategy. It suggests that the union movement's flirtation with enterprise ...i gaining and certain hostile forms of work organisation is, in some measure, due to strategic miscalculations deriving from the influence of post-Fordism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1713</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative manufacturing developments from the semi-periphery: the case of human-centered manufacturing approach in Brazil</field><field name="creator">Guzman, Gustavo Abel</field><field name="description">The key research question of this study is to determine if Brazihan firms are applying the human-centred manufacturing approaches and if so, to explore how and to what extent this is happening. From this, two related research topics emerge: (i) how macro contextual conditions support or constrain the implementation of the HC model; and (ii) which are the main technical and organisational features of a 'tropicalized' (adapted) HC model in Brazilian firms. In order to address these questions, case studies were carried out in 10 Brazilian firms. The aim of the empirical study was to determine the form and level of human-centredness in these firms and to explore the factors affecting this. An examination was then made of the patterns of human-centred development and its links with product, process and environmental factors, identified in the literature as key influences on HC systems developments. Two theoretical approaches were used to inform the empirical component of this study in order to explain the application of New Production Systems and, specifically the Human-centred approach in the semi-periphery. Firstly, the examination at the level of the firm, integrates constructivist views of people, technology and organisation with the concept of manufacturing engineering systems as well as the organisation configuration approach. This helps to understand "how" the human-centred approach was applied in Brazil. Secondly, a political economy examination of the macro contextual factors assisted to understand "why" related questions. Key findings of this study refer to the wide range of adaptation to local conditions of new production systems. This is explained by contextual institutional factors, such as industrial relations and regional labour markets. In contrast to established human-centred theory, the degree of human-centredness in the organisational arena was not strongly linked to either (i) human-centred designed technology; (ii) to new product market variety and change; or (iii)characteristics of the firm.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1707</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of management control in a family managed business in an emerging economy: the case of Dilmah tea in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Herath, Siriyama Kanthi</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the patterns of management control existing in a family controlled tea exporting company in Sri Lanka, Ceylon Tea Services Ltd (Dilmah).

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dr. Samuel Arnold (1740-1802), an historical assessment</field><field name="creator">Hoskins, Robert H. B.</field><field name="description">Samuel Arnold (1740-1802) was a dominating figure of his time whose works. enjoyed critical acclaim and popular success. In the twentieth century he has remained known as the editor of Handel&#8217;s works but his reputation as a composer, strong in his own time, has suffered a critical eclipse. The intention of the present thesis is to provide the first specialized study of Samuel Arnold. In so doing the author aims to examine his accomplishments as a prominent musician, to re-establish his critical reputation as a composer, and at the same time to offer a thematic bibliographic catalogue of his works. The first volume gives a detailed account of Arnold's life and works. Though biographical articles on the composer have appeared in Grove&#8217;s Dictionary and the New Grove, Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, Dictionary of National Biography, and in A Biographical Dictionary of Actors and ... Musicians (ed. Philip H. Highfill), much has been left unsaid. The author has synthesized information in secondary sources and verified these sources whenever possible by reference to the documents treated; in addition he has, by personal consultation of contemporary documents in English archives, discovered a mass of material hitherto unrecorded. Chapter one, therefore, summarizes all the known facts about the composer and his activities as a leading figure in London&#8217;s musical life, while chapter two is devoted to a complete survey of Arnold's non-dramatic works, ranging from nine oratorios, through instrumental music to settings of English poetry and other intimate or occasional pieces. The selective approach in discussing Arnold&#8217;s non-dramatic works has not been followed, however, for chapters three to six, which deal with his stage music. Arnold&#8217;s sixty-nine operas, seven pantomimes, three ballets, and seven scores of incidental music are so significant, both musically and historically, that the author has considered it essential to deal with each one individually. Besides presenting new material on the genesis and reception of each work, the author analyses all the surviving music. Chapter three, therefore, is devoted to Arnold&#8217;s all-sung operas, chapter four to the full-length operas with spoken dialogue, chapter five to the afterpiece operas with spoken dialogue, and chapter six to the pantomimes, ballets and incidental music; more than one hundred music examples illustrate the study. To complete volume one there is an extensive bibliography, as well as a transcription of Arnold&#8217;s unpublished additional music to John Gay's Polly (1777). The second volume is devoted to the compilation of a thematic catalogue of Arnold&#8217;s complete works. The aim of this catalogue is to provide a guide to the identification of his compositions and to add a comprehensive descriptive bibliography both of his manuscripts and of the early editions of his printed works. The catalogue is, therefore, meant to tell what Arnold wrote, when and (often) why he wrote and published a certain work, who printed and sold it, and where copies are to be found. In collating the works, information on their internal make-up has been given in each case, and, in addition, a full description of the title-page of each of the first editions is set out. For the bibliographical detail it has been necessary to examine contemporary newspaper advertisements, all the appropriate publishers&#8217; catalogues, the muniment books at stationers Hall and, where possible, a copy or several copies of every item listed. The holdings of the appropriate public and private libraries were consulted and a large number of changes and additions made to the information collected in such works of reference as the British Union-Catalogue of Early Music and the volume of Repertoire International des Sources Musicales devoted to the eighteenth century. The present bibliographical and musicological account sheds new light on samuel Arnold&#8217;s life and works, and, equally important, on the world in which he lived. It is concluded that not only was he a cultivated man, prominent in the musical life of his time, but also a skilful composer, whose diverse productions have their own merits.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3411</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of hatha yoga on birth outcomes of first-time mothers in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moore, Sharon Dee</field><field name="description">Yoga is an ancient health practice that provides integrated control and harmonious balance through a practice of postures, muscle contractions, controlled breathing, and meditation. Although yoga has been popularized in New Zealand as a complementary, nontraditional physical fitness regime for pregnant women, little is known empirically about the safety and effectiveness of yoga during pregnancy. The primary aim of this natural history study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of antenatal yoga for first-time mothers in New Zealand. This study investigated how first-time mothers who participated in yoga (N=34) performed across a range of antenatal and postnatal measures, taken during their third trimester of pregnancy (Time 1: T1) and at three months postpartum (Time 2; T2), when compared with first-time mothers who did not participate in yoga (N=37). An additional aim of the study was to attempt to predict birth type from the above measures. Measures assessed demographic factors (T1), antenatal pain medication preferences (T1) and utilisation of pain relief during labour (T2), physical activity levels (T1, T2), complementary therapy utilisation (T1), maternal mood (T1, T2), social networks (T1, T2), maternal self-efficacy (T2), and labour experience and birth outcomes (T2). Those in the yoga group reported greater satisfaction with their diet, used a greater number of complementary therapies, had a preference for significantly less analgesia during labour, and were less likely to be prescribed bedrest or require an episiotomy compared to those in the nonyoga group. The two groups did not differ significantly on other antenatal or postnatal measures. Among a number of significant correlates of birth outcomes for the group as a whole, natural birth was associated with having a midwife or GP as lead maternity carer, shorter labour durations, less utilisation of analgesia, and more tearing. Heavier birth weights were associated with greater use of complimentary therapies, dietary supplements, longer labours and greater maternal depression and overall mood disturbance three months postpartum when compared with women who had children with lower birth weight. Higher 1-minute Apgar scores were associated with higher consumption of dietary supplements during pregnancy, while higher 5- Hatha Yoga and Birth Outcomes in New Zealand ii minute Apgar scores were associated with lower anger / hostility and working antenatally. Maternal factors which significantly predicted vaginal versus cesarean delivery and medical versus natural delivery were, participation in antenatal yoga, levels of complementary therapy utilisation, self-rating of diet, maternal age, and level of analgesia utilised during labour. When these variables were considered individually, level of analgesia utilised during labour, self-reported diet and maternal age significantly predicted natural versus medical delivery. However, of the aforementioned maternal variables, only level of analgesia utilised during labour significantly predict medical (i.e., casearean and operative births) versus natural birth. This study of antenatal yoga among first-time mothers in the Auckland region of New Zealand found the practice of antenatal yoga to be safe and associated with a number of benefits. However, before the practice of antenatal yoga can be recommended, a larger randomized control study is warranted. Future research in this field should also investigate the influence and practice of antenatal yoga among women from socially and ethnically diverse populations, including those residing outside of main urban centres.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5797</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality effect in the design of adaptive e-learning systems : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information System at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Al-Dujaily, Amal</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis is a theoretical and practical study concerning the user model for adaptive e-learning systems. The research activity is two-fold. It firstly explores the personality aspect in the user model which has been overlooked in the previous literature on the design of adaptive e-learning systems, in order to see whether learners with different types of personality would have different effects on their learning performance with adaptive e-learning systems. And secondly, it investigates how to embody the personality features in the current user model, proposing that the inclusion of the personality in the user model for adaptive e-learning systems would lead to better learning performance. The thesis has considered the personality aspect in four parts. PART I reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on adaptive e-learning systems from which the main research questions are constructed. It explains how this study derives an overarching model for the inclusion of personality type in effective e-learning systems. PART II consists of the experiments, which explore empirically the importance of identifying the personality in the user model for adaptive e-learning and its effect in individual learning. That is, the main theme of the thesis hypothesises that different personality type&#8217;s influence performance with e-learning systems. PART III shows the effects of personality type on groups of learners performing collaborative learning activities. It suggests practical implications of designing collaborative learning technologies in conjunction with the personality feature. Finally, PART IV includes personality in the proposed user model and tests the primary hypothesis that &#8220;the personality may influence the learning performance of students using adaptive e-learning systems&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">instructional systems</field><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/668</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualified difference sets : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Byard, Kevin</field><field name="description">Qualified difference sets are a class of combinatorial configuration. The sets are related to the residue difference sets that were first discussed in detail in 1953 by Emma Lehmer. Qualified difference sets consist of a set of residues modulo an integer v and they possess attractive properties that suggest potential applications in areas such as image formation, signal processing and aperture synthesis. This thesis outlines the theory behind qualified difference sets and gives conditions for the existence and nonexistence of these sets in various cases. A special case of the qualified difference sets is the qualified residue difference sets. These consist of the set of nth power residues of certain types of prime. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of qualified residue difference sets are derived and the precise conditions for the existence of these sets are given for n = 2, 4 and 6. Qualified residue difference sets are proved nonexistent for n = 8, 10, 12, 14 and 18. A generalisation of the qualified residue difference sets is introduced. These are the qualified difference sets composed of unions of cyclotomic classes. A cyclotomic class is defined for an integer power n and the results of an exhaustive computer search are presented for n = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Two new families of qualified difference set were discovered in the case n = 8 and some isolated systems were discovered for n = 6, 10 and 12.

Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Schoolbag carriage : design, adjustment, carriage duration and weight : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ergonomics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mackie, Hamish William</field><field name="description">There is anecdotal and scientific evidence to suggest that schoolbag carriage is associated with musculoskeletal discomfort (MSD) and possibly long-term back pain. Thus schoolbag carriage is an area of concern for students, parents and both education and health professionals. A schoolbag weight limit of 10% of body weight (BW) is currently recommended. However, it is based on subjective observations rather than objective findings and does not consider other aspects of schoolbag carriage such as schoolbag design and adjustment or carriage patterns. Five studies were conducted in order to determine the effects on students' responses to schoolbag carriage of schoolbag design, adjustment, carriage duration and weight. Backpack design had a significant effect on reported musculoskeletal discomfort and choice of backpack. Schoolbag hip-belt and shoulder strap adjustment and weight significantly affected shoulder strap tension forces and shoulder interface pressure in simulated schoolbag carriage. Using activity monitoring, school students were found to spend approximately two hours carrying their schoolbags each day. This usually comprised 11-15 times per day of 8-9 minutes of carriage. Using this temporal pattern information, 16 boys (13-14 years) were exposed to a simulated school day using schoolbags weighing 0, 5, 10, 12.5 and 15% BW and an additional condition of 10% BW with tighter shoulder straps. Posture, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), muscular strain and reported ability to walk and balance were significantly affected when schoolbag load reached 10% BW. However, despite these findings, the magnitude of self reported muscular strain and MSD suggested that 15% BW may be too heavy for school students. Thus, 10% BW may be an appropriate upper schoolbag weight limit for a typical school day. Using a psychophysical approach the mean (standard deviation) maximum acceptable schoolbag weight (MASW) selected by 16 school boys (13-14 years) was 10.4(3.8) %BW. This finding agrees with the findings of the previous study and supports the current schoolbag weight recommendation of 10% BW. The results of the five studies can be used in developing schoolbag carrying guidelines to help reduce the prevalence of MSD amongst school students.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School bags</field><field name="subject">Schoolbags</field><field name="subject">Ergonomics</field><field name="subject">Human engineering</field><field name="subject">High school students</field><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="subject">Lifting and carrying</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321201 Environmental and occupational health and safety</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1478</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic assessment and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of herbage and seed production traits in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.

Major traits identified for herbage production were leaf elongation rate (LER), leaf lamina length (LL), tiller number (TN) and tiller weight (TW), and for increased seed production were seed yield per head (SdYH), reproductive tiller number (RT), reproductive tillers with matured heads (TMH), florets per head (FH), spikelets per head (SH), florets per spikelet (FS), floret site utilization (FSU) and seed weight (TSW). A genetic linkage map spanning 582 centimorgans (cM) was constructed with EST-SSR (simple sequence repeat markers derived from expressed sequence tags) and used to identify QTL for herbage dry weight (DW) and seed yield per plant (SdYP), and their key component traits. Significant genotype by environment effects were encountered for herbage yield, with fewer QTL identified in spring than in autumn. For some traits, ranking of genotypes differed greatly between seasons and different QTL were identified. QTL for DW were identified on linkage groups (Lg) 1 and 6. The QTL on Lg 6 co-located with QTL for TN, while that on Lg 1 co-located with LER and LL. Markers at Lg 1 QTL (qDW-03-1.1) may be more useful for increasing herbage production by MAS because selection for high LER and long LL has been suggested to increase herbage production in perennial ryegrass. QTL for SdYP were identified on Lg 2 and Lg 6. The QTL on Lg 6 co-located with QTL for SdYH, FSU and TSW, while that on Lg 2 co-located with FH, SH and FS. For seed production, markers at Lg 6 QTL (qSdYP-03-6) may be very useful because this QTL co-located with QTL for SdYH, FSU and TSW, and SdYH has been identified previously as a key selection criterion for increasing seed yield. Marker-trait validation confirmed markers pps0495 and pps0698 identified by QTL analysis to be potentially useful for selecting for fast leaf appearance and long LL, respectively, in perennial ryegrass.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perennial ryegrass analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270207 Quantitative genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1474</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparing teachers as professional educators : a new conception for pre-service teacher education : a thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vossler, Kathleen Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a new conception for pre-service teacher education. Current pre-service teacher education programmes are, in the main, one-dimensional, skill-based and performative: one-dimensional, in that programmes focus on preparing teachers to deliver a pre-determined curriculum; skill-based, in that professional judgement and reasoning are ignored; and, performative in the prescribed nature of knowledge and the drive to establish standards and competencies. Rather than focusing on professionalism - which is at the heart of what it means to be an educator - professionalisation, economic-driven policies and political ideologies underpin contemporary pre-service teacher education programmes. The new conception for pre-service teacher education has at its core, teachers as professional educators. This thesis argues that in order for teachers to become professional educators, their preparation ought to be enhanced and broadened to incorporate aspects of professional judgement, professional expertise, and ethical and moral commitment. To enable this to occur, pre-service teachers need to learn what it means to be moral agents through active and authentic engagement within communities of practice and learners. In sum, the professional educator's role is argued to be an agent for, and of, change who promotes and engenders an education system that underpins a socially, culturally and economically just society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher training</field><field name="subject">Professionalism</field><field name="subject">Teacher ethics</field><field name="subject">Teacher morals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1475</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probation practice, leadership and effective service delivery : a qualitative study of the perspectives of probation officers and service managers in the New Zealand Probation Service : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dale, Michael Philip</field><field name="description">The primary goal of this thesis is to consider probation practice and the contribution of leadership to the achievement of effective service delivery in the New Zealand Community Probation Service during a period of major change. In relation to this goal, the objectives are: (a) to explore Probation Officers' and Service Managers' understandings of the political and managerial changes affecting the New Zealand Probation Service; (b) to ascertain Probation Officers' and Service Managers' views of probation values, knowledge, skills and practice; (c) to understand Probation Officers' and Service Managers' views of the assessment of service delivery; (d) to identify how Probation Officers and Service Managers define and what they understand by the concepts of leadership and effective service delivery; (e) to examine how the relationship between leadership and effective service delivery is perceived and acted upon by Probation Officers and Service Managers; and (f) to determine the structures and processes that are necessary to maximise the contribution of leadership to the achievement of effective service delivery. The research participants comprised a purposeful sample of 27 Probation Officers and 8 Service Managers (front-line staff involved in service delivery) recruited from among those employed in the northern and southern administrative regions of the Probation Service. Qualitative data were collected via personal in-depth interviews and augmented by focus group discussions. The key findings of the study are that: first, effective service delivery was not perceived to be limited to the reduction of recidivism alone, but to also include the client's broader social experience, recognising that positive social benefit can extend beyond the simple measurement of offending behaviour. second, leaders must be seen to be credible if they are to create willing followers. This credibility rested upon the leader's possession of relevant practice knowledge and skills, their demonstrated commitment to professional practice, their ability to provide clear direction for practice and their ability to ensure that adequate resources are available to achieve service delivery goals; third, a positive association was drawn between a leader's professional experience, possession of personal power and ability to influence Probation Officer practice. In essence, the leader's experience and competence has a bearing upon confidence in the leader. Participants also posited a connection between positive leadership, the development of a 'team' culture, Probation Officer work performance and service delivery. Overall, the linkage between leadership and effective service delivery was conceived of as being dependent upon the ability of leaders to enhance the practice of Probation Officers. From this perspective, five leadership challenges for senior managers in the Probation Service were identified. These included the challenges to: (a) establish the professional foundations of probation practice; (b) develop a clearer, integrated statement of purpose, values and beliefs that identifies probation as a distinct area of professional practice; (c) develop probation practice in a flexible manner, incorporating international influences while remaining responsive to features and events that reflect the dynamic character of the local environment; (d) to ensure that the integrative structures, processes and new roles/positions necessary to underpin and support probation practice are introduced or implemented, notably for the provision of professional supervision; and (e) to introduce a multi-dimensional approach to the assessment of service delivery that includes both quantitative and qualitative indicators of aspects other than recidivism alone. It is acknowledged that these challenges have significant resource implications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Probation Service</field><field name="subject">Service delivery</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1476</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">q-series in number theory and combinatorics : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lam, Heung Yeung</field><field name="description">Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was one of the world's greatest mathematical geniuses.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate Ramanujan's 1&#968;1summation formula and explore its applications to number theory and combinatorics. First, we consider several classical important results on elliptic functions and then give new proofs of these results using Ramanujan's 1&#968;1 summation formula. For example, we will present a number of classical and new solutions for the problem of representing an integer as sums of squares (one of the most celebrated in number theory and combinatorics) in this thesis. This will be done by using q-series and Ramanujan's 1&#968;1 summation formula. This in turn will give an insight into how Ramanujan may have proven many of his results, since his own proofs are often unknown, thereby increasing and deepening our understanding of Ramanujan's work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Srinivasa Ramanujan</field><field name="subject">Summation formula</field><field name="subject">Elliptic functions</field><field name="subject">Mathematical transformations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230102 Number theory and field theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1477</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of oil exports in the economic development of Iran 1960-1992</field><field name="creator">Haerian Ardakani, Mahmood</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the impact of oil exports on the process of the economic growth in Iran during the period 1960-1992. The study uses single and simultaneous equation regression models to test export-led-growth models in the context of the Iranian economy. The results would seem to suggest that the Iranian economy has been financed with large amounts of oil revenues in the past three decades, especially after the jump in oil prices in 1973. However, the regression analysis suggests that the Iranian economy did not gain as much from these price rises as the other oil producers because of the negative effects of the political turmoil during the last year of the Shah's rule in 1978, the transition of power to the Islamic government and, most of all, because of the heavy damages of the Iraqi-Iranian war.Despite these negative effects the oil sector has played the role of the "leading sector" in the last three decades. The results of the simultaneous equation models suggest that Iranian exports to its major trading partners had a significant impact on the growth of the Iranian economy. The simultaneous regression results also suggest the absence of the feedback effect between the Iranian economy and other economies under study except Brazil, Romania, Singapore and Turkey.The study predicts that the oil sector will continue to play a leading role m future Iranian economic development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1327</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biography of Crawford Munro: A vision for Australia's water and a survey of twentieth century Australian science biography</field><field name="creator">Leonard Humphreys</field><field name="description">1. The biography of Crawford Munro (1904-76) describes his early life in Toowoomba and Sydney, and his maturation as an engineer, working for Sydney Water, Sydney Technical College and in the production of Cruiser tanks in World War II. He was a large confident man with a big voice and an optimistic, humorous personality. As the Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales Munro was liberal, fostered humanist studies and developed the School of Engineering with a unique emphasis on water engineering. He recruited excellent staff for research and postgraduate education who led the nation across all phases of hydrology and hydraulics. Munro developed a remarkable, rational solution for flood mitigation at Launceston, and actively promoted research, partly through the Australian Water Research Foundation and the Institution of Engineers, Australia. He was much involved with predicting flood runoff, developing benefit/cost relations for irrigation schemes, which led him into public controversy, and other hydrological projects. Munro&#8217;s attempts to raise social consciousness about water problems, his multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of water resources and his campaigns for the collection of stream and rainfall data helped provide a better basis for proper planning. In his later years he undertook the first Australian environmental impact study. The concluding chapter outlines a vision for the current management of Australia&#8217;s water. Munro posed necessary questions about measuring the supply of water and bringing the demand of water into synchrony with its supply, while providing water security in terms of its availability and quality. He raised the debate about the balance between sustaining environmental flows, utilizing water for agriculture and secondary industry, and maintaining the health of communities. Munro hoped equitable decision making would emerge from public engagement on these issues. 2. Twentieth century science biography in Australia is the province of a group of elite male scientists, whose interests cover wide disciplinary fields; it is focused on popular imagination: health, food and adventure (Antarctica) accounting for fifteen of the seventeen scientists. Empathy for the subject is a significant feature of the nineteen biographers, of whom five are scientists. This small genre is often supported by institutions in small print runs. A key role of biography is to place through science history a more epistemologically plausible version of events. Public discourses of science treated in the essay include conflict about the attribution of scientific discovery, the vocation of the scientist as a contributor to a wider social polity, the light biography sheds on sources of creativity and the evolution of the research and culture of institutions. The biographer attempts to generate a personal portrait of the scientist which conveys authority about the significance and origins of his or her scientific discoveries and their impact in the wider social context. Daniel S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s affirmation of the existential approach which &#8216;emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the human individual&#8217; resonates with the candidate as expressing characteristics of the lives of many Australian scientists in their passion for intellectual discovery, their motivation to self-empowerment, and their readiness top step outside their social conditioning. This essay extends S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s paradigm to the context of Australian science biography and indicates some constraints on its depiction which arise in the practice of writing science biography. Some epistemological issues are raised in the texts, especially when dealing with oral history and family mythology, and thematic, thematic within a chronological framework or chronological structures of the text are compared. The level of detail and context influence the sustainability of the reader&#8217;s interest. Case studies of the biographies written by the candidate (Ian Clunies Ross, Samuel Wadham, Allan Callaghan, Victor Trikojus, Raymond Hoffenberg and Crawford Munro) illustrate issues which arise in the writing of science biography. The dominant question is the relationship of the biographer to the subject, and this determines the voice the reader hears. The motivation of the biographer may arise in varying degrees of empathy felt for the subject. The high affinity the candidate had for Clunies Ross and Hoffenberg causes him to offer a defence against the charge of hagiography, and the selectivity and subjectivity of the biographer is evident in the arrangement and presentation of factual material. The motivation of the biographer is additionally directed to the communication of the subject&#8217;s research outputs to the wider Australian community, and in the case of Callaghan, Wadham and Clunies Ross there was a specific programmatic function of advancing the status of agricultural science. It is argued that the description of the public life of the subject needs to be complemented from the private life if the biographer is &#8216;to view the world through the eyes of the subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">science biography, epistemology, history, science institutions, munro, water, hydrology, environmental sustainability, irrigation, planning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193508</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Islamic Conceptualisations of Press Freedom in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Nerawi Sedu</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the conceptions of press freedom from the Islamic perspective. It examined how certain segments of Malaysian society, including government officers, religious leaders, members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of political parties, perceive press freedom in their country. Compared to previous studies on media freedom or press freedom in Malaysia, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of variables significantly related to the conceptualisation and practice of press freedom, which include economic development, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and globalisation. One significant difference between this study and previous studies was the specific examination of Islamic conceptions of press freedom, which represents a major contribution to existing knowledge. As Malaysia is a complex multi-racial and multi-religious nation, factors such as national ideologies and cultural values were addressed when examining conceptions of press freedom. Due to the focus of the study, two types of framework were utilised: an Islamic theoretical framework and media theories developed by Western scholars. Methodologically, this study employed an ethnographic approach for analysing Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom. A combination of three qualitative research techniques - in-depth face-to-face interviews, examination of archival documents, and personal observations - was utilised to investigate the issues identified in relation to perceptions of press freedom in Malaysia. In-depth face-to-face interviews involved the participation of staff and members from ten organisations and individuals who were not affiliated with these organisations. The organisations involved in this study were: Ministry of Internal Security Malaysia (MOIS); Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (IKIM); Islamic Da&#8217;wah Foundation Malaysia (YADIM); Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM); Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM); Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ); Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM); Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS), People&#8217;s Justice Party (PKR); and Puteri UMNO. The archival documents analysed in this study were gathered from these ten organisations. However, due to certain organisational policies and security concerns, personal observations were only conducted at eight organisations, IKIM, YADIM, ABIM, JIM, CIJ, SUARAM, PAS and PKR. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the data analysis were triangulated to ascertain the extent to which the information obtained was consistent or inconsistent across sources. The findings of the study showed that there were diverse views among respondents on what constitutes an Islamic press freedom in a multi-racial and multi-religious Malaysia. Due to the different levels of Islamic understanding and divergent interpretations of Islam among Muslims, especially among members of political parties, this study also found that the Islamic theory of press freedom is a highly contested concept. More often than not, the respondents of these organisations claimed that Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom should be based on their personal versions of Islam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom, Islamic perspective, tawhid, conservatism, liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194709</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Song function in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae): the use of song in the social interactions of singers on migration</field><field name="creator">Joshua Smith</field><field name="description">Male song and other acoustic signals are often sexually selected traits that are common in many taxa, such as birds, anurans and insects. Song often serves a dual function in female attraction and male-male competition and song characteristics such as duration, rate, repertoire size and amplitude are important for both functions and to be correlated with male reproductive success. Male humpback whales are well known for singing a complex and highly stereotyped song during the breeding season and while the song appears important in the social interactions of humpback whales during the breeding season, the function of song is still unclear. Current debate surrounds whether song is primarily directed towards females as an elaborate acoustic display or towards other males to facilitate male social ordering. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the nature of interactions between singers and conspecifics and document the context in which singing occurs. This was achieved by: (1) investigating the movement patterns and interactions between singing and non-singing whales and (2) examining differences in the song structure and source levels of song within a social context. To investigate song function, simultaneous observations of the positions and movements of singing and non-singing whales were obtained in real time during their southward migration off the east coast of Australia in September and October of 2002 - 2004. Data on the interactions of whales were collected by acoustic tracking using a hydrophone array, visual tracking using land-based hilltop observations and observations collected from a small boat. Of a total 114 singers, 48 did not associate with other whales whereas 66 were involved in 63 associations. Singers were significantly more likely to join groups containing a female and calf than any other group type and the only groups with which singers started to sing after joining were unescorted mother-calf pairs. Singers also associated for longer and sang for a significantly greater proportion of time in the presence of a female-calf pair than any other group type. Previous studies demonstrate that associating with females with a calf can be a reproductively successful strategy for males. In contrast, whales that joined singers were usually lone males, these associations were brief and singers typically stopped singing in the presence of other males. These findings provide the highest reported incidence in humpback whales of males singing when escorting females and support an intersexual function of song in humpback whales. A suggested explanation for observations of males joining singers is that these males are prospecting for females rather than engaging in male social ordering and that singing may incur the cost of attracting competing males. To investigate the importance of surface active behaviours in interactions involving singers and whether singers utilize the acoustic cues from these behaviours to locate other groups, the frequency and type of surface active behaviours were quantified in singing and non-singing groups. Compared to singers that were alone and did not interact with other whales, surrounding groups were significantly closer to a singer (on average 2.8 km distance) when singers joined other groups, and singers joined other groups that were surface active in 54 % of cases. While source levels of different surface active behaviours vary and certain behaviours might be better suited for inter-group communication, it is unlikely that singers rely primarily on acoustic cues from surface active behaviours to locate other groups. Surface activity was not more common in groups just prior to singers joining them, and while not significantly so, surface activity increased when singers affiliated with other groups suggesting an importance in intra-group dynamics. Whereas lone singers were the least surface active, groups containing a calf were found to exhibit a significantly higher rate of surface activity than groups without a calf, for which the calf displayed the majority of behaviours. Considering singers predominantly joined mother-calf pairs, it could be speculated that a high rate of surface activity by a calf might inadvertently attract singers and other surrounding males to these groups and could increase the probability of singers and other males locating mother-calf groups. To further explore a context of singing, the structure and amplitude of songs were investigated over two years for singers in two distinct social contexts; lone singers and singing escorts. A total of 274 songs from 27 singers in 2003 and 2004 were analysed, with a subset of data used for source level comparisons. Lone singers consistently sang longer songs compared to singing escorts due to a greater repetition of phrases most noticeably within one theme (theme C), the theme in which all singers sang the most common song unit (the moan) at higher amplitude compared to the other three themes in which it occurred. These findings suggest that lone singers might increase the repetition of phrases sung at higher amplitude to maximise the broadcast of their song and maximise their probability of detection. In contrast, singing escorts sang shorter songs due to a reduced repetition of phrases in most themes, particularly the theme containing the loudest song units (theme C). Consequently, singing escorts sang the song more quickly, resulting in a higher song rate compared to lone singers. Comparisons of the average broadband source levels of nine song units in the 2004 song showed significant variation among the nine different units and among the 22 individual singers for each song unit. Source levels of one of the nine song units also varied significantly between lone singers and singing escorts. Singing escorts produced higher source levels than lone singers for the &#8216;cry&#8217; which showed a difference of 4 dB higher than lone singers. Lone singers typically produced higher source levels for the &#8216;moans&#8217;, which were low frequency sounds that propagate well, although this was not significant. We suggest that amplitude of the song might be important in female assessment of singers and the particular song units that singing escorts sing more loudly are the basis for this assessment. These findings further support an inter-sexual function of song in humpback whales. This study has described in detail the contexts in which males are observed to sing and has been able to provide new interpretations on the social interactions of singers. The results within this thesis provide the highest reported occurrence in humpback whales of males singing in the presence of females and strongly suggest that song has an inter-sexual function. Further work is needed that investigates song structure within a social context and the potential for song functioning as a long distance advertisement display and/ or courtship display.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual selection</field><field name="subject">Song</field><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Acoustic display</field><field name="subject">Humpback whale</field><field name="subject">Megaptera novaeangliae</field><field name="subject">Source level</field><field name="subject">Social interaction</field><field name="subject">Migration - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205170</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular basis for sulfite oxidation in a bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase from Starkeya novella</field><field name="creator">Trevor Rapson</field><field name="description">Sulfite oxidising enzymes are found in all forms of life and play an important role in detoxification of sulfite produced through biochemical processes. All known sulfite oxidising enzymes share a common molybdenum active site. The sulfite dehydrogenase (SDH) from the soil bacterium Starkeya novella differs from the vertebrate sulfite oxidases (SO) in that the heme and Mo subunits are tightly associated rather than connected by a flexible hinge. This structural integrity makes SDH an ideal model enzyme for the study of enzymatic sulfite oxidation without the complications of structural changes underlying catalysis. In human sulfite oxidase (HSO) the substitution of a conserved active site amino acid residue, Arg-160 for Gln, results in a lethal disease. A number of independent studies have been carried out in order to understand the effects of this substitution on catalysis in both human (HSO) and chicken sulfite oxidising enzymes (CSO). The focus of this work is the analogous residue in SDH, Arg 55. A number of active site substitutions have been investigated, including SDHR55Q, an analogous substitution to the lethal mutation identified in humans. In addition, the properties of the Arg residue have also been probed using a substitution to a hydrophobic residue, Met (SDHR55M) and a substitution to the positively charged Lys (SDHR55K). A fourth active site substitution, SDHH57A, was also investigated as the crystal structure of this variant indicated that His-57 plays a role in stabilising the position of Arg-55 in SDH. It was of interest to determine the effect of the instability in the position of Arg-55 on the catalytic parameters of the SDHH57A. The kinetic properties of the substituted enzymes were investigated using steady-state assays with cytochrome c as an electron acceptor. When the positive charge was lost in the case of SDHR55M and SDHR55Q, a dramatic increase in the KM (sulfite - app) of 2 &#8211; 3 orders of magnitude resulted. This indicates that the positive charge on Arg-55 is important for substrate binding. All the Arg-55 variants studied were found to have lower turnover numbers than the wild type, in particular, SDHR55Q was found to have a reduced kcat (108 s-1 vs 345 s-1 for SDHWT at pH 8). The changes in the Mo centre underlying the altered kinetic properties were investigated in detail using EPR spectroscopy of the intermediate MoV oxidation state in SDHR55Q and SDHH57A. Similar to what has been noted for HSOR160Q, a sulfate blocked form was observed at pH 6 using pulsed EPR experiments, suggesting that this substitution causes an inhibition of the hydrolysis step required to release the reaction product, sulfate. This could be a further reason for the poor catalytic activity of SDHR55Q, in particular, a reason for the low turnover rate of this variant. Unlike what was noted in HSOR160Q, where the substituted enzyme showed a dramatic decrease in rate of intramolecular transfer by three orders of magnitude compared to HSOWT, the rate of electron transfer was found to be 3 times faster in SDHR55Q relative to the wild type enzyme. These results indicate that Arg-55 is not involved in the pathway of electron transfer between the Mo and heme centres, but rather assists with the the docking of the heme group in HSO. As this process is not required in SDH, our results suggest that intramolecular electron transfer (IET) in HSOR160Q decreases because it is crucial for docking of the heme domain. Through potentiometric redox titrations, the effect of the active site amino acid substitutions on both the Mo and Fe redox potentials was investigated. No significant change was determined for the MoVI/V redox potentials, however, the heme potentials for SDHWT and SDHR55K were 40 mV higher than those of the other variants, with the lowest potentials belonging to SDHR55M and SDHH57A. Of further interest was that the MoVI/V couple is significantly lower than the heme couple (175 mV vs 240 mV respectively) in SDHWT. It appears that the positive charge of the Arg is important in regulating the heme redox potentials and could thereby contribute to modulating enzymatic activity. When SDH was immobilised on a modified pyrolytic graphite electrode, stable and high catalytic currents were observed, indicating facile heterogeneous electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode. This good electron transfer allowed the catalytic properties of SDH and its substituted enzymes to be investigated as a function of potential. A pH dependence ( 59 mV/pH) in the catalytic operating potential was noted for SDHWT and SDHR55K, which appears to follow the pH dependence of the MoVI/V couple. This catalytic potential is pH-independent in the R55M and H57A variants, where the catalytic operating potentials appeared to follow the FeIII/II redox couple. It is proposed that two distinct pathways of electron transfer from the Mo centre to the electrode are likely to exist. The first is direct transfer from the Mo centre to the electrode at lower potential (~ 175 mV) while the second proceeds via the heme group (320 mV). The pathway followed is determined by the oxidation state of the heme group. A slight difference in the electron transfer rates of these two processes was seen, with direct transfer (from Mo) being the faster, which accounts for the unusual peak shape noted in the voltammogram for SDHWT at high sulfite concentrations, where the rate of catalytic activity slows at a higher potentials despite the greater thermodynamic driving force. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of enzymatic sulfite oxidation. Arg-55 has been shown to play an important role in the catalytic functioning of SDH in both substrate affinity and product release. Unlike what has been previously proposed, Arg-55 does not play a part in the pathway of electron transfer, but is rather involved in the regulation of the redox potentials of the metal centres in the enzyme.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molybdenum Enzyme</field><field name="subject">electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">electron paramagnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">laser flash photolysis</field><field name="subject">enzyme kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205585</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of Broome virus, a new fusogenic orthoreovirus species.</field><field name="creator">Claudia Thalmann</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the molecular characterisation of Broome virus (BroV), a new fusogenic orthoreovirus species that was isolated from a little red flying-fox (Pteropus scapulatus) in Broome, Western Australia in 2002. The BroV genome consists of ten segments of dsRNA, each containing a plus-strand with a 3&#8217; terminal pentanucleotide sequence that is conserved amongst all viruses in the genus Orthoreovirus, family Reoviridae, and a 5&#8217; terminal pentanucleotide sequence that is unique to BroV. With the exception of S4, all genome segments are predicted to encode a single translation product producing a total of seven structural and four nonstructural proteins. All BroV proteins were identified as homologues of known orthoreovirus proteins and shown to have similar secondary structure and possess key conserved amino acid sequence motifs and structural features implicated in biological function. Notably, no cell-attachment protein gene homologue was identified in the BroV genome suggesting the use of an alternate cell entry mechanism to that employed by most orthoreoviruses. The amino acid sequence identity between cognate BroV proteins and those of other orthoreoviruses ranges from 13-50%, which is too low for BroV to be considered a new isolate of any established orthoreovirus species group. Phylogenetic analyses based on both structural and nonstructural proteins provide additional evidence to support this claim. It is proposed that BroV is the prototype member of a new sixth species group Broome virus, in the genus Orthoreovirus. The complete genome characterisation of BroV provided an opportunity to produce recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits for use in research and surveillance. Such reagents proved valuable in the experimental identification of the fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein p13 that is responsible for the syncytia observed in BroV-infected cells. Despite the low amino acid sequence identity between the FAST proteins of different orthoreovirus species they possess conserved structural features that have been implicated in biological function. Of these conserved features, the BroV p13 protein is predicted to possess one transmembrane domain, a C-terminal polybasic region, a C-terminal hydrophobic patch and an N-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence. The unique repertoire and arrangement of sequence-predicted structural features identified in p13 indicate that it is a novel fifth member of the FAST protein family. The BroV-specific immunological reagents were also used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suitable for serological screening. A survey of flying-foxes from Papua New Guinea (PNG) revealed that BroV or BroV-like viruses are currently circulating in these animals. This demonstrates that BroV is not limited to the Australian continent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Broome virus, new orthoreovirus species, fusogenic, fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein, flying-fox, bat, emerging viruses</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205717</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facts, Fiction, Romance and Propaganda &#8211; The Complex Nature of the Sources for Alexander&#8217;s Subjugation of India</field><field name="creator">Michael Welch</field><field name="description">Abstract This dissertation demonstrates that the ancient source traditions which furnish historians with information concerning Alexander the Great&#8217;s subjugation of India are deeply complex and often underappreciated as being such. This is done through a systematic analysis of the various extant and fragmentary traditions surrounding this period. Therefore, the evidence of the authors who wrote about Alexander&#8217;s Indian campaign directly after, or within a generation or so of it, are first discussed. This involves primarily a study of the extant fragments of many of the men who accompanied Alexander himself. This is followed by an investigation into the so-called &#8216;secondary authors&#8217;, or our extant histories of Alexander. The focus here is on evaluating the transmission of detail, bias, and distortion through the various aims, methods and prejudices of these later historians. Following this, there is a discussion of the numismatic evidence relating to the Indian campaign. This involves a study of Alexander&#8217;s &#8216;elephant medallions&#8217; and various coins of the Diadochoi in which the intricacies of our documentary evidence is made evident. Finally, there is included in this dissertation a case study in which the problematic nature of the ancient evidence surrounding this period of the great conqueror&#8217;s life is shown.

They are very important ecologically, economically and socially, but are subject to increasing deleterious disturbances. To protect coral reefs and manage the sustainable use of their resources it is necessary to understand how coral communities respond to disturbances and to use this understanding to project the likely ecological trajectories of disturbed coral reefs in spatial and temporal contexts. Three powerful tools exist to address this issue: (1) in situ monitoring that describes ecological transitions of coral communities at very fine spatial scale; (2) time-series of maps derived from high spatial resolution remote sensing images that provide multi-temporal synoptic views of the reefs; and (3) spatially- and temporally-explicit models that are able to handle ecosystems complexity and represent their spatial dynamics. The combination of these three tools to map and monitor coral communities remained to be addressed. This dissertation developed an integrative approach to characterise, map and model coral communities&#8217; responses to disturbances. This approach provides a basis for monitoring coral reefs at temporal and spatial scales matched to disturbance impacts and coral reefs patchiness. This was achieved by investigating the dynamics of three different Indo-Pacific reefs and by following four steps: - Developing and applying a method to characterise how detailed coral communities can be mapped before and after a major cyclone event from a short time-series of high spatial resolution images (IKONOS, Quickbird) on Abor&#233; Reef (New-Caledonia); - Using the methods developed in the first step to assess whether decadal-scale coral dynamics can be retraced and monitored from time-series of aerial photographs and satellite images spanning at least 30 years on Saint-Leu (R&#233;union Island) and Heron (Australia) Reefs; - Developing a spatially- and temporally-explicit model of coral communities&#8217; dynamics with cellular agent-based formalism on the western section of Heron reef flat; and - Assessing the relevance of the mapping, monitoring and modelling tools developed in this work, into an integrated approach for coral reef monitoring. For the first step, accurate monitoring requires that descriptions of the reef features are coherent with the local scale of disturbance impacts in space and time. While such a monitoring paradigm is applied in terrestrial environments, it is not the case for coral reefs. A before-after cyclone time-series of satellite images from Abor&#233; Reef was used to test this paradigm on coral reefs. In situ data provided a new three-level hierarchical coral community typology (45 classes at the finest level). Photo-interpretation and hierarchical mapping methods were applied to an IKONOS image and a Quickbird image taken before and after cyclone Erica respectively. Application of this paradigm yielded a highly detailed multi-temporal maps of pre- and post-cyclone coral communities and recommendations to design reef-scale monitoring protocols. For the second step, the temporal scale of monitoring projects needs also to match the inherent reef dynamics. To assess the applicability of this temporal component of the paradigm at a decadal scale, the hierarchical mapping approaches developed for Abor&#233; Reef were applied to a 33-year time-series of satellite images (two Quickbird images) and airborne photographs (five scanned images) of Saint-Leu Reef. The mapping approach overcame challenges due to different images qualities and to the lack of in situ observations in time and space before cyclone Firinga in 1989. This demonstrated the potential for further applications of the approach in reef monitoring protocols based on complementary in situ and remote sensing data to help understand the dynamics of reef-top coral reef communities and geomorphology over years to decades. In the next step, the modelling component of this work focused on a proof-of-concept for spatially-explicit modelling of coral growth by simulating maps of reef flat colonisation on a 16 686 m2 section of Heron Reef. To do this a 35-year time-series of two satellite Quickbird pan-sharpened images and five aerial photographs of Heron Reef was first used to hierarchically map and quantify the areal expansion of coral on the reef flat. The coral growth was driven by several artificially induced local sea-level rises associated with engineering works on the reef flat. Vertical and horizontal growth rates were quantified in terms of percentage of the total area colonised each year by corals. Coral community maps and coral growth rates estimated from the image time-series were used to constrain an accretive cellular growth model. Although only preliminary the model produced coral growth likelihood maps corresponding to observed fine-scale coral growth patterns. This suggested the tool had promise for further applications in reef management. This dissertation developed an integrative approach to characterise, map and model coral communities&#8217; responses to disturbances, providing a basis for monitoring coral reefs at ecological, temporal, and spatial scales matching the patchiness of the communities&#8217; distribution and disturbance impacts. The contributions of the work to the applied fields of coral reef mapping, modelling and monitoring were demonstrated through the results achieved and the development of protocols that do not require specialized image processing algorithms and methods. This opens perspectives for further development of the approach on other coral reefs around the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Coral reef community</field><field name="subject">coral morphology</field><field name="subject">disturbance</field><field name="subject">multi-temporal maps</field><field name="subject">Quickbird</field><field name="subject">IKONOS</field><field name="subject">aerial photographs</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">coral growth cellular agent-based model</field><field name="subject">predictive likelihood maps</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205798</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of trust in community acceptance of urban water management schemes: A social-psychological model of the characteristics and determinants of trust and acceptance</field><field name="creator">Victoria Ross</field><field name="description">Given the important role that trust plays in acceptance of water management schemes, the current research investigated the characteristics and determinants of trust by developing a social-psychological model of trust in the area of water management and reuse. The research advanced a theoretical understanding of trust by using social identity theory and the relational model of trust as a framework and providing a systematic examination of the relationships between the variables in the hypothesised trust model. The proposed trust model was tested across three potentially different perceived risk contexts; low, medium and high. Analysis through path modelling provided strong support for the hypothesised model. In all three contexts trust in the water authority was a significant predictor of acceptance of the water management scheme, and risk perceptions mediated the relationship between trust and acceptance. In other words higher levels of trust in the authority were associated with lower perceptions of risk, which were in turn associated with higher levels of acceptance. In Study 4, which was set in the high perceived risk context of the proposed indirect potable reuse scheme in Toowoomba, perceptions of risk had the strongest direct effect on acceptance of the scheme, and the trust, risk and acceptance relationship was stronger than it was in the other studies. The relational variables of procedural fairness, identification with one&#8217;s community, ingroup membership of the water authority and a social bond (shared values) with the water authority were all found to impact on trust, either directly or indirectly. In addition, the instrumental variable of the credibility of the authority (measured as technical competence and a lack of vested interests) was found to have a significant impact on trust. Taken together, the results provide support for social identity theory and the relational model of trust as a framework for understanding trust in authorities. The results are also consistent with literature that suggests that the relational and instrumental models of trust are not incompatible (e.g., Edwards &amp; Kidd, 2003; Tyler &amp; Kramer, 1996). The findings from this research program clearly have a practical application for improving acceptance of water management schemes. The combined results demonstrate the importance of trust in the water authority in reducing perceived risk and thus increasing acceptance of schemes. The results highlight the need for water authorities and policy makers to build public trust through procedural fairness, building a sense of the water authority as a member of the community, and through demonstrating technical competence and concern for the interests of the public.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trust, risk perceptions, public acceptance, recycled water, social identity, procedural fairness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205811</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microbiology of coral disease on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Meegan Henderson</field><field name="description">Coral disease represents one of the many challenges facing coral reefs, and is a contributing factor to the overall decline in coral reef health worldwide. An increase in disease frequency, outbreaks and the emergence of new diseases has fuelled much concern over the impact of coral diseases and subsequently prompted research into their possible causes. Our understanding of putative coral pathogens has lagged behind the emergence of coral disease as a major threat to the health of coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the largest contiguous reef in the world, and is still regarded as one the healthiest and best managed coral reef ecosystems in existence today. Despite this, the frequency of coral disease has begun to increase sharply over the past decade, prompting researchers to focus on the aetiology, causal factors and ecological impact of coral disease within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). This PhD thesis focused on two distinct disease elements: brown band (BrB) and white syndrome (WS). These two diseases affect corals within the GBRMP, yet their microbiology and ecology is largely unknown. The research project investigated the microbiology and ecology of WS and BrB affecting acroporids, using culture-dependent and independent methods to characterise the microbial community associated with healthy and diseased corals and identify putative coral pathogens. The lifecycle and diurnal cycles of BrB ciliates were also explored to gain a greater understanding of the effect of these ciliates on coral health. Ecological surveys were carried out at Heron Island sites commonly used for the collection of corals to ascertain the prevalence and significance of these diseases in the context of laboratory results. Surveys at five sites revealed a mean prevalence of 8.11% of tabular acroporids affected by WS, which is consistent with previous studies. BrB revealed a much lower prevalence of less than 0.04%. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from Acropora hyacinthus samples derived from a healthy control colony, and a healthy section and lesion border of a WS affected colony. Distinct shifts in the microbial community and partitioning between the lesion border and healthy section of the diseased colony were observed. In addition, the healthy section of the diseased colony displayed a different microbial community to the control colony, supporting previous data that a microbial shift occurs preceding visible signs of infection. A number of bacteria from the healthy section of diseased coral shared close sequence affiliations to a number of Vibrio spp., including potentially pathogenic Vibrio species. Sequences retrieved from the lesion border of WS affected Acropora hyacinthus were dominated by Pseudoalteromonas spp., although these species have not been previously implicated in coral disease. The coral disease BrB is characterised by the presence of a brown ciliate band and these ciliates have been identified as a new species belonging to the class Oligohymenophorea, subclass Scuticociliatia. Within BrB-affected Acropora muricata, numerous filamentous, coccoid and rod bacteria were observed to be closely associated with the ciliate band, but absent in coral tissue adjacent to the typical brown band. It is unknown whether the bacteria associated with the mass of ciliates are the primary pathogens, a food source for the ciliates or simply opportunistic pathogens. Several isolates retrieved from BrB corals were tested for their pathogenicity in controlled infection trials using Acropora muricata. The preliminary results identified at least two isolates of interest (CC1 and HB-8). However, the results of a replicated infection trial failed to conclusively identify the bacteria as the causative agents of this disease. The findings from the cross-infection trials and ecological surveys suggest that BrB is an infectious but not highly contagious coral disease. This study revealed important aspects of both WS and BrB that were previously unknown. The research carried out has built a greater understanding, and a platform for future research directed at understanding key processes involved in these coral diseases. This research has highlighted the need for ongoing infection trials in diseases, even when a pathogen has been identified. The discovery of possible key bacterial species involved in WS and BrB warrants further research aimed at understanding the mechanisms in which bacteria may affect the coral holobiont. In conclusion, this research has further supported the notion that corals are a complex community with bacterial, animal and protistan partners, which when disturbed may see one or several of the previous benign partners becoming pathogenic. In a rapidly changing climate, this conclusion is consistent with the idea that coral diseases are on the rise due to changing environmental circumstances disturbing the balance between these interdependent partners.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brown band</field><field name="subject">ciliate</field><field name="subject">coral disease</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">white syndrome</field><field name="subject">16S rRNA genes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205958</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomimetic Orientated Total Synthesis of Neovibsane Natural Products and Comparison of Synthetic Neovibsanes on Neurite Outgrowth Promotion in PC12 Cells</field><field name="creator">Annette Chen</field><field name="description">Neovibsanin A and B are natural products which induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. They belong in the neovibsane class under the rare vibsane natural product family, whose structures are characterized by polycyclic, polyoxygenated cores. Based on a proposed biosynthesis, the synthetic strategy towards neovibsanin A and B involved synthesizing a key enone intermediate. Initial investigation using this intermediate lead to the total synthesis of 2-O-methylneovibsanin H. Crucial to this concise synthesis was an acid-catalyzed, one-pot, four-step cascade reaction. Modifying the reaction condition leads to a different five-step cascade pathway, resulting in the total synthesis of 4,5-bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B. The synthetic trials and tribulations encountered on the road to these final compounds are explored. It is envisaged that other related neovibsane natural products may arise based on this synthetic sequence. 4,5-Bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B, as well as several other structural analogues collected during the synthesis, were biologically assayed using NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. All compounds induced a significant proportion of neurons to extend neurite processes compared to control cultures. The structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the tricyclic core, as well as the 3,3-dimethylacroyl enol ester side chain, may be responsible for promoting a biological response.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neovibsanin a</field><field name="subject">neovibsanin b</field><field name="subject">2-O-methylneovibsanin h</field><field name="subject">biological activity</field><field name="subject">neurite outgrowth</field><field name="subject">natural product</field><field name="subject">total synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205965</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of diet on plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and free fatty acid concentrations in healthy dogs</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Elliott</field><field name="description">Diabetes mellitus is a frequent endocrinopathy in dogs. Exogenous insulin and nutritional management are the mainstays of therapy. High carbohydrate and fibre diets have been traditionally recommended for canine diabetes mellitus. However, recent studies in healthy and diabetic dogs have challenged the use of these traditional diabetic diets. In addition, dietary carbohydrate content was found to be the main determinant of postprandial blood glucose concentrations over 1.5 hours in healthy dogs. Increasing carbohydrate content increased blood glucose concentration. In a search of the literature, no studies in dogs were found comparing the effects on postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations of a traditionally recommended high carbohydrate and fibre diabetes diet with a moderate carbohydrate and fibre diet, or a commercially-available maintenance diet. Although fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations are commonly used for diagnosis and management of canine hyperlipidemia, a review of the literature found that in human beings, it may not to be predictive of the highest postprandial concentration. Importantly, in overweight and obese dogs with postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations &gt;5 mmol/L (&gt;445 mg/dL), it was found there was a 6 fold increase in risk of laboratory evidence of exocrine pancreatic disease. However, there are limited studies on the effect of maintenance diets on postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations in dogs, and no reference intervals determined for a triglyceride meal challenge test in healthy dogs. For the dietary studies in this thesis, animal welfare was of paramount importance, and minimally invasive peripheral venous catheterization and blood collection techniques were needed to collect 4 mL blood samples over 13 hours in conscious dogs. A search of the literature found no studies evaluating the reliability of using peripheral catheterization via the cephalic vein for the collection of larger blood volumes (for example, 4 mL). The aims of this thesis were firstly, to investigate the influence of three diets with varying carbohydrate and fibre content on postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations in healthy dogs over 12 hours; secondly, to develop a triglyceride meal challenge test and associated reference intervals; and finally, to evaluate a minimally invasive catheterization and blood collection technique for reliability in collecting the blood volumes required for these studies. For the studies in this thesis, twelve healthy dogs were fed each of three diets for three weeks in a three period cross-over design. For the meal response test at the end of each three-week period, 10 blood samples were collected over 13 hours. Reference intervals for fasting and postprandial triglyceride concentrations at single and multiple time points after eating a standard meal were determined in healthy dogs. Associations between fasting and postprandial triglyceride concentrations, and time to measure highest postprandial triglyceride concentration were also evaluated. Blood volume obtained, resistance on aspirating the blood sample, and methods used to improve blood flow during collection were recorded for the 358 samples collected. The results of the studies in this thesis demonstrated that a moderate carbohydrate diet resulted in lower peak and postprandial glucose concentrations compared with a traditional diabetic diet (CHO 55 %ME) and a maintenance diet (CHO 45 %ME). Fasting triglyceride concentrations were found not to be predictive of peak postprandial triglyceride concentrations. The highest triglyceride concentration measured at 2, 5, and 6 hours after eating had the closest agreement with peak postprandial triglyceride concentration. Glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations in some dogs were significantly above baseline concentrations at 12 hours after eating each of the diets. Of 358 blood samples collected, 93 % achieved the required 4 mL volume, while the remaining samples were greater than 1.5 mL, and 87 % were obtained with minimal resistance. It was concluded that the moderate carbohydrate and fibre test diet warrants evaluation in diabetic dogs. It was found that when following the same protocol, blood samples should be collected 2, 5, and 6 hours after eating to determine the highest postprandial plasma triglyceride concentration. For future nutritional studies, dogs may need to be fasted for at least 12 hours, and analytes measured over at least 12 hours after feeding to evaluate fasting and postprandial plasma analyte concentrations. Finally it was demonstrated that percutaneous catheterization of the cephalic vein using a 20-gauge catheter allows for successful collection of multiple 4 mL blood samples over 13 hours in conscious dogs. This thesis presents new information for future nutritional studies in healthy and diabetic dogs by suggesting that there may be no glycemic benefit feeding the high carbohydrate and fibre diet compared with a moderate carbohydrate and fibre diet. A triglyceride meal challenge test was developed to assist the diagnosis of canine hyperlipidemia. Finally, a minimally invasive method for obtaining serial blood samples was evaluated and described. These findings are expected to help in designing future studies in the nutritional management in healthy dogs, and dogs with diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">Dogs</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrate content</field><field name="subject">Fiber content</field><field name="subject">Fat content</field><field name="subject">postprandial</field><field name="subject">Glucose</field><field name="subject">Insulin</field><field name="subject">Triglyceride</field><field name="subject">Free Fatty-acids</field><field name="subject">Meal challenge test</field><field name="subject">Reference intervals</field><field name="subject">Peripheral venous catheterization</field><field name="subject">Serial blood sample collection</field><field name="subject">Cephalic vein</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206143</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFLUENCE OF LONG WAVES AND WAVE GROUPS ON SWASH ZONE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CROSS-SHORE BEACH PROFILE EVOLUTION</field><field name="creator">Son Kim Pham</field><field name="description">There are only a few detailed measurements of the cross-shore variation in the net sediment transport and beach evolution for single or multiple swash events, and no data showing the influence of long waves and wave groups on swash zone morphology. Novel laboratory experiments and numerical modeling have been performed to study the influence of long waves and bichromatic wave groups on sediment transport and beach morphodynamics in the swash zone. Due to complex processes, difficulties in measuring, and very significant difficulties in isolating the morphodynamic processes induced by long waves and wave groups on natural beaches, a laboratory study was designed to measure in very high detail the bathymetric evolution of model sand beaches under monochromatic waves, long wave and short wave composites (free long waves), and bichromatic wave groups (forced long waves). Net sediment transport, Q(x), and beach morphology changes under the monochromatic waves were analyzed and compared to conditions with and without the free long waves, and then compared with the bichromatic wave groups. A range of wave conditions, e.g., high energy, moderate energy, and low energy waves, were used to obtain beach evolution ranging from accretionary to erosive, and including intermediate beach states. Hydrodynamics parameters, e.g., instantaneous water depths, wave amplitudes, run-up and rundown, were also measured to study and test a sediment transport model for the swash zone, based on modifying the energetic-bedload based sediment transport equations with suspended sediment. The experimental data clearly demonstrate that for the monochromatic wave conditions, beach evolution develops erosion for high steepness waves and accretion for lower steepness waves. The model beach profile evolutions are similar to natural beaches, and form and develop bars and berms over time. Adding a free long wave to the short wave in the composite wave results in changes to the overall trend of erosion/accretion of the beach profile, but the net transport pattern does not change significantly. The short wave strongly dominates beach behavior and the net transport rate, instead of the free long wave in the composite wave. The free long wave, however, carries more water and sediment onshore, leading to an increase in shoreline motion and wave run-up further landward. The long wave influences the structure and position of the swash bar/berm, which generally tends to move onshore and forms a larger swash bar/berm for higher long wave amplitudes. The free long wave also increases overall onshore sediment transport, and reduces offshore transport for erosive conditions. The long wave tends to protect the beach face and enhances onshore transport for accretive conditions, especially in the swash zone. In contrast, for bichromatic wave groups having the same mean energy flux as their corresponding monochromatic wave, the influence on sediment transports is generally offshore in both the surf and swash zone instead of onshore. The swash berm is, however, formed further landward compared with the berm of the corresponding monochromatic wave. The sediment transport patterns (erosion or accretion) generated by the bichromatic wave group or corresponding monochromatic wave are similar, but differ in magnitude. The numerical model, starting in the inner surf zone to reduce the effect of poor breaker description in the non-linear shallow water equations, can produce a good match between observed data and the modeled hydrodynamics parameters in the SZ. The sediment transport model shows the important role of suspended sediment in the swash zone. In contrast with the observed data, energetic-based bed-load models predict offshore sediment transport for most wave conditions because of negative skewness. The modified sediment transport model, with added suspended sediment terms and optimized coefficients, produces a good match between model results and observed data for each wave condition, especially for low frequency monochromatic waves. The optimized coefficient set corresponding to particular monochromatic wave conditions can be used to predict the net sediment transport quite well for some composite wave conditions. Overall, the same optimized coefficient sets can be applied to predict the correct overall trend of net transport for most composite wave conditions. However, the predicted net transport for the bichromatic wave groups does not match well with the overall net transport patterns. There is no set of single transport coefficients that can be used to predict sediment transport for all wave conditions. This suggests that the present sediment transport models cannot predict evolution correctly, even for conditions which represent only perturbation from those for which they were calibrated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sediment transport, beach morphodynamics, swash zone, monochromatic waves, composite wave, bichromatic wave group, sediment transport modeling.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206178</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The &#8216;Historically Informed Performance&#8217; Movement and its Influence on Violoncello Playing Since 1981: With Reference to Performances of Haydn&#8217;s Violoncello Concerto in C major by Anner Byslma, Pieter Wispelwey and Yo-Yo Ma</field><field name="creator">Courtenay Lind</field><field name="description">Investigation of the historically informed performance movement with regard to its influence on violoncello playing since 1981 is approached in this critical commentary through the analysis of three different interpretations of Haydn&#8217;s Cello Concerto in C major. These interpretations are recordings by prominent cellists who have influenced or been influenced by the rise in popularity of the historically informed performance movement, namely Anner Bylsma, Pieter Wispelwey and Yo-Yo Ma. The critical commentary includes a brief summary of the musical careers of each individual and reports on the publicity surrounding them in an attempt to discover each performer&#8217;s views on the importance of historical performance practice and the extent to which these views are reflected in their performances. In order to establish what constitutes a historically informed interpretation of Haydn&#8217;s Cello Concerto, this document provides a brief background to the historical performance movement and also to the work itself. In the critical commentary, this work is analysed in relation to six specific aspects of historically informed interpretation: instrumentation, pitch, vibrato, tempo, ornamentation and cadential improvisation. By examining and comparing these aspects in the aforementioned twentieth-century recordings, this critical commentary concludes in support of Taruskin&#8217;s (1984) position on the now fashionable debate of historical performance practice. Namely, that the historical performance movement has been influenced as much by modern taste and aesthetics as by the attempt to create historically &#8216;accurate&#8217; music.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violoncello</field><field name="subject">historically informed performance practice</field><field name="subject">Bylsma</field><field name="subject">Wispelwey</field><field name="subject">Ma</field><field name="subject">Haydn</field><field name="subject">concerto</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206315</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic analysis of solar desalination technology in agricultural greenhouses</field><field name="creator">Ucgul, Mustafa</field><field name="description">Water is a vital element of agriculture. Almost 75% of the world's water resources are used for farm irrigation. Using greenhouses in agriculture provides a good environment for plant growth and reduces water consumption. Desalination to obtain freshwater from seawater or brackish water has been used in the arid costal regions and areas that have encountered water shortages. Solar desalination systems integrated into greenhouses have been considered for fresh water production to satisfy their water demand. Two main types of greenhouse integrated desalination systems are used, namely, solar stills and greenhouse-integrated humidification-dehumidification type solar systems. The main objective of this project is to carry out a thermodynamic analysis and a comparison of solar stills and humidification-dehumidification type desalination units. The basic principles, components, types, advantages and disadvantages of solar stills and humidification-dehumidification type greenhouse integrated desalination systems were investigated in detail. A conventional single basin type solar still that includes a basin and a symmetrical tilted condensing cover (greenhouse roof), and a humidification- dehumidification desalination unit that consists of two evaporators and one condenser were selected for detailed analysis. In order to carry out the thermal analysis, some important data such as plant transpiration and evaporation, solar radiation and indoor conditions of the greenhouse were determined. The thermal analysis was based on tomato production. Typical year ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity values were taken from TRNSYS 16 for Adelaide conditions. In order to provide a good environment for the tomato crops, the internal conditions of the greenhouse were selected in the range 15-29oC temperature and 60-80% relative humidity. Detailed mathematical thermal models of both conventional solar stills and the new humidification-dehumidification type systems were simulated and the fresh water production of both systems was evaluated by means of MATLAB 7.8. The results were compared with previous experimental results. The results demonstrated that even if the whole roof area is used, the required fresh water supply cannot be produced in the months of May, June and July by the simple solar still system, whereas adequate amounts of fresh water can be produced throughout the year by means of humidification-dehumidification type system. On the other hand, the annual water production of the simple solar still system and humidification-dehumidification type system were determined as 308.5 and 260 m3/year respectively. The thesis also considers the option of water storage for providing water requirement of the greenhouse plants. The parameters that affect the fresh water requirement of the both systems were also considered and their impact evaluated. The effects of the desalination system on the internal environment of the greenhouse were also considered. It was revealed from the results that the use of the solar still system during the period from April to October causes unsuitable greenhouse conditions for the greenhouse crops whilst appropriate conditions for the greenhouse crops were achieved throughout the year in the case of the humidification-dehumidification type system. On these and other grounds, the humidification-dehumidification type system was found more suitable for the given greenhouse and climatic conditions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291802 Heat and Mass Transfer Operations</field><field name="subject">299999 Engineering and Technology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">solar desalination</field><field name="subject">agricultural greenhouse</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/97531</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46170</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising regrinding chemistry</field><field name="creator">Ye, Xiangfei</field><field name="description">The chemistry during regrinding is critical to flotation.

The rationale was to determine whether endurance athletes are able to maintain energy and protein balance over periods of increased EE and whether parameters of energy and protein balance related to markers of overtraining  Methods  Two research projects were conducted, the first at the Tour of Southland cycle event (5 high performance male cyclists) and the second at an Ironman training camp (7 male Ironman athletes). In both studies EE was determined by the DLW technique and EI by supervised weighed diet records. Protein balance was determined by an 18-hour primed continuous infusion of 13C-leucine at the Tour of Southland and via the traditional 24-hour nitrogen balance technique at the Ironman camp. Both techniques were performed prior to and immediately after the given event. Nude body weight, blood overtraining parameters, urine samples and a mood questionnaire were collected in the mornings for analysis of daily parameters.  Results  The Tour of Southland: Subjects maintained energy balance with a mean EI of 27.3&#177;3.8 MJ/day and a mean EE of 27.4 &#177; 2.0 MJ/day. There was no significant change in protein breakdown or parameters of overtraining. Ironman Training Camp: Athletes maintained energy balance with a mean EI of 20.27&#177;2.91 MJ/day and a mean EE of 20.5&#177;3.4 MJ/day and nitrogen balance was positive. There were indications of a relationship between energy and protein balance and markers of overtraining in both studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5811</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori issues for remediation of bio-hazards, chemo-hizards and natural disasters : a thesis completed in part satisfaction of a Masters in Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Webber, Chris</field><field name="description">This study sets out: 1.

The sets are related to the residue difference sets that were first discussed in detail in 1953 by Emma Lehmer. Qualified difference sets consist of a set of residues modulo an integer v and they possess attractive properties that suggest potential applications in areas such as image formation, signal processing and aperture synthesis. This thesis outlines the theory behind qualified difference sets and gives conditions for the existence and nonexistence of these sets in various cases. A special case of the qualified difference sets is the qualified residue difference sets. These consist of the set of nth power residues of certain types of prime. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of qualified residue difference sets are derived and the precise conditions for the existence of these sets are given for n = 2, 4 and 6. Qualified residue difference sets are proved nonexistent for n = 8, 10, 12, 14 and 18. A generalisation of the qualified residue difference sets is introduced. These are the qualified difference sets composed of unions of cyclotomic classes. A cyclotomic class is defined for an integer power n and the results of an exhaustive computer search are presented for n = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Two new families of qualified difference set were discovered in the case n = 8 and some isolated systems were discovered for n = 6, 10 and 12. An explanation of how qualified difference sets may be implemented in physical applications is given and potential applications are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">residue difference sets</field><field name="subject">cyclotomic class</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230102 Number theory and field theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1204</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel analytical techniques for studying the milk fat globule membrane : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Evers, Jacobus Meindert</field><field name="description">Video files: Some images may require stereoscopic glasses</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk fat</field><field name="subject">Fat globule properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1480</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology and control of leptospirosis in farmed deer in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Clinical Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ayanegui Alc&#233;rreca, Mar&#237;a Alejandra</field><field name="description">Missing pages 93, 264 &amp; 313 from electronic and Vault (preservation) copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hardjobovis</field><field name="subject">Pomona</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1470</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shared Responsibility for the Enforcement of International Criminal Law</field><field name="creator">Niemann, Grant Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with &#145;international criminal law&#146;.

However, this reduced ability of injured CNS neurons to regenerate can be improved by under certain conditions. For instance, in adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, injury to its peripheral branch (unilateral conditioning lesion) prior to injury of its central DRG branch (dorsal column cut) enhances the intrinsic capability of some but not all CNS afferent neurons to regenerate. The exact mechanism mediating this type of response is not known. However, previous studies by other groups have proposed that the regeneration of these CNS afferent neurons might be associated with the inflammatory response following injury to the peripheral DRG branch. Our general aim, was to examine the involvement of the immune response in the regeneration of the CNS DRG branch, as part of the pre-conditioned lesion model. To test this, three questions/hypotheses were investigated. 

Firstly, we investigated the effects of vaccination in pre-conditioned lesion animals using a peripheral nerve homogenate (PNH, sciatic nerve) as the immunogen. Given the regenerative capabilities of peripheral nerves, we proposed that exposure to this homogenate could enhance the limited regeneration of CNS fibres, after pre-conditioning of DRG neurons. Our results showed that in adult and/or neonatal Sprague Dawley (SD) rats PNH-vaccinated, had greater number of regenerated fibres, as compared to injury matched saline-vaccinated controls. Conversely, passive exposure to PNH through parental vaccination resulted in the suppression of this regenerative trigger. This suppressed competence of CNS fibres to regenerate was indirectly correlated with a reduced number of macrophage cells throughout the SCI epicentre, as compared to greater macrophage numbers found in the adult and/or neonatal treated groups.

Secondly, we explored the possibility that a systemic inflammatory effect originating from the peripheral conditioning lesion, might be able to contribute to the regeneration of other injured neurons within the matured CNS. Again, using adult SD rats, we pre-conditioned the peripheral DRG branch as previous and changed the location of the CNS injury from the spinal cord to the optic nerve. Where alike any other injured neuron within the CNS, fails to regenerate. Unfortunately, our results from anterograde or retrograde labelling did not find any regenerated optic nerve fibres, although, we did find macrophage numbers to be higher in pre-conditioned lesion animals as compared to sham-operated animals. Therefore, it is possible that the pre-conditioning peripheral lesion might be allowing for a greater macrophage infiltration into the CNS compartment.

Finally, we determined whether an early macrophage infiltration into the CNS compartment could be correlated with the observed CNS regeneration, characteristic of the pre-conditioned lesion model. To test this, we temporarily depleted macrophages before, during and after peripheral nerve lesion, via liposomal clodronate delivery. Our results from anterograde and retrograde labelling of spinal cord fibres revealed no regenerated CNS fibres in macrophage depleted animals, only in injury matched controls. 

In conclusion, macrophage cells play a beneficial role in the regeneration of CNS afferent fibres of pre-conditioned lesion DRG neurons. This most likely occurs through activation of intrinsic somatic DRG responses, as well as, an increased macrophage activation. We believe this inflammatory response to be of favourable phenotypic characteristic to the regeneration of injured CNS neurons, especially those in proximity to the DRG cell body. In addition, we propose that the conditioning peripheral lesion permits an influx of macrophage cells into the CNS compartment before injury of the CNS DRG branch, which is also likely to be supporting regeneration of afferent fibres. Future studies should evaluate the possibility that activated inflammatory cells might be infiltrating into the CNS under minimal blood-brain barrier disruption. It is clear that a complex communication between the nervous and immune system is occurring after the initial peripheral injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spinal cord injury</field><field name="subject">Pre-conditioned lesion</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">macrophage cells</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100621.024316</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia.

The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dangerous liaisons : enterprise rationality, nursing practice and the regulation of hospital care to older people</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Maria</field><field name="description">Population ageing has been posed as a problem for contemporary governing in relation to the allocation and consumption of finite health care resources, in particular acute hospital care. This thesis explores how nursing practice is a key resource in the management of this ???problem???. Employing Foucault???s concept of governmentality, nursing practice is examined as a form of social government that is central to the regulation of hospital care to older people. A governmentality approach enables consideration of the relationship between the macro political context of governing, as embodied in prevailing political rationalities, and their outworking beyond the arenas of formal government in the micro practices of nurses. Specifically, in this research, it reveals how contemporary entrepreneurial rationalities of governing work at a distance to discursively shape the local practices of nurses in the regulation of hospital care to older people. Discourse analysis of interview texts, literature and documents revealed how enterprise rationality was invested in the discourses circulating in the study site, highlighting the power relationships and subject positions available to registered nurses and outcomes produced in the regulation of hospital care to older people. The analysis details how registered nurses activated a range of technologies and practices as they engaged with enterprise discourses, constituting nursing practice as an activity aimed at making up older people as dischargeable subjects. It shows how enterprise is both a practice and way of thinking that directs us toward a particular truth of hospital, hence nursing, care of older people. The thesis illustrates how changes in the ways of governing hospitals have actively transformed the meaning and practice of nursing in the provision of hospital care to older people. It shows how the values and practices that make entrepreneurial modes of government possible penetrate each layer of an organisation and can create new mentalities or ways of thinking. This was evident in this research whereby an entrepreneurial mode of governance had re-imagined the social practice of nursing as a form of the economic, such that neither recovery, nor health, but discharge assumed pre-eminence as the focus and aim of hospital care for older people and hence the goal of nursing practice. These findings suggest that hospital care of older people has become a political and economic, rather than therapeutic concern. Furthermore, nursing interventions in the hospital care of older people have become administrative rather than therapeutic, with nursing practice focused on individual older people only insofar as they are constituted as part of a population at risk of delayed discharge. The thesis contends that nurses are implicated in the politics of health care in new and different ways amid entrepreneurial rationalities of governing that promote an ethos of risk management, individualism and responsibilisation in relation to health. It argues that the replacement of an ethos of nursing as care based on client need with an ethos of nursing as risk management substitutes the therapeutic intent and practices of nursing with the technical intent of managing risk. In so doing, the thesis illustrates dangers and possibilities arising from the re-framing of health care through entrepreneurial modes of governance. It enables a critically informed consideration of what kind of practice acute care nursing could be into the future and how nurses and others can take action to positively contribute to the futures of older people they provide care to.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">239903 Risk Theory</field><field name="subject">321007 Geriatrics and Gerontology</field><field name="subject">321103 Clinical Nursing: Secondary (Acute Care)</field><field name="subject">321106 Aged Care Nursing</field><field name="subject">acute hospital care</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">Foucualt</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/97568</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46176</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative efficacy of endodontic medicaments against Enterococcus faecalis biofilms.</field><field name="creator">Plutzer, Barbara</field><field name="description">It is well established that bacteria cause pulpal and periradicular disease (Kakehashi et al. 1965). Of the bacteria recovered from failing root canals, Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most prevalent species (Molander et al. 1998; Sundqvist et al. 1998). Many laboratory studies have investigated the effectiveness of root canal irrigants and medicaments against E. faecalis. Most used planktonic cultures, which are not representative of the in vivo growth conditions of an infected root canal system, where bacteria grow as a biofilm adhering to the dentinal wall (Nair 1987). Organisation of bacteria within biofilms confers a range of phenotypic properties that are not evident in their planktonic counterparts, including a markedly reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial killing (Wilson 1996). Objectives: The aims of this study were: 1) To compare the efficacy of commonly used endodontic medicaments against E. faecalis cultured as a biofilm. The medicaments tested were Ledermix paste, calcium hydroxide, Odontopaste, 0.2% chlorhexidine gel and 50:50 combinations of Ledermix/calcium hydroxide and Odontopaste/calcium hydroxide. 2) To compare the antimicrobial effect achieved through exposure to endodontic medicaments with that achieved by exposure to a constant concentration of sodium hypochlorite for varying times. Methods: A biofilm was established using a continuous flow cell. E. faecalis inoculum was introduced into the flow cell and allowed to establish on human dentine slices over 4 weeks. Each test medicament was introduced into the flow cell for a period of 24 or 48 hours, while sodium hypochlorite was evaluated after 1, 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Biofilms were harvested by sonication in sterile PBS. Cellular protein levels were measured to quantitate the amount of biofilm harvested. Cellular viability was determined using serial plating. The number of colony forming units was then adjusted for cellular protein levels to allow treatment protocols to be compared. Qualitative SEM analyses of the biofilm was performed following exposure to each test agent. Results: Sodium hypochlorite was the only agent that achieved total bacterial elimination. Ledermix and Odontopaste had no significant effect on the E. faecalis biofilm, while calcium hydroxide and 50:50 combinations of calcium hydroxide with either Ledermix or Odontopaste were able to reduce viability by &gt; 99%. Conclusion: When used in isolation, antibiotic containing medicaments had no appreciable effect on the viability of Enterococcus faecalis. Sodium hypochlorite remains the gold standard for bacterial elimination in root canal therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endodontic medicaments; Enterococcus faecalis; biofilm</field><field name="subject">Endodontics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56427</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimentally induced cortical plasticity: neurophysiological and functional correlates in health and disease.</field><field name="creator">Schabrun, Siobhan M.</field><field name="description">Neuroplasticity provides the basis for many of our most fundamental processes including learning, memory and the recovery of function following injury. This thesis is concerned with the neurophysiological and functional correlates of sensorimotor neuroplasticity in the healthy and focal dystonic populations. My initial experiments were conducted to determine the functional correlates of neuroplasticity induced in the primary motor (M1) and primary sensory (S1) cortices during a grip lift task. In healthy subjects these experiments further quantified the role of M1 in the anticipatory control of grip force scaling and demonstrated a role for S1 in triggering subsequent phases of the motor plan. My second series of experiments served to extend these findings by examining the functional correlates of neuroplasticity induced in the supplementary motor area (SMA). This study provided evidence for the role of left SMA in the control of grip force scaling and a role for left and right SMA in the synchronization of grip force and load force during the grip-lift synergy. Afferent input is known to be a powerful driver of cortical reorganisation. In particular, the timing and pattern of afferent input is thought to be crucial to the induction of plastic change. In healthy subjects, I examined the neurophysiological effects of applying &#8220;associative&#8221; (synchronous) and &#8220;non-associative&#8221; (asynchronous) patterns of afferent input to the motor points or digits of the hand. I observed an increase in the volume and area of the cortical representation of stimulated muscles when associative stimulation was applied over the motor points of two hand muscles. This pattern of stimulation also caused the centres of gravity of the stimulated muscles to move closer together, mimicking the maladaptive changes seen in focal hand dystonia. Non-associative stimulation and stimulation applied to the digits did not produce such an effect. Task-specific focal dystonia is characterised by excessive representational plasticity resulting in cortical representations which are significantly larger, and demonstrate greater overlap, than those seen in healthy individuals. These changes are thought to be driven, in part, by repetitive movement patterns which promote associative patterns of afferent input over an extended time period. On the basis of this knowledge, I applied non-associative stimulation to the hand muscles of dystonic subjects. Following this intervention, I noted a contraction of representational maps and a separation in the centres of gravity of the stimulated muscles. These neurophysiological changes were accompanied by improvements on a cyclic drawing task. This thesis demonstrates the functional correlates of neuroplasticity in M1, S1 and SMA during object manipulation using a precision grasp. These findings further extend our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying effective grasp control and assist us in the development of future rehabilitation protocols for neurological conditions involving grasp dysfunction. In addition, this thesis is the first to demonstrate an improvement in both neurophysiological and functional measures in focal dystonia following a period of non-associative afferent stimulation. These results open up exciting new avenues for the development of effective treatment protocols in those with focal hand dystonia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cortical plasticity; grip-lift task; primary motor cortex; focal hand dystonia; transcranial magnetic simulation; human</field><field name="subject">Neuroplasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Option pricing using path integrals.</field><field name="creator">Bonnet, Frederic D.R.</field><field name="description">It is well established that stock market volatility has a memory of the past, moreover it is found that volatility correlations are long ranged. As a consequence, volatility cannot be characterized by a single correlation time in general. Recent empirical work suggests that the volatility correlation functions of various assets actually decay as a power law. Moreover it is well established that the distribution functions for the returns do not obey a Gaussian distribution, but follow more the type of distributions that incorporate what are commonly known as fat&#8211;tailed distributions. As a result, if one is to model the evolution of the stock price, stock market or any financial derivative, then standard Brownian motion models are inaccurate. One must take into account the results obtained from empirical studies and work with models that include realistic features observed on the market. In this thesis we show that it is possible to derive the path integral for a non-Gaussian option pricing model that can capture fat&#8211;tails.

Environmental concerns, depleted energy resources and higher energy prices are the main factors that drive this interest. Energy efficiency is one of the main avenues to preserve and better utilize this valuable commodity. The energy exchange by employment of heat exchangers is extensive and tube-fin heat exchangers are widely used in industrial and commercial applications. Smarter designs could not only improve energy efficiency but may also save on material costs. Although mass production and improved manufacturing techniques have reduced manufacturing costs, tube fin heat exchangers have not evolved greatly to take advantage of these improvements. There has been a large range of fin surface enhancements proposed, such as waffled fins or louvres and while limited improvements in capacity have been achieved, this is generally accomplished at a much larger pressure drop penalty. Numerous studies have been performed in order to examine the potential of various surface enhancement geometries on an ad hoc basis. These presumably operate on the basis of enhanced convection due to increased turbulence levels. However very few of these studies examine the actual nature of turbulence that is responsible for convection enhancement. A series of experiments and numerical studies have been conducted to quantify the effect of the turbulence vortex characteristics on the air side heat convection of a tube-fin heat exchanger. Homogeneous, transverse and streamwise vortical structures were investigated. The thermal transfer performance resulting from these flows was compared to that of standard louver fin geometries by considering sensible heat transfer only, applicable to radiator applications. Several novel coils designed to achieve these vortex structures, were developed and their heat transfer characteristics were quantified. These coil designs can be described as the Tube Mesh, Tube Strut and a Delta-Winglet fin surface.The Tube Mesh heat exchanger consisted entirely of horizontal and vertical tubes arranged in an approximate homogeneous turbulence generating grid. While they had a lower heat transfer of between 53% to 63% of that of the louvre fin surface, they had an extremely low pressure drop of 25% to 33%. This has the potential to make them suitable for certain low pressure drop applications, especially if energy saving is a prerequisite. The range of Tube Strut coils consisted of a tube bundle with interconnecting heat conducting struts to form a parallel plate array were also investigated. Three different strut thicknesses and strut spacing were trialled. In general these had similar performance to the tube mesh at 45% to 65% the heat transfer capacity of the louver fin surface. The resulting pressure drop was 38% to 42% of that of the louver fin surface. A delta-winglet design which positioned the deltas in a flow up configuration just in front of the tubes was examined. It was found that this configuration had an almost comparable capacity of 87% to a louver surface having the same fin pitch. On the other hand it had approximately half the pressure drop of 54% of the similar louver fin surface. This particularly low pressure drop makes this design preferable from an energy utilisation perspective. While a slight increase in coil area is required, this is offset by an almost 50% reduction in operating costs by reducing the parasitic energy requirements of the convection fans. The experimental data gathered for this Delta-Winglet design served to validate a succession of numerical simulations which were performed to estimate the performance of other configurations of multiple vortex generators. In addition the performance of combining a delta-wing with a louvred surface was investigated. It was found that increasing the number of delta-winglets or combining deltas with a louvred surface provided little improvement in heat transfer but increased pressure drop substantially. The louvre design itself was examined, and simulations were undertaken to estimate the effect of louvre angle, as well as louvre pitch. A hitherto unexamined concept was to investigate the effect of having louvres with serrated edges. It was found that an increase in louver angle by 5 degrees had negligible effect on heat transfer but increased the pressure drop by 17%. A variation in louver pitch showed a minimal variation in both heat transfer and pressure drop. Surprisingly a serrated louver showed a slight reduction in both heat transfer and pressure drop but this was miniscule. It was established throughout the course of the investigations that the bulk of the coil heat transfer is performed by the first tube row. Therefore the potential for increasing heat transfer by shifting some heat exchange to the down stream rows was examined. This was attempted by having progressively increasing louvre angles from the front of the coil to the rear. While a slight increase in heat transfer performance was achieved, this accomplished at the expense of a 13%-14% increase in pressure drop. The outcomes have shown that substantial net improvement of heat exchanger energy efficiency can be achieved through optimization of the turbulence generation along the fins of a tube fin heat exchanger.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers.</field><field name="subject">Turbulence.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59079</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of gastric motility in health and diabetes.</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Julie Eva</field><field name="description">The human stomach is a complex organ with sophisticated function. &#8211; The control of delivery of nutrients to the small intestine is tightly regulated, and the patterns and determinants of the associated processes are numerous, complex and interrelated. The presence of nutrients in the small intestine stimulates the release of a number of gastrointestinal hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Exogenous GLP-1 reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and this is thought to be via a slowing of gastric emptying (GE). The effects of endogenous GLP-1 on GE and glycaemia were evaluated using exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 antagonist, in healthy subjects, in a randomised, placebo-controlled study, in Chapter 5. Exendin(9-39) increased postprandial glycaemia through an acceleration of GE; these findings support the putative role of GLP-1 as an enterogastrone. The capacity to measure GE has greatly increased the understanding of normal and disordered gastric physiology. 30 &#8211; 50 % of patients with longstanding diabetes have delayed GE. Scintigraphy remains the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; in the measurement of GE, however, it is associated with a radiation burden. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography was validated against scintigraphy in healthy subjects. In Chapter 6, GE was measured concurrently by 3D ultrasonography and scintigraphy in patients with diabetic gastroparesis, and good correlation and agreement was found between both techniques. Glycaemic control represents one of the main pathogenetic factors of diabetic gastroparesis. Hyperglycaemia slows, while hypoglycaemia accelerates, GE in healthy subjects and patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes. Chapter 7 reports a study investigating the effects of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia vs. euglycaemia on GE in longstanding type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycaemia accelerated GE of a mixed solid/liquid meal; the magnitude of this acceleration was greater when GE during euglycaemia was slower. In contrast to glucose, the effects of intravenous (iv) fructose (used widely in the diabetic diet) on GE are less well understood. The comparative effects of iv fructose, glucose and saline on GE and antropyloroduodenal motility in healthy males are reported in Chapter 8. Compared with saline, fructose infusion was associated with a slowing of GE and suppression of antral waves, the magnitude of which was comparable to glucose. Treatment for the management of gastroparesis is currently suboptimal and there is a need for novel prokinetic agents. Itopride has demonstrated prokinetic activity in dogs. The effects of itopride on GE, glycaemia and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were studied in patients with longstanding diabetes in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial (Chapter 9). There was a trend for itopride to accelerate both solid and liquid GE. 48 % of patients had delayed solid and/or liquid GE on placebo, and in this group, itopride accelerated liquid, but not solid, GE. Autonomic neuropathy represents another pathogenetic factor of diabetic gastroparesis, and delayed GE is more prevalent in patients with autonomic dysfunction. There is evidence that C-peptide improves autonomic nerve function (ANF) in type 1 diabetes. The effects of C-peptide on GE and ANF were studied in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes in randomised, placebo-controlled design, in Chapter 10. C-peptide had no effect on solid or liquid GE, or ANF. Gastroparesis, particularly in patients with diabetes, represents an important clinical problem. The studies presented in this thesis have provided fundamental insights into the measurement and determinants of gastric motor function and postprandial glycaemia, and treatment of gastroparesis, however, further studies which assess the complex pathogenesis and pathophysiology of gastroparesis, and which include a larger cohort of patients, are warranted.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastric emptying; motility; scintigraphy; diabetes; glycaemia</field><field name="subject">Stomach Motility</field><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images and impacts of parenthood: explaining fertility and family size in contemporary Australia.</field><field name="creator">Newman, Lareen A.</field><field name="description">This thesis was written against the backdrop of Australia&#8217;s low fertility rate to investigate perceptions at the individual level, and within the social context, of influences on fertility and family size. The thesis aligns itself with cultural, ideational and institutional theories of fertility change. It seeks to augment contemporary debate and policy, which centre around work-family compatibility and the financial costs of children, by also investigating the influence of individuals&#8217; expectations and experiences of conception, pregnancy, birth and early parenthood. For several decades the geographical, medical and sociological literature has shown these reproductive events to heavily impact on the physical and mental well-being of parents in developed societies, but it is only recently that some demographers have suggested that they warrant renewed investigation in low fertility research. These aspects are all the more salient as postmodern values associated with concern about personal well-being have risen to prominence and have become associated with the transition to below replacement fertility. The primary research in the thesis comprises 62 in-depth interviews with parents from across metropolitan South Australia, and a small survey of 45 individuals intending to start a family within two years. The thesis intentionally includes the views of men and of parents with larger families. Analysis of 1996 Census data establishes fertility patterns at the macro level as a basis for exploring the qualitative data. The thesis findings contribute new knowledge by showing that in South Australia cultural and family influences shape images of family life and family size despite the rhetoric of modern reproductive &#8220;choice&#8221;. They also demonstrate how lower fertility can result from individuals with postmodern preferences finding their experiences of parenthood clashing with their preferences for autonomy, rationality, personal achievement and quality of life. The thesis argues that such experiences can diffuse socially to negatively influence the images and anticipated impacts of parenthood, and hence the fertility desires, of others. In identifying gender differences in the impacts, the thesis concludes that low fertility theory and policy must diversify to better reflect the concerns of women as mothers, and to consider the embodied and social aspects of reproductive behaviour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59535</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolomic analysis of the interleukin-10-deficient mouse model of Crohn's disease</field><field name="creator">Lin, Hui-Ming</field><field name="description">Crohn&#8217;s disease is an inflammatory disorder of the bowel, arising from the dysregulation of intestinal mucosal immunity. The interleukin-10-deficient (IL10-/-) mouse develops intestinal inflammation with similar characteristics to Crohn&#8217;s disease, due to the loss of immune tolerance towards intestinal microbiota. Metabolomic analysis is the study of small molecule metabolites, involving the measurement of large numbers of metabolites in biological samples. The aim of the research was to study the urinary metabolite profile of IL10-/- mice by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic analysis. A metabolite profile of intestinal inflammation, consisting of 15 metabolites, was discovered by comparing the urinary metabolite profiles of IL10-/- and wildtype C57BL/6 mice. Xanthurenic acid and fucose were identified as the main urinary metabolites associated with the early stage of intestinal inflammation. Their levels were increased in IL10-/- mice relative to wildtype. Xanthurenic acid levels were attributed to increased tryptophan catabolism which produces kynurenine metabolites that may induce immune tolerance of T-cells towards intestinal microbiota. Plasma levels of kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine were confirmed to be elevated in IL10-/- mice. The increased fucose levels may be due to abnormal fucosylation of plasma or intestinal mucosal proteins involved in leukocyte trafficking. Comparisons of the urinary metabolite profiles of IL10-/- and wildtype mice also revealed eleven metabolite differences that were unaffected by inflammation severity in IL10-/- mice. The main metabolites were glutaric acid, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid and 2-hydroxyadipic acid, which were decreased in IL10-/- mice. These eleven metabolite differences may be associated with residual genes from embryonic stem cells of the 129P2 mouse strain used to create the IL10-/- mouse, or novel functions of IL10 that are unrelated to inflammation. The metabolite profile of inflammation was not altered in IL10-/- mice fed with kiwifruit extracts, consistent with other measures of inflammation which showed that intestinal inflammation was not attenuated by the dietary intervention. The urinary levels of some kiwifruit metabolites differed between IL10-/- and wildtype mice, suggesting differences in absorption or intestinal microbial metabolism of these metabolites. Overall, the research demonstrates that metabolomic analysis of IL10-/- mice can identify potential biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and provide new insights into the metabolic effects of IL10-deficiency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5793</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of endurance exercise on energy and protein balance</field><field name="creator">Rolleston, Anna K.</field><field name="description">Background  The energy cost of endurance exercise is significant and the ability to consume enough food to maintain energy balance is critical for success. In addition maintenance of body protein stores is also critical and there is a well known relationship between energy and protein balance. The establishment of any relationship between energy and protein balance and markers of overtraining in endurance athletes is also beneficial for endurance performance.  Purpose and Aims  The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effects of endurance exercise on energy balance and protein balance. The aims were to establish accurate values for EI, EE and protein balance in two endurance sports, Road Cycling and Ironman. The rationale was to determine whether endurance athletes are able to maintain energy and protein balance over periods of increased EE and whether parameters of energy and protein balance related to markers of overtraining  Methods  Two research projects were conducted, the first at the Tour of Southland cycle event (5 high performance male cyclists) and the second at an Ironman training camp (7 male Ironman athletes). In both studies EE was determined by the DLW technique and EI by supervised weighed diet records. Protein balance was determined by an 18-hour primed continuous infusion of 13C-leucine at the Tour of Southland and via the traditional 24-hour nitrogen balance technique at the Ironman camp. Both techniques were performed prior to and immediately after the given event. Nude body weight, blood overtraining parameters, urine samples and a mood questionnaire were collected in the mornings for analysis of daily parameters.  Results  The Tour of Southland: Subjects maintained energy balance with a mean EI of 27.3&#177;3.8 MJ/day and a mean EE of 27.4 &#177; 2.0 MJ/day. There was no significant change in protein breakdown or parameters of overtraining. Ironman Training Camp: Athletes maintained energy balance with a mean EI of 20.27&#177;2.91 MJ/day and a mean EE of 20.5&#177;3.4 MJ/day and nitrogen balance was positive. There were indications of a relationship between energy and protein balance and markers of overtraining in both studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5811</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling inter-ethnic partnerships in New Zealand 1981-2006: a census-based approach</field><field name="creator">Walker, Lyndon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the patterns of ethnic partnership in New Zealand using national census data from 1981 to 2006. Inter-ethnic partnerships are of interest as they demonstrate the existence of interaction across ethnic boundaries, and are an indication of social boundaries between ethnic groups. A follow-on effect of inter-ethnic marriage is that children of mixed ethnicity couples are less likely to define themselves within a single ethnic group, further reducing cultural distinctions between the groups. The main goals of the research are to examine the historical patterns of ethnic partnership, and then use simulation models to examine the partnership matching process. It advances the current research on ethnic partnering in New Zealand through its innovative methodology and its content. Previous studies of New Zealand have examined at most two time periods, whereas this study uses six full sets of census data from a twenty-five year period. There are two key components to the methodological innovation in this study. The first is the use of log-linear models to examine the patterns in the partnership tables, which had previously only been analysed using proportions. The second is the use of the parallel processing capability of a cluster computing resource to run an evolutionary algorithm which simulated the partnership matching process using unit-level census data of the single people in the Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury regions. The European group showed a much lower rate of same ethnicity partnering than that suggested by the proportion of homogamous couples. European individuals and Maori individuals showed similar rates of same ethnicity partnering, with little change over time. The Pacific group was the only one to see an increasing tendency for same-ethnicity partnerships, whilst the rate for Asian people decreased dramatically. Individuals with dual ethnic affiliations were more likely to have a partial match of ethnicity than none at all, and there was evidence of gender asymmetry amongst some ethnic combinations. The evolutionary algorithm showed that age and education similarities were the dominant matching factors for recreating ethnic patterns. The rate of same-ethnicity and mixed-ethnicity partnerships also contributed to the matching algorithm, providing some evidence of a micro-macro link.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5823</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and theoretical studies into the laser pyrolytic formation of chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fullerene precursors.</field><field name="creator">McIntosh, Grant Jason</field><field name="description">Fullerenic materials are likely to play an important role in technologies of the future. To ensure that production techniques will be able to keep up with demand, a thorough understanding of their mechanism of formation, which has thus far proved elusive, is required. Hydrocarbon pyrolysis is a potentially viable fullerene production technique, and the pyrolysis of chlorohydrocarbons has also shown promise. However, decomposition of the latter produces toxic and environmentally hazardous chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also formed in industrial waste incinerators, as a byproduct. Close study of the high temperature chemistry of chlorohydrocarbons may aid both the mitigation of hazardous byproducts and implementation of more effective fullerene synthesis techniques. To this end, we have studied the formation mechanisms of dichloromethane degradation products generated via Infrared Laser Powered Homogeneous Pyrolysis. This unique technique is well known for having a non-uniform temperature profile, which has a number of attractive features for this work. The most important of these are the absence of complicating surface catalysed reactions, and the potential for allowing annealing reactions necessary for fullerene growth. Time resolved product yields are monitored via GC-MS and FTIR, and mechanistic deductions are supported heavily by Density Functional Theory calculations and kinetic arguments. Results indicate that the initial growth of chlorinated compounds deviate significantly from the radical-based growth found with hydrocarbons. Facile Cl-loss in important radicals and stabilisation of carbenes by chlorine permits novel C4 and C6 production channels. Conventional channels involving acetylene addition to aromatic radicals are eventually restored in C8--C12 formation, although we do suggest some amendments to the mechanism. Bimolecular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon addition reactions may also play an important role. Acenaphthylene (C12H8) congeners also allow for the first studies of the migration of five-membered rings about chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks, a vital process in fullerene annealing; it is found that the presence of chlorine significantly stabilises transition states, suggesting these reactions are much more facile in heavily chlorinated systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5829</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori issues for remediation of bio-hazards, chemo-hizards and natural disasters : a thesis completed in part satisfaction of a Masters in Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Webber, Chris</field><field name="description">This study sets out: 1.

Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and properties of fully conjugated porphyrin arrays for light harvesting : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lodato, Fabio</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the synthesis of porphyrin arrays for light-harvesting applications using Wittig chemistry, which allows the construction of covalently bound systems that are conjugated, stable and easy to characterize. This was achieved using a dendrimer strategy utilizing tetraarylporphyrins as building blocks, monofunctionalized with either aldehyde or phosphonium salt groups at the &#946;-pyrrolic position, and benzenes, polyfunctionalized with either aldehyde or phosphonium salt groups; stepwise control of the addition of each porphyrin moiety was thus obtained. In this way, different porphyrins in different metallated states were arranged in a determinate geometrical relationship, which is of great importance in the investigations on electron/energy transfers. Arrays containing up to five metalloporphyrin units (two kinds of porphyrins coordinating two different metals) were synthesized and characterized. The unexpected chromatography behaviour and 1H-NMR spectra of a Zn porphyrin functionalized with a 1,3-bis(methyl(diethylphosphonate) benzene were the reason for an investigation, which uncovered, mainly with the use of NMR spectrometry, the first case of intramolecular coordination between the Zn centre and a phosphonate group of the same porphyrin. The dynamic nature of this coordination was characterized and chemical-physical parameters for Zn porphyrin/phosphonate binding were determined. In order to establish the photophysical properties of our conjugated arrays, we synthesized a series of dyads containing Zn and free-base tetraphenylporphyrins (TPPs) connected through variable length phenylenevinylene-type bridges; along with this series, the preparation of the Zn and free-base homometallic homologue dyads and two series of monomers carrying the conjugated linker were realized. Collaboration with IFOS-CNR in Bologna, Italy was established in order to investigate the intramolecular photophysics of those systems, which involve efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the Zn to the free-base porphyrin. Finally, dyads composed of Fe(III) and Zn porphyrin were prepared as part of a project in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania for the investigation of new artificial photosynthetic systems. Two series of dimers were prepared in order to obtain incorporation in both the classes of hydrophobic and hydrophilic proteins. TPPs were used for the making of the hydrophobic dyads while hydrophilicity was achieved by employing tetraester porphyrin derivatives, which can be quantitatively hydrolyzed to afford the correspondent water soluble acids. A new monosubstituted porphyrin was also synthesized and incorporated in the arrays to minimize steric hindrance inside the protein binding sites.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photophysics</field><field name="subject">Electron/energy transfers</field><field name="subject">Wittig reaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

Twelve species (E. agglomerata, E. baxteri, E. botryoides, E. cladocalyx, E. globoidea, E. microcorys, E. muelleriana, E. nitens, E. obliqua, E. pilularis, E. regnans and E. saligna) were compared on four hill country microsites; upper and lower slope on sunny and shady aspects. Assessments included survival, foliar macro-nutrients, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, stem form, basic wood density and health to age 5 years. Site monitoring included solar radiation, temperature, rainfall and exposure. Foliar nutrients were strongly influenced by species and moderately influenced by microsite. Inter-nutrient and nutrient-growth correlations were identified and discussed. Subgeneric differences in nutrient profile were analysed with the aid of principal components analysis. Solar radiation and temperature were seasonal on both aspects but higher on the sunny face than the shady. Aspect differences were moderate, being greatest in the winter and least in the summer. A strongly seasonal growth pattern resulted, maximum DBH and height increments occurring in the spring and summer respectively. Growth was least in the winter. Seasonal and aspect effects on growth were related to solar radiation. Height and DBH (5 years) were significantly higher on the sunny face than the shady in all species. Slope position did not influence height but DBH on the lower slope was less than on the upper. Aspect had little influence on basic wood density and form. Species differed in growth, form and basic density. E. nitens was the most productive species but basic density was low. Conversely, density was highest in E. cladocalyx, among the least productive species. The stringybarks were intermediate in growth, form and density. The relationships between growth, form, density and environmental factors were explored with canonical correlation. Two species (E. botryoides and E. saligna) were adversely affected by possum browsing and infection by a leaf gall wasp (Ophelimus eucalypti). Discussion of the results includes consideration of the merits of assessments of relatively young trees as well as implications for tree growers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus tree growth</field><field name="subject">Eucalypts, New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1482</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of inhibitors in mitigating nitrogen losses from cattle urine and nitrogen fertiliser inputs in pastures : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Singh, Jagrati</field><field name="description">The major land use in New Zealand is pastoral farming of sheep and cattle. In intensively grazed dairy-pasture systems, animals graze on nitrogen (N)-rich legume-based pastures, but do not efficiently utilize the N they ingest. On average only 10.5% of the N in forage-based animal feed is converted into milk and the remainder is excreted in dung and urine. In the pastures, a cow urine patch can typically contain up to 1000 kg N ha-1. Nitrogen input, either in the form of cow urine or fertilizer, often exceeds immediate plant requirements and hence is susceptible to losses as ammonia (NH3) volatilisation and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and removal in drainage water through nitrate (NO3-) leaching. This loss of N from grazed pastures causes detrimental environmental impacts in the form of acidification and eutrophication of the soil and water bodies, global warming, destruction of stratospheric ozone, and NO3- toxicity. Various approaches have been attempted to mitigate the economic and environmental impacts of N losses. One such approach is the use of Urease (UIs) and Nitrification (NIs) inhibitors. There have been extensive studies on the value of UIs in arable farming and NIs in grazed pastures. However, only limited work on the impact of UI and NI alone and in combination in influencing the N dynamics, and thus mitigating N gaseous losses from pastures, has been conducted. This thesis examines the impact of UI (Agrotain; N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide) and NI (Dicyandiamide, commonly known as DCD), when applied alone or in combination to cow urine and urea fertiliser, on N losses through NH3 and N2O emissions and NO3- leaching, and on herbage production under glasshouse conditions and a field-plot study. The degradation rate of DCD, and its effect on nitrification and on N2O emissions from four soils varying in their physical and chemical properties was also examined under laboratory incubations. The results from the field-plot study were then used to predict the effect of DCD on N2O emissions reductions from urine by adapting the process-based NZ-DNDC model. Both NH3 and N2O emissions have common sources in agriculture. Therefore, chambers were adapted to measure their emissions simultaneously using active and passive gas sampling. Active sampling involved continuous air flow and the use of acid (0.05 M H2SO4 and 2% H3BO3) traps for NH3 measurements and passive sampling involved collecting three gas samples over a one-hour period from a static chamber used for N2O emissions. The first glasshouse experiment used UI with urine or urea to assess its effect on NH3 and N2O emissions, changes in soil mineral-N and N uptake by pasture plants. The UI treatments also involved two commercial products, Sustain Yellow (urea coated with Agrotain and elemental S) and Sustain Green (urea coated with Agrotain). The use of UI effectively decreased total NH3 emissions, as well as delaying the time of maximum NH3 emissions from both urea (600 kg N ha-1) and urine (476 kg N ha-1) by 27% and 22%, respectively. The UI-induced decrease in NH3 volatilization ranged from 42-48% when urea was applied @ 100 kg N ha-1. Urease inhibitor was also effective in decreasing N2O emissions significantly from urine and urea applied @ 100 kg N ha-1. The addition of UI increased dry matter yield by 13-19% as compared to the urea-alone treatment. In the second glasshouse study, NI (DCD) was added @ 25 kg ha-1 to urea (@ 25, 50 and 75 kg N ha-1) and urine (@ 144, 290 and 570 kg N ha-1) applied at different rates. Addition of DCD reduced N2O emissions from both urea and urine and NO3- leaching from urine. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O emissions by 34-93% from the added urea and 33-80% from the added urine. However, its use increased the amount of ammonium (NH4+) present in the soil by 3 to 13% both in the urea and urine treatments, and this NH4+ was susceptible to leaching and volatilisation losses. The addition of DCD, however, resulted in a 60-65% reduction in NO3- leaching from urine applied to pasture soil cores. It also caused a significant reduction in NO3- -induced cation leaching. Leaching of K+, Mg+2 and Ca+2 ions was reduced by 36-42%, 33-50% and 72%, respectively, with DCD applied to cattle urine (290 and 570 kg N ha-1). The combined use of UI and NI was more effective in controlling N gaseous losses than using them individually. The combination of UI and NI retarded NH3 emissions by 70% in the urea treatment and by 4% in the urine treatment (field-plot study). It also considerably reduced N2O emissions (50-51%) following the application of urea and urine (field-plot study) to pasture soil. With the combined inhibitors, there was a 14 and 38% increase in herbage yield from added urea and urine (field-plot study), respectively. A laboratory incubation experiment was undertaken to study the effect of soil types and the rate of DCD application on the degradation kinetics of DCD. The rate of degradation of DCD varied among the four soils studied. The degradation was slowest (half-life period of 6 to 11 days) in an allophanic soil with a high concentration of organic matter. The effectiveness of DCD in inhibiting nitrification also varied depending on the nature and amount of soil organic matter and clay content. The maximum inhibition was observed in a soil with low organic matter and high clay content. Finally, 'NZ-DNDC', a process-based model, was adapted and used to simulate the effect of DCD on emissions reduction using DCD inhibition values that vary according to different soil types. This model effectively simulated the effect of DCD on N2O emissions reductions in Tokomaru silt loam following urine application. However, more field data are required from a range of pasture soils with contrasting amount of soil organic matter and clay content under differing climatic conditions to further test this model modification to predict emission-reductions with DCD application in different soil types.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitirification inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Urease inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Nitrate leaching</field><field name="subject">Gas emissions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1483</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and physiological responses of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) to the presence of humans and dogs :|ba thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beausoleil, Ngaio Jessica</field><field name="description">Appendices removed due to copyright restrictions  Appendix 1: Beausoleil, N J, Stafford, KJ, Mellor, DJ. 2005.

However, the genetic basis for parasitism remains unknown. Parastrongyloides trichosuri is a facultative parasitic nematode of the Australian brushtail possum. This parasite has retained the unusual ability to sample its environment at each generation, and make the developmental decision to develop either into a free-living nematode or, in response to environmental stress, develop into an infective larva, which must then seek out a host in order to complete its life cycle. The nematode model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, also responds to environmental stresses by developing into a dauer larvae. The dauer hypothesis proposes that dauer larvae and infective larvae are homologous and that dauer larvae may be an evolutionary pre-adaptation that facilitated the evolution of parasitism in nematodes. One of the signalling pathways which control dauer larva development in C. elegans is the Insulin/IGF signalling pathway. Gene orthologues of the insulin/IGF signalling pathway were cloned from P. trichosuri: the daf-2 tyrosine kinase receptor, the age-1 phosphatidylinositol 3&#8242; kinase and the daf-16 FOXO forkhead transcription factor. The expression profiles of these genes were characterized by q-PCR which determined that they were differentially expressed during the developmental switch to infective larva. Rescue by complementation showed that a P. trichosuri daf-16 transgene was able to recover both stress and developmental phenotypes in C. elegans daf mutants, suggesting it might perform an orthologous role in P. trichosuri. This research also demonstrated that the biology of P. trichosuri infective larvae and C. elegans dauer larvae are quite similar. Some of the environmental signals which control the free-living/infective larva developmental switch in P. trichosuri were characterized in this study and found to be similar to the environmental signals which trigger dauer larval development. These are: population density, food availability and temperature. There is a genetic component to the ability to respond to the environmental signals and inbred lines which display diverse developmental plasticity were isolated.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parastrongyloides trichosuri</field><field name="subject">Australian brushtail possum</field><field name="subject">Insulin/IGF signalling pathway</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1485</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical models for earthquakes incorporating ancillary data : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Statistics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ting</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two parts. The first part proposes a new model &#8211; the Markov-modulated Hawkes process with stepwise decay (MMHPSD) to investigate the seismicity rate. The MMHPSD is a self-exciting process which switches among different states, in each of which the process has distinguishable background seismicity and decay rates. Parameter estimation is developed via the expectation maximization algorithm. The model is applied to data from the Landers earthquake sequence, demonstrating that it is useful for modelling changes in the temporal patterns of seismicity. The states in the model can capture the behavior of main shocks, large aftershocks, secondary aftershocks and a period of quiescence with different background rates and decay rates. The state transitions can then explain the seismicity rate changes and help indicate if there is any seismicity shadow or relative quiescence. The second part of this thesis develops statistical methods to examine earthquake sequences possessing ancillary data, in this case groundwater level data or GPS measurements of deformation. For the former, signals from groundwater level data at Tangshan Well, China, are extracted for the period from 2002 to 2005 using a moving window method. A number of different statistical techniques are used to detect and quantify coseismic responses to P, S, Love and Rayleigh wave arrivals. The P phase arrivals appear to trigger identifiable oscillations in groundwater level, whereas the Rayleigh waves amplify the water level movement. Identifiable coseismic responses are found for approximately 40 percent of magnitude 6+ earthquakes worldwide. A threshold in the relationship between earthquake magnitude and well&#8211;epicenter distance is also found, satisfied by 97% of the identified coseismic responses, above which coseismic changes in groundwater level at Tangshan Well are most likely. A non-linear filter measuring short-term deformation rate changes is introduced to extract signals from GPS data. For two case studies of a) deep earthquakes in central North Island, New Zealand, and b) shallow earthquakes in Southern California, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is fitted to the output from the filter. Mutual information analysis indicates that the state having the largest variation of deformation rate contains precursory information that indicates an elevated probability for earthquake occurrence.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistical modelling</field><field name="subject">Earthquakes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230204 Applied statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1486</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological studies of Avian influenza viruses in Hong Kong : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kung, Nina Yu-Hsin</field><field name="description">Eight studies of the epidemiological dynamics of avian influenza viruses were conducted on poultry in Hong Kong, with special focus on the movement of birds through the live poultry marketing system, and the implications for avian influenza transmission. The first involved analysis of virus isolation data from faecal samples obtained from cooperating stalls in live poultry markets in Hong Kong in a routine sampling program undertaken between 1999 and 2001. This showed that two subtypes of avian influenza viruses, H9N2 and H6N1, have become well established in the Hong Kong live poultry markets, especially in chickens (mainly H9N2) and quail (mainly H6N1). In addition, a wave of H5N1 virus infection occurred in 2001 after it had been absent through the earlier period of the study. The second study was an evaluation of long term changes in the marketing systems for live poultry in Hong Kong, their likely effects on avian influenza epidemiology, and documented evidence of the prevalence of various H subtypes of avian influenza in sampling undertaken during three periods from 1975 to 2001. The third project involved two cross-sectional studies and one longitudinal study on local quail farms in Hong Kong. Results showed that quail could act as a reservoir host for H9N2 and H6N1 subtype viruses, but each subtype differed in its epidemiology. H9 virus usually infected quail at around 10 days of age, whereas H6 infected quail at 15-20 days of age. At 35 days of age (usual market age in Hong Kong), a proportion of market quail were likely to be susceptible to H6 (50%) and H9 viruses (20%), and were able to transmit the virus in the markets. Due to these findings, the Hong Kong Government closed the quail farming operations and restricted the sale of quail in live poultry markets. A longitudinal study was conducted on three live poultry market stalls to assess the time from stall entry to sale, and evaluate the influence of this delay on avian influenza virus transmission to other poultry in the same stall. Participating stalls varied from high volume/rapid turnover to low volume/slow turnover. Turnover for tagged poultry was rapid, although some chickens became infected with H9 virus before sale. Birds which stayed longer, such as quail, became infected and maintained infection in the stall. As well as spread by direct contact and on typical fomites, keeping of pet roosters and re-use of washing water were identified as factors increasing the ability of avian influenza strains to persist in market stalls. An experimental replica of a market stall was created to study the transmission of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (H9N2) in a controlled environment, with different rates of population turnover and different immune status with respect to both H5 and H9 subtypes. Transmission was influenced by distance between birds, the proportion of birds carrying antibody to H9 and the rate of introduction of susceptible birds, but not by the use of H5N2 vaccine. In order to assess the effectiveness of temporary depopulation of stalls, a study was conducted to compare the prevalence of avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus before and shortly after the monthly rest day in live poultry markets in Hong Kong, by virus isolation. Prevalence of H9N2 avian influenza virus was reduced by the rest day, but Newcastle disease virus prevalence was unaffected. During the 2002 avian influenza H5N1 outbreak in local chicken farms, a case-control study was undertaken to identify risk factors that may have contributed to this outbreak. A questionnaire was administered by interview to collect the data for this study. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that movement of people and fomites from live poultry markets to farms were important influences on transmission, and that the live bird markets were the likely source of virus for farms. A spatial stochastic computer model was constructed to predict the spread of avian influenza virus in local chicken farms and live poultry markets in Hong Kong, and the effectiveness of control measures. The data used in model parameter setting was derived from the case-control study. The reference model produced an epidemic curve which was similar to the true epidemic curve in the 2002 outbreak. Control strategies such as rest day and vaccination were evaluated within the model, and found to produce results comparable with field experience. Results from these studies clarify various aspects of the epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of avian influenza viruses, and provide guidance on appropriate control and prevention strategies for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses within poultry marketing systems in Asia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bird flu</field><field name="subject">Poultry diseases</field><field name="subject">Disease transmission</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1487</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishment and silvopastoral aspects of willow and poplar : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.

Five experiments were conducted at the Pasture and Crop Research Unit, Massey University Palmerston North, NZ to examine the ability of willow and poplar to establish as a willow/poplar pasture system in NZ over a period of 3 years from December 2002 to April 2005. With an objective to select the best size for low cost planting, stem diameters (10 mm, 25 mm and 35 mm) were planted vertically and stem lengths (50 mm, 200 mm and 600 mm) were planted horizontally to determine their growth, establishment, biomass production and regrowth after browsing. From December 2002 to March 2003, three management treatments, mowing, herbicide and control (no weed control) treatments, were designed and applied to determine their effects on growth and shoot biomass production. From September 2004 to April 2005, mowing was replaced by sheep browsing and the effect of browsing, herbicide and control treatments on soil and tree water status (soil water content, soil water loss and deficit, and stem water potential) were examined. Longer (600 mm) and thicker stem diameters (35 mm) produced the greatest shoot biomass (edible biomass, total biomass and root biomass) compared to the thin stem cuttings (50 mm length and 10 mm diameter). Higher tree survival was also found for longer (600 mm) and thicker stems diameter (35 mm). The mown treatment produced significantly more edible and total shoot dry matter (DM) than the herbicide and control treatments, with willow clone 'Kinuyanagi' producing higher total shoot DM than 'Tangoio'. Pasture management had no significant effect on soil water content during spring 2004 and late summer/autumn 2005, however, it was significant during early and mid summer. Strong relationships between (i) soil water content and stem water potential (SWP), and (ii) SWP and soil water deficit were found and could help growers to predict the amount of water required during the growing season. The results clearly demonstrated that sheep grazing had negligible damaging effect on willow and poplar (main stem, branch breakage and tree leaning) and tree mortality, and that young trees can be browsed during pasture shortages in summer drought. Cutting size and understorey control for establishing willow and poplar into pasture have been better defined by this research. It is recommended that farmers establishing willow and poplar for fodder plant thick (vertical planting) and long stems (horizontal planting) for higher growth and biomass production.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Willow growth</field><field name="subject">Poplar growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1488</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of Penicillium paxilli genes required for biosynthesis of paxilline : this thesis is presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Saikia, Sanjay</field><field name="description">Paxilline belongs to a large, structurally and functionally diverse group of indole-diterpenes and is synthesised by the filamentous fungus Penicillium paxilli. A gene cluster for paxilline biosynthesis in P. paxilli has been identified and characterised. However, none of the steps proposed in the biosynthesis of paxilline or paxilline-like indole-diterpenes have been validated. In some diterpene-producing filamentous fungi, including P. paxilli, two distinct copies of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase, that catalyses the committed step in diterpene biosynthesis, have been identified. However, the biological significance of the presence of two distinct GGPP synthases is not known. In this study, biochemical analysis of the paxilline gene products in P. paxilli and subcellular localisation of the two P. paxilli GGPP synthases, Ggs1 and PaxG, were carried out. Transfer of constructs containing different combinations of pax genes into a pax cluster negative deletion derivative of P. paxilli identified four Pax proteins that are required for the biosynthesis of a paxilline intermediate, paspaline. These proteins are PaxG, a GGPP synthase, PaxM, a FAD-dependent monooxygenase, PaxB, a putative membrane protein, and PaxC, a prenyltransferase. Using precursor feeding experiments, it was confirmed that the indole-diterpenes paspaline and &#946;-PC-M6 are substrates for the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, PaxP, and are converted to 13-desoxypaxilline. Further, it was confirmed that the indole-diterpene 13-desoxypaxilline is a substrate for PaxQ, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, and is converted to paxilline. Unlike PaxQ, PaxP is specific for indole-diterpene substrates that have a &#946;-stereochemistry. The detection of the indole-diterpene products was related to the expression of the transgene in the pax cluster negative background.

In this study, the extent of informal credit programmes in rural areas is identified and an assessment is made of how important these schemes are to rural people, especially small farmers, from economic, social and cultural points of view. The influence of local culture and values on informal rural credit systems is also examined. Fieldwork was conducted in three villages of Solok district, West Sumatra, Indonesia. This study reveals that credit programmes, whether from the formal or informal sectors, have not had a positive impact on poverty alleviation. The majority of formal credit programmes in the three case study villages failed to give service to the rural poor, especially small farmers. It is likely that the reason for the failure was the unmet demand between the formal financial institutions as the credit providers and the small farmers as the credit recipients. The informal credit programmes were also unsuccessful in helping the poor to increase their income because the loans were small in size and were mainly used for fulfilling basic and emergency needs. Credit from informal sources is used for survival rather than for development. However, informal credit schemes were favoured by the majority of the rural population due to their flexibility and adaptation to local cultures and values. This study finds that informal credit schemes in these three case study villages have potential to empower local people and to strengthen traditional rural credit systems in the era of decentralisation. Arisan Suku, Julo-julo and 'friendly moneylenders' are examples of these informal credit schemes, and they figured significantly in the credit and savings activities of the poor in the study area. Therefore, this study rejects the conventional assumptions that informal finance is exploitative, insignificant and unorganised. The positive impact of local culture and values on the informal credit systems in the study area mainly focuses on the influence of local culture of Minangkabau and the value of Islamic religion in shaping rural informal credit systems. In this case Minangkabau people have been practicing credit and savings activities for a long time, and this reinforces the informal credit system in the area. Regarding the influence of Islamic values, this is in line with the current growing attention paid to the Islamic finance system, both at national and international levels. The positive impacts of local culture and values are important for developing a more participatory rural financial system. This study recommends that the future rural financial systems can be developed by combining positive features of both formal and informal credit systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural poverty</field><field name="subject">Small farmers</field><field name="subject">Credit systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1490</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Islamic entrepreneurship : a case study of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kayed, Rasem N</field><field name="description">The point of departure in this study is that entrepreneurship, regardless of how it is defined, is more than a means to create employment opportunities and maximise economic returns; it is rather a development alternative with great potential to contribute to the well-being of individuals, communities and nations in developed, developing and less developed countries alike. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the entrepreneurship phenomenon from an Islamic perspective within the Saudi Arabia context. The thesis specifically seeks to examine the relationship between Islamic values and entrepreneurial activity and to establish whether these values can be more effectively tapped into to raise the profile of Islamic form of entrepreneurship and promote alternatives to development. The philosophical differences between the Islamic and the prevailing Western world-views on the theoretical as well as the practical aspects of development are fundamental, to the point where they cannot be marginalised or reconciled and integrated within a standardised single development model. Furthermore, the lack of cultural sensitivity on the part of the Western model and its inability to account for variables specific to the Islamic cultural and institutional environment justify the need to search for an alternative Islamic model of entrepreneurship that best serves the ultimate goal of the Muslim nation (ummah), that is, realising the state of well-being (falah). Despite the suggestion of modernisation theories of development and the prevalent conventional assumption that Islam is intrinsically anti-modernisation and anti-development, and that the religiously based Saudi culture would be the foremost obstacle in the way of cultivating a dynamic entrepreneurship class in Saudi Arabia, the findings of this study indicate otherwise. There is no evidence of incompatibility between Islamic values and entrepreneurship. Lack of entrepreneurial dynamism in Saudi Arabia by no means can be attributed to adherence to Islamic values and business ethics; rather, it can be linked to the state's failure to assimilate the implication of entrepreneurship and consequently to integrate Islamic values into its developmental process. This research indicates that Saudi entrepreneurs embrace positive perceptions and attitudes regarding the role of Islamic values in promoting productivity through entrepreneurship. This positive attitude is independent of both the demographic backgrounds of the entrepreneurs and the physical characteristics of their enterprises. Analysis of case studies of Saudi entrepreneurs revealed inconsistencies between the attitudes and practised behaviours of Saudi entrepreneurs, and the reality of the Saudi entrepreneurship landscape. The personal in-depth interviews with various stakeholders explained this divergence mainly in terms of entrepreneurship policy vacuity and incompatibility between Islamic values and the existing institutional framework, most evident in the financial sector. The findings of this study further confirm that Islamic entrepreneurship is a concept that is misread by the vast majority of Muslims at individual as well as at state levels. Arguably this misinterpretation has caused, and at the same time is largely caused by, the neglect of policymakers, lack of institutional support and deficiency in educational systems that lacked the focus on entrepreneurship development. The study therefore emphasises the need to rethink the current official approach to entrepreneurship, and highlights the importance of devising entrepreneurship policies that draw from local experiences and cultural values. Building a viable entrepreneurship sector also requires the intervention of the state, most likely through a combination of directive as well as facilitative policies. However, the exact form, scope and nature of government intervention should be mapped in line with the findings of future policy-oriented research. The main challenge for Islamic (development) remains operational in nature: how can the Islamic entrepreneurship model be transformed into working policies and enabling institutions? Furthermore, how can any Islamic business ethics be operationalised in the context of the contemporary business environment in order to reap the benefits of Islamic entrepreneurship? These basic questions bring about the inevitable question of whether or not the behaviour and the performance of Islamic entrepreneurship can be or should be judged in the absence of a true "Islamic state where the whole realm of socio-economic human behaviour is engineered according to Islam"1.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship, Saudi Arabia</field><field name="subject">Islamic values</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370404 Economic geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1491</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A calculation of colours: towards the automatic creation of graphical user interface colour schemes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moretti, Giovanni S.</field><field name="description">Interface colour scheme design is complex, but important. Most software allows users to choose the colours of single items individually and out of context, but does not acknowledge colour schemes or aid in their design. Creating colour schemes by picking individual colours can be time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating, and the results are often mediocre, especially for those without colour design skills. Further, as colour harmony arises from the interactions between all of the coloured elements, anticipating the overall eff ect of changing the colour of any single element can be difficult. This research explores the feasibility of extending artistic colour harmony models to include factors pertinent to user interface design. An extended colour harmony model is proposed and used as the basis for an objective function that can algorithmically assess the colour relationships in an interface colour scheme. Its assessments have been found to agree well with human evaluations and have been used as part of a process to automatically create harmonious and usable interface colour schemes. A three stage process for the design of interface colour schemes is described. In the fi rst stage, the designer speci es, in broad terms and without requiring colour design expertise, colouring constraints such as grouping and distinguishability that are needed to ensure that the colouring of interface elements reflects their semantics. The second stage is an optimisation process that chooses colour relationships to satisfy the competing requirements of harmonious colour usage, any designer-specified constraints, and readability. It produces sets of coordinates that constitute abstract colour schemes: they de fine only relationships between coloured items, not real colours. In the third and fi nal stage, a user interactively maps an abstract scheme to one or more real colour schemes. The colours can be fi ne-tuned as a set (but not altered individually), to allow for such "soft" factors as personal, contextual and cultural considerations, while preserving the integrity of the design embodied in the abstract scheme. The colours in the displayed interface are updated continuously, so users can interactively explore a large number of colour schemes, all of which have readable text, distinguishable controls, and conform to the principles of colour harmony. Experimental trials using a proof-of-concept implementation called the Colour Harmoniser have been used to evaluate a method of holistic colour adjustment and the resulting colour schemes. The results indicate that the holistic controls are easy to understand and eff ective, and that the automatically produced colour schemes, prior to fi ne-tuning, are comparable in quality to many manually created schemes, and after fi ne-tuning, are generally better. By designing schemes that incorporate colouring constraints specifi ed by the user prior to scheme creation, and enabling the user to interactively fi ne-tune the schemes after creation, there is no need to specify or incorporate the subtle and not well understood factors that determine whether any particular set of colours is "suitable". Instead, the approach used produces broadly harmonious schemes, and defers to the developer in the choice of the fi nal colours.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colour</field><field name="subject">Colour design</field><field name="subject">User interface design</field><field name="subject">GUI design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1492</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Standing in the shadow of the moon: a diaristic encounter with identity through my everyday</field><field name="creator">Tran, Michelle</field><field name="description">Art and lived experience are the key to my work.

One important aspect of story telling is the way characters are introduced and then moved through the story. Telling a story to a na&#239;ve listener places varied demands on a speaker. As the story plot develops, the speaker must set and re-set these parameters for referring to characters, as well as the temporal and spatial parameters of the story. To these cognitive and linguistic tasks is the added social and pragmatic task of monitoring the knowledge and attention states of their listener. The speaker must ensure that the listener can identify the characters, and so must anticipate their listener&#8217;s knowledge and on-going mental image of the story. How speakers do this depends on cultural conventions and on the resources of the language(s) they speak.

Premature sutural fusion, typically occurring in utero, results in anomalous skull growth, and may have consequences for the developing brain. Most cases of single-suture craniosynostosis (SSC) require surgery, preferentially performed within the first year of life, to release the fused suture and reshape the deformed skull and improve brain growth potential. The exact mechanisms by which brain development is disrupted in SSC are uncertain. Research suggests that children with all forms of SSC are at heightened risk for neuropsychological problems; however, the nature, extent and risk factors (e.g., genetic, environmental, severity of skull deformity) for these disturbances, are yet to be established. The aim of this study was to examine the impact that SSC may have on neurodevelopmental skills during infancy and to use a theory-driven approach to explore the possible contributory factors to developmental progression during infancy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">craniosynostosis, neuropsychology, child development</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8539</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activity of genioglossus motor units over sleep onset and arousal from sleep</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Vanessa Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The transitions to and from sleep are critical periods for the genioglossus (GG) muscle and for general respiratory activity. Multiunit recordings suggest that the GG is important for patency of the upper airway (UA) as well as being a model for the activity of all muscles in the UA region. Multiunit EMG recordings show phasic GG activity falling at sleep onset, before increasing as nREM sleep progresses. Airway patency, which is attributable to UA muscles, is compromised during sleep and airway occlusion can occur in susceptible individuals. Arousal from sleep leads to an increase in UA muscle activity with inspiratory multiunit recruitment of the GG known to occur. It is thought that arousals are involved in maintaining patency of the UA, with arousals hypothesised to be involved in reopening the airway following an apneic event in sleep disordered breathing (SDB) syndromes such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), although an opposing view suggests that arousals are incidental, rather than essential, events.

Invertebrates are the most diverse of all biota and play important roles in maintaining forest processes. However, little is known about invertebrates in New Zealand's beech forests or the degree to which selective beech harvest might impact on their diversity and ability to carry out ecosystem processes. Studying ecosystem responses to disturbance is considered vital for understanding how ecosystems are maintained. One of the main objectives of this research was to assess whether litter-dwelling invertebrates were susceptible to the impacts of selective harvest and, if so, whether they could be used as indicators of forest health. Changes in invertebrate diversity could have important implications for nutrient cycling and primary production in forests. Litter-dwelling invertebrates contribute to the process of decomposition by increasing the surface area of the leaves, mixing soil organic matter and by infecting leaf particles with soil microbes. This investigation into the function of invertebrates in beech forest was carried out in the context of ecological theories which relate diversity to ecosystem stability and resilience.  A replicated study was established in Maruia State Forest (South Island, New Zealand) to assess the potential biotic and abiotic impacts of sustainable beech harvest. Litter-dwelling invertebrates and environmental factors were monitored during 1997, before harvest, to determine how much variability there was between study sites. Specifically, litter pH, light intensity, litter fall, litter temperature, moisture as well as invertebrate abundance and diversity were compared before and after selective harvest. On 17 January 1998, two to three trees were selectively harvested from three of the nine study sites. On 15 February 1998 a similar number of trees were winched over or felled manually to create artificial windthrow sites. The remaining three undisturbed sites were used as controls. Invertebrates belonging to the detritivore guild were assessed from litter samples and a series of litter-bags containing pre-weighed leaf litter which were placed in each of the sites to assess rates of litter decomposition.  Millipedes (Diplopoda: Polyzoniidae, Schedotrigonidae, Dalodesmidae, Habrodesmidae, Sphaerotheridae), earthworms (Oligochaeta: Annelida), tipulid larvae (Diptera: Tipulidae), weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), moth larvae (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae, Tortricidae and Psychidae), slaters (Isopoda: Styloniscidae), Oribatid mites (Acarina: Cryptostigmata) and landhoppers (Crustacea: Amphipoda) were extracted from the litter-bags and their abundance and diversity was compared between the three treatments. Weight loss from the litter-bags and the carbon and nitrogen content of litter were used to measure the rate of decomposition in each treatment. An additional study investigated whether exclusion of invertebrates from leaf litter resulted in reduced rates of decomposition. The results indicated that there was an increase in light intensity and a small increase in temperature following selective harvest and artificial windthrow. There was no significant difference in litter moisture or the amount of litter fall between the treatments. Invertebrate abundances were significantly affected by season but did not appear to be affected by selective harvest or artificial windthrow. The diversity of invertebrates remained relatively constant throughout the year, as did the rate of decomposition. When invertebrates were excluded from the leaf litter there was no consequential effect on the rate of litter decomposition. This suggests that there may be compensatory mechanisms taking place between the trophic levels of the food web to maintain processes and that direct links between invertebrates and decomposition are relatively weak.  In conclusion, it appears that the effects of selective beech harvest on forest-floor processes were minimal and are comparable to those created by natural windthrow disturbance. It also appears that macroclimatic effects such as seasonal climatic effects have a large effect on forest biota. As none of the invertebrates studied appeared to be detrimentally affected by selective harvest and as there was no direct link demonstrated with decomposition, it was considered inappropriate to advocate the use of this group of invertebrates as indicators of sustainable forest management. The results from this study provide information which may help inform decisions on the future management of diversity in beech forest ecosystems.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nothofagus</field><field name="subject">beech</field><field name="subject">forest</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">decomposition</field><field name="subject">ecosystem processes</field><field name="subject">selective harvest</field><field name="subject">disturbance</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">detritivores</field><field name="subject">litter-bags</field><field name="subject">indicator species</field><field name="subject">taxa</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300604 Management and environment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1717</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water law and the nature of customary water rights in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kalinoe, Lawrence Kuna</field><field name="description">Majority of the indigenous people in Papua New Guinea (about 87 per cent) live on their customary land by engaging in fishing, hunting, gathering and subsistence agriculture for their daily sustenance. Water is obtained directly from rivers, lakes, and other watercourses.At present, Papua New Guinea is undergoing rapid economic growth in forestry, agroforestry, mining, and petroleum development activities. Most (if not all) of these natural resources development activities are conducted on customary land and in and around the environment in which the majority of the indigenous peoples live and on which they rely for their subsistence way of life. Many of these natural resource development projects have caused stress on the water resources: indeed in some instances, the projects have so impaired the quality of the water and water resources as to render such resources unsuitable for human consumption, and thereby adversely affecting the indigenous peoples' subsistence way of life.This has in turn prompted many indigenous peoples to aggressively assert their customary rights as customary right holders to the land and water resources. The now abandoned law suit by the customary water rights holders of the OK Tedi river discussed in Chapter 13 of this thesis stands as a pre-eminent example of this response.The law in Papua New Guinea allows for the customs of the indigenous peoples of the country to be pleaded and applied as law. In keeping with this, statute law on water resources management does not extinguish customary water use rights but allows for coexistence with statute based water use rights. Whilst on the one hand statute based water use rights are elaborately specified, on the other hand, customary water rights are left unspecified and hence remain vague. The challenge therefore is to ascertain the nature of customary water rights. That challenge is the focus of this thesis.To properly meet that challenge, it is imperative that we understand the customary regime by studying the customs, practices and perceptions of the owners of customary land adjacent to rivers, lakes and other watercourses about their rights over water and water resources (as holders of customary water rights).This thesis attempts to do that by first exploring and presenting, by way of introduction in Part I, the general and basic water law principles pertinent to indigenous water use rights at common law and secondly in Part II, by scrutinising the statutory water law regime in Papua New Guinea to ascertain the possible impacts on the exercise of customary water rights. Thirdly and more importantly, Part III presents and discusses empirical field work data on the customs, practices and perceptions of customary water rights holders. Finally Part IV, attempts to ascertain the nature in law of customary water rights and the modes of establishing and enforcing customary water right at Papua New Guinea law.In the final analysis, it is asserted in this thesis that customary water rights as they currently exist in Papua New Guinea are rights in the nature of property rights and therefore capable of enforcement by the holders of those rights in the event of breach. Customary water rights as they occur in Papua New Guinea are not mere water use rights but rather encompass and include not only the right to the take and use of water per se, but also the access rights to all of the other water resources, both living and non living which occur in the rivers, lakes and other watercourses which the indigenous people have  rights over.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1862</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting language change: a critical study of Habermas's theory of communicative action</field><field name="creator">Sawarjuwono, Tjiptohadi</field><field name="description">This study envisages the accounting function in practice, particularly as a language of business or organisations. The linguistic function becomes more important if being studied from the uttering capability point of view which this study calls "accounting language communicative competence". This idea is inspired by Habermas's intellectual insight. Habermas contends that the most important element in understanding social phenomena is communicative competence rather than linguistic competence.  Communicative competence means the mastery of an ideal speech situation, it encompasses not only the syntactic or semantic systems of language but also the rationality underlying the speech. This study argues that this insight is admissible for understanding accounting phenomena. Thus, accounting language communicative competence refers to the ability to understand accounting language and, in turn, to utter or implement it "properly" by considering all situations within its context. Specifically, this study focuses on organisational actors' accounting language communicative competence. Put another way, accounting language communicative competence is a manifestation of complex interactions among organisational actors, their knowledge and their circumstances. To illustrate this complexity, this study offers a metaphor, that is, a Javanese language speech level metaphor.  To construct this knowledge, this study applies critical accounting study, a methodology which is based on linguistic philosophy, because linguistic philosophy adds a dimension well beyond the scope of accounting and opens wide the nuance of accounting (Gaffikin, 1989) and provides more comprehensive insights. Hence, critical accounting study can accommodate these crucial insights. Essentially, Habermas provides a social theory which is based on it, that is, the theory of communicative action. Seen from this perspective, accounting [language] practice is a social product and follows social processes. Accordingly, it can be analysed from Habermas's two societal analytical processes, that is, lifeworld and system mechanism. To develop the research methods, this study modifies Laughlin's (1987) methodological approaches which are derived from Habermas's conceptual strategies.The results are suggestive and conclusive. They substantially imply that critical accounting study is practical and useful. It benefits both the researcher and the researched participants. Moreover, it allows accounting language change which will be more apparent if the researcher stays longer in the empirical world. However, with the limited time, this study can only ensure that there is a strong inclination towards accounting change</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1012</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of trade unions on the economic performance of the Australian building and construction industry: 1984-1996</field><field name="creator">Knight, Warren B.</field><field name="description">In order to estimate the effects of unions on the economic performance of the Australian Building and Construction Industry for the period 1984- 1996, an OLS regression is performed with union density acting as the measure of industry unionism.

This paper finds that higher levels of union density are associated with increases in output and profits, a result that may have been surprising if the union voice function had been excluded from all reckoning. No significant result was recorded for the indicator of productivity. Voice, it is argued, was the key factor in producing the estimated results. The voice expressed by unions in the period under review (1984-1996) differed markedly from the voice expressed in the period immediately before it. It was this alteration in the expression of voice that represented the changing role of unions in the industry. From being overtly militant and anti-capitalist, they moved towards a position where at times they were incorporated into the greater movement of the neo-corporatist ethic.

The majority of estuarine systems in this region of southeast Australia are intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs). The fish communities within these coastal lakes have not been previously studied in detail. The sampling method employed in this study was aimed at the capture of new recruits, mainly small juveniles of marine and estuarine fish species using the seagrass beds as a nursery habitat, as well as species that were permanent residents of the seagrass meadows. Research was conducted over a three-year period in eight estuaries spanning approximately 500km of southern New South Wales (NSW). These estuaries are Lake Illawarra, St Georges Basin, Lake Conjola, Burrill Lake, Durras Lake, Coila Lake, Wallaga Lake and Merimbula Lake. Within seven of these estuaries, three locations representative of the entrance, central and upper locations were sampled quarterly for three years. Fish sampling was undertaken using a seine net (6mm stretch mesh, 25m long), primarily in Zostera capricomi seagrass beds. Environmental data was also recorded during each sampling event, and included salinity, conductivity, temperature, pH and turbidity.Overall, 101 fish species were found within the region. Within individual estuaries species diversity ranged from 41 to 61 species. The most specious families were the Gobiidae, Syngnathidae and Monacanthidae. The catch was dominated by large abundances of a few species, particularly from the Ambassidae, Atherinidae and Gobiidae families. There were significant spatial and temporal differences in the species diversity of seagrass fish fauna for each individual estuary. With the exception with Merimbula Lake, spatial and temporal differences in the abundance of fish were also evident. However, there was little consistency to these patterns, either within estuaries or between them. The location factor had little influence on fish diversity and abundance patterns, and there were no decline in species diversity and abundance with increasing distance from the estuary mouth. The largest percentage of variation was due to either lower species diversity or abundance found during the winter months, or large single catches of schooling fish species.Fish community dynamics were investigated by multivariate analyses. The results indicated that the fish species compositions within each estuary were highly similar on a spatial scale. There was little compositional change in the fish assemblages with increasing distance from the estuary mouth. Yearly changes in fish community composition were more noticeable than seasonal changes. It was found that the south coast fish fauna was composed of a "core" group of species that were caught consistently throughout time and were found at all locations. There were no 'restricted' species that had strong or distinct location-associations within these estuaries. Rather, some species may have had preferences for certain regions but were not restricted to them.Commercial fish species diversity and abundance patterns were investigated for six of the estuaries, and the recruitment dynamics of five major species were also examined for seven of the estuaries. The major findings were that there was a substantial increase in the strength of recruitment in 1998, and this was evident across all of the selected species and across all estuaries. This indicated that for these commercially important species, processes responsible for widespread and substantial increase in recruitment must be large-scale, and not restrictive processes confined to an individual species life-history characteristics or to a particular local area. Rainfall data from the south coast of NSW, and data relating to El Nino phenomena were discussed as the probable trigger for the high recruitment that occurred in the spring/summer of 1998. Overall, there were no consistent sites of recruitment in these ICOLLs, and patterns of settlement for all species at the three locations within each estuary were not consistent through time. However, there were small regional differences in the timing and magnitude of recruitment in the seven estuaries along a latitudinal scale.The results from the large-scale sampling program indicated that local processes within individual ICOLLs may be a much more important factor in the structuring of these fish communities than differences in geomorphology or biogeography for these ICOLLs. To investigate these local processes in detail, a sampling program was undertaken in two estuaries. Lake Illawarra and Durras Lake. These two estuaries were chosen, as they are very different systems in terms of shape and size, entrance conditions and degree of catchment and lake usage. Sampling of the shallow water seagrass fish communities was conducted at thirty-two sites within each estuary every six weeks for one year. The high degree of similarity in the shallow water fish community around each estuary that was found in the larger sampling program was still evident at a finer scale of sampling, and there were still inconsistent patterns of settlement through time within each estuary. This intensive sampling program provided a clearer understanding of the effects of individual lake morphology and hydrology on fish community patterns.Consideration of the information and conclusions from the two sampling programs have led to a number of hypotheses. It is proposed that lake morphology, individual hydrological characteristics and the local climatic regime are important determinants in the structuring of ICOLL fish assemblages in southeast Australia. The patterns in fish diversity and abundance, and in community dynamics were contrary to traditional concepts of estuarine fish patterns, which have been largely developed from research carried out in large riverine and permanently open estuaries, or in intermittently open estuaries where there are distinct seasonal rainfall patterns that influence the salinity gradients within the estuary. It would appear that the small size of ICOLLs in southern NSW, lack of seasonal rainfall patterns, the dominance of wind-induced transport rather than tidal-induced water transport, and the relatively stable salinity around the perimeter of the ICOLLs allows the widespread distribution of marine spawning species within these systems.This research has direct implications for the sustainable management and conservation of ICOLL environments and their fish communities. These coastal lakes were found to be important fish habitats, particularly in terms of their role as recruitment and nursery areas for a wide range of marine and estuarine species. However there were few, if any, consistent patterns in species recruitment, diversity and abundance, either between locations within estuaries, between estuaries within the region, or between seasons and years. Local hydrology, morphology and climate affecting individual ICOLLs are the most important factors structuring fish communities. Currently these ICOLLs are managed using a generic approach, based on the assumption that different ICOLLs have similar ecological characteristics. Based on the results from this research, the most suitable approach for management purposes is to consider each estuary as a unique situation requiring a detailed and localised approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1869</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes of Australian small business firms and financial institutions towards the profit/loss sharing method of finance</field><field name="creator">Jalaluddin, Abul</field><field name="description">Small business firms usually obtain finance from commercial lenders on fixed or variable rates of interest. These businesses, or any other borrower for that matter, will have to pay back the principal borrowed along with its stipulated interest at the end of the specified period. They are willing to pay the interest on the loan over and above the principal borrowed because they expect the borrowed amount of capital would make a marginal contribution in their profit at least equal to the total interest paid. They are legally liable for the payment of the interest and the principal regardless of their actual level of earnings. They must make these payments as per contract even if they suffer heavy losses in the project. This arrangement, which is common in most, if not all countries of the world, may cause a great deal of hardship on the part of the borrowers, especially at times of economic slowdown.There is a method of finance called profit/loss sharing practiced in some South-East Asian and Middle Eastern countries. A number of financial institutions in the Western countries including UK, Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland has been applying this method since the early 1980s.The main objective of this thesis is to find out the attitudes towards, motivations for and probability of using the profit/loss sharing principle of finance by the Australian small businesses and financial institutions. Two surveys were conducted to achieve this objective. Multivariate statistical analysis, especially factor analysis, discriminant analysis and logit and probit regressions, was applied to the survey results.Factor analysis identified five factors which may explain why small businesses are motivated to borrow funds using the profit/loss sharing method of finance. These factors are business support, risk sharing, risk of default in the traditional system, cost of borrowing and suitability of the profit/loss sharing method. Another three factors were identified to provide reasons why small businesses would not borrow funds using this new principle namely, terms of borrowing, management intervention and high cost of borrowing.Discriminant analysis indicates that risk sharing between borrowers and lenders is the most important predictor in discriminating between the two groups of small businesses those who would and those who would not like to borrow funds using this method. The other discriminating variables include motivation for business expansion, cost of borrowing and management intervention.The logit and probit models show that the higher the degree of risk sharing, the lesser the cost of borrowing and the greater the motivation to business expansion, the higher the probability that the small businesses would apply the profit/loss sharing method. The respondents also indicated that the lower the degree of management intervention, the higher the likelihood that the small businesses would be prepared to apply this method of finance.A large number of variables determining the motives of financial institutions to lend funds on the basis of the profit/loss sharing method were reduced to four factors namely, business support, growth in demand for funds, risk of default under the traditional system and potential higher return to lenders. At least three underlying factors may explain why some financial institutions would not like to lend funds on this basis namely, management complication, unfamiliarity of the profit/loss sharing method and risk sharing with borrowers.Discriminant analysis applied to financial institutions suggests that the growth in demand for funds is the most important predictor in discriminating between the financial institutions who are prepared to lend money on the basis of the profit/loss sharing method and those who are not. The other significantly discriminating variables include the potential higher return on funds, depositors' concern, monetary regulation, management complexity and risk sharing with borrowers.As a majority of the responding small businesses (59.5%) are willing to borrow and a sizeable percentage of the financial institutions (41.2%) are willing to lend funds on the principle of the profit/loss sharing, the Australian monetary authority could consider offering this new method of finance as an integral part of the Australian financial system.The financial institutions may introduce the new method on a trial basis to selected customers. The financial institutions should find some mechanisms to minimise the concerns of depositors for lending their money using this principle, perhaps through obtaining prior consent of depositors in this regard. They should also conduct serious research in the areas of simplified business performance monitoring, auditing and record keeping to minimise the cost of lending and secure a greater share of the market.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of coal trade in the Wollongong district of New South Wales, with particular reference to government and business, 1849-1889</field><field name="creator">Lee, Henry Patrick</field><field name="description">The argument in the thesis is organised in three parts. Part I, comprising Chapters 1 to 5, inclusive, examines the period 1849-1871. It establishes the factors leading to the location of the first mines on the Wollongong coalfield, as well as to the formation of the coalition of local businessmen that had as its object the attraction to the district of as much mining capital as it could absorb. They identified the lack of a natural harbour as the great obstacle to the attainment of that objective and, through electoral manipulation, succeeded in having the New South Wales government construct a coal port at public expense. The port was completed in 1868, but proved a grand failure. Owners of capital responded to market and profit considerations rather than to the efforts of small business to overcome such considerations with artificial inducements provided at public expense. Consequently, by 1871, following recessions in 1863/64 and 1870, only a handful of mines were operating in the Wollongong Coalfield. Part II, containing Chapters 6 to 10, inclusive, deals with the response of the businessmen to the failure of their Wollongong Harbour policy. Initially demoralised and confused, they soon formulated a new variant of their policy&#8212;a railway linking the coalfield with Sydney Harbour, 50 miles to the north. This was a vastly more expensive proposition than a small coal port located in Wollongong. At first it attracted no support from government, which prompted the businessmen to sound out investors in Sydney with a view to forming a private company which would build and operate the Line. That too failed to materialise.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1441</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Historical Traditions of the Australian Senate: the Upper House we Had to Have.</field><field name="creator">Marchant, Sylvia</field><field name="description">Abstract
This thesis examines the raison d&#239;&#191;&#189;etre of the Australian Senate, the upper house of the Australian bicameral parliament, established in 1901. It explores the literature that might have influenced its establishment and structure, and the attitudes, ideals, experience and expectations of the men (and they were all men) who initiated its existence and designed its structure during the Federation Conventions of the 1890s. It goes on to study whether similar western and British influenced institutions were seen as models by the designers of the Senate, followed by an examination of its architecture, d&#239;&#191;&#189;cor, and procedures, to determine the major influences at work on these aspects of the institution.
The study was undertaken in view of the paucity of studies of the history and role of the Senate in relation to its powerful influence on the Government of Australia. Its structure can allow a minority of Senators to subvert or obstruct key measures passed by the lower house and is a serious issue for Governments in considering legislation. Answers are sought to the questions of how and why it was conceived and created and what role it was expected to play. The study does not extend beyond 1901 when the Senate was established except to examine the Provisional Parliament House, opened in 1927, which realised the vision of the Convention delegates who determined that the Senate was the house we had to have.
The research approach began with an exhaustive study of the Records of the Federal Conventions of the 1890s, where the Constitution of Australia was drawn up, along with contemporary writings and modern comment on such institutions. A study of the men who designed the Senate was carried out, augmented with field visits to the Australian State Parliaments. Research was also conducted into upper houses identified by the delegates to the Australian Federal Conventions, to consider their influence on the design of the Senate.
The conclusion is that the Senate was deliberately structured to emulate the then existing British system as far as possible; it was to be an august house of review and a bastion against democracy, or at least a check on hasty legislation. The delegates showed no desire to extinguish ties with Great Britain and their vision of an upper house was modelled directly on the House of Lords. The vast majority of delegates had cut their teeth in colonial upper houses, which were themselves closely modelled on the Lords. To not establish a Senate would have been to turn their backs on themselves. The Senate then, is not a hybrid of Washington and Westminster: the influence of the United States was limited to the composition of the Senate and its name and mediated through the filter of its British heritage. The example of other legislatures was unimportant except where it solved problems previously experienced in the Colonial Councils and which might have otherwise occurred in the Senate. The Senate was the upper house we had to have; it was a decision that was taken before the delegates even met.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Senate</field><field name="subject">Upper House</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">Federal Conventions</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100723.095617</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#239;&#191;&#189;If we can&#239;&#191;&#189;t measure it,

The role of health outcomes in community and allied health service accountability.</field><field name="creator">Nancarrow, Susan Alison</field><field name="description">Health outcomes fulfill a number of roles in the health sector. Economists, clinicians, researchers and managers use health outcomes in a range of different contexts for distinct purposes. New management approaches that use contracts as the basis for health service accountability have attempted to take health outcomes from their clinical role into a management setting. In particular, the purchasers and managers of some health services expect that service providers should demonstrate that they improve the health outcomes of their patients to justify their on-going funding.
However, a number of organisations have experienced barriers to the application of the outcomes approach to health service management and there has been no systematic evaluation of the approach. Nor has there been an investigation into why purchasing organisations have difficulty introducing health outcomes into purchasing contracts. The result is that managers and purchasers continue to assign resources to the pursuit of health outcomes as an accountability tool. 
This thesis addresses two research questions around the use of health outcomes in community and allied health service accountability. The first is the barriers to the application of health outcomes to health services accountability. The second question examines the conditions that must be met before health outcomes can be used as an accountability tool in purchasing contracts for allied health. 
The research questions are addressed through the analysis of case studies that explore systematically the approach taken by two organisations, the Department of Veterans&#239;&#191;&#189; Affairs and ACT Community Care, in their attempts to identify health outcomes that could be used in purchasing contracts for community and allied health services. The case study analysis uses a health services research approach that draws on multidisciplinary techniques including epidemiology, health services management and anthropology.
The thesis describes the accountability interactions within the purchaser-provider model. Accountability is not a uniform construct. It consists of many domains, levels and interactions. In health service delivery, there are a number of different actors and a wide range of interactions for which they are accountable. Two important interactions are identified: professional accountability, which describes the accountability of the health service professional to their patient; and contractual accountability, which is the obligation of the health service provider (or providing organisation) to the purchaser through their contractual agreement. I conclude that health outcomes are not an appropriate domain of contractual accountability but they are an important component of professional accountability and I discuss the implications of these finding for theory and practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health outcomes</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">primary care</field><field name="subject">allied health</field><field name="subject">physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">podiatry</field><field name="subject">occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Department of Veterans Affairs</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100707.182200</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HUMAN SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF CAMBODIA</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Peter Thomas</field><field name="description">Human security was promoted in 1994 by the UNDP as a concept embracing not only freedom from war and violence (or personal security), but also embracing individual&#239;&#191;&#189;s basic needs for (and rights to) economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, community security and political security.   Following this formulation, the concept has been subject to considerable scrutiny particularly in the context of state centric security studies.  Extending the concept of security beyond the state to the individual appeared problematic, especially as the mechanisms designed to maintain and restore world peace are state based.  However, the post-cold war environment has required a renewed interest in conflict resolution and in this context, human security as personal security has achieved political and analytical acceptance, particularly in the UN sponsored Human Security Report.  What then of the second dimension of human security as freedom from want expressed by the UNDP in terms of basic needs and rights?
Debate on this aspect of the UNDP definition foundered on several fronts.  As well as being outside the traditional security framework, many argued that it was too broad to be analytically useful; others that it added nothing to human rights and human development which appeared to address precisely the same issues.  Thus, while the concept of human security has found acceptance by those advocating with humanitarian approaches to conflict resolution and prevention, few have addressed the actual relationship, if any, between human security and development at the local level where people are most vulnerable to insecurity and where human security or its absence is most felt.
This thesis addresses this gap through a study of human security in Cambodia, where people have experienced, at different times, the full range of human insecurities detailed by the UNDP.  It shows that the human insecurity of Cambodians has been in large part a consequence of the security policies and military engagements of external powers.  Human security and international relations are inextricably linked.  Cambodia&#239;&#191;&#189;s post-conflict reconstruction, rehabilitation and development strategies have also been strongly influenced by international forces through development assistance programmes.  Despite this aid, Cambodia&#239;&#191;&#189;s performance in health, education, justice, employment and poverty alleviation has been poor and leaves many rural people with uncertain futures and their human security threatened.  
Various authors have suggested that human security might be guaranteed by the state, the rule of law, democratisation, governance, human rights or human development.  Based on qualitative fieldwork, the thesis argues that governance &#239;&#191;&#189; especially the way in which state institutions deliver services to the people at the local or &#239;&#191;&#189;grass roots&#239;&#191;&#189; level  &#239;&#191;&#189; is key to assuring human security.  It further argues that through development assistance policies and practices, global governance institutions have a significant influence on national and local governance processes.  
The thesis concludes that, if accepted by the UN Security Council, global governance and international development assistance agencies, human security can be a bridge uniting them all in the common pursuit of individual security and wellbeing with benefit for state, regional and global security.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human security</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">Security Council</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100701.122958</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confronting the new generation of stellar model atmospheres with observations</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Tiago Mendes Domingos</field><field name="description">Stellar model atmospheres are a fundamental tool for our understanding of stars. Because the chemical composition of stars cannot be measured directly, the inferred stellar parameters are model dependent. In recent years great progress has been made in the modeling of stellar atmospheres, allowing the relaxation of simplifying assumptions made in previous models. The use of new 3D model atmospheres to infer the solar chemical composition has resulted in a decrease of the solar metallicity. This result has caused some controversy and is being challenged.

The main aim of this thesis is to ascertain if the new models of stellar atmospheres are realistic and can be trusted to derive the chemical composition of stars in general, and the Sun in particular. Other objectives also include the study of line formation in the Sun at high spatial resolution, and possible implications in the modeling.

The Sun is the ideal test-bench for detailed analyses of stellar atmospheres. With the solar surface being resolved in great detail and at different viewing angles, a wealth of information can be gathered that allows for very robust tests of atmosphere models. The testing detailed here addresses several fronts. On one hand, the model&#239;&#191;&#189;s temperature structure is directly tested with the classical tests of continuum centre-to-limb variations and absolute fluxes. On the other hand, the line formation is tested at different viewing angles and high spatial and spectral resolution. Here the main focus is on oxygen lines, as oxygen has an important contribution for the total solar metallicity. However, other lines are also tested. High quality data were specifically obtained for these line formation tests, using the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope.

For the temperature structure tests we find a surprisingly good agreement between the 3D model and the observations, surpassing even semi-empirical models. The solar 1D non-LTE models have a very similar behaviour to 1D LTE models, confirming that LTE is a good approximation in the solar photosphere. The 3D theoretical model performs consistently better than its 1D counterparts. The oxygen line formation tests are carried out in great detail, with a careful wavelength calibration, revised atomic data, and allowing for departures from LTE. Again we find a reassuring agreement between the 3D model predictions and the observations, both for the centre-to-limb variation of the lines and the line formation at high spatial resolution. The observations at different viewing angles also allowed the empirical determination of the role of hydrogen collisions with oxygen, important when deriving the oxygen abundance.

The tests undertaken here show that the 3D model atmospheres are indeed very realistic. Their predicted temperature structure and velocity fields compare very favourably with observations of the Sun. Together with previous tests, this indicates they can be relied upon to derive the chemical composition of the Sun and similar late-type stars.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stellar atmospheres</field><field name="subject">radiative transfer</field><field name="subject">sun</field><field name="subject">granulation</field><field name="subject">abundances</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100701.165106</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A perception-influence model of innovation implementation in project related based engineering</field><field name="creator">Miller, Andrew</field><field name="description">Innovation is an imperative in all industry sectors. For those such as construction, which are not considered high-tech and which operate as one-off projects, the uptake and diffusion of new innovations into ongoing practice across projects pose particular problems. The nature of these problems faced at a project level needs to be better understood. This thesis is an exploration of innovation implementation in the context of Project-Based Engineering (PBE). It is an empirical investigation of how new planning technologies are implemented in major infrastructure construction projects and the barriers that prevent such implementations from being effective. The findings of this investigation are used to develop and evaluate a new model of innovation implementation in this context. The research design is centred on the immersion of a participant-observer in seven live construction projects over a period of 3.5 years. Each project studied was implementing the same innovation: 4D CAD modelling (3D design model + the construction schedule). A wide cross-section of data was gathered in the field including direct observations, documents and other work products from participation, email and other correspondence associated with the 4D CAD implementations, and formal and informal discussions with project-participants. These data were analysed using content analysis software to find patterns. The research was iterative and involved three phases. The initial phase was a pilot study of implementation in practice using the data from one project. It produced rich descriptions of what transpired and a critical comparison with accounts from the literature. This led to a series of propositions about the influence of project-participant perceptions that were synthesised into a new theoretical model: the initial Perception-Influence model (P-I1 model). The middle research phase then developed this model iteratively using a more-focused data collection and content analysis across four construction project organisations. This was done to provide supporting evidence for the theoretical constructs in the P-I1 model as well as to refine them and add new ones. The outcomes of the middle phase were the P-I2 and P-I3 models. The final research phase analysed the data from the last two project organisations in terms of the P-I model framework with a view to evaluating the model&#8217;s theoretical significance and practical applications. The P-I model shows that negative perceptions of value, benefit and usability can cause an innovation implementation to be ineffective as a result of discontinued use or neglect. It provides a map for the progression of an implementation using the perceptions and actions of project-participants as primary constructs. The model proposes that each perception is formed by a number of contributing factors or secondary constructs synthesised from implementation research and user acceptance literature, for example, an opinion or concern about how much an innovation costs (i.e. transaction costs). It also proposes that each perception has both a positive and negative associated action. The constructs that make up the P-I model are grounded in the empirical data. This is because the actions, opinions and concerns of project-participants observed in live projects are evident in project documentation such as emails. These two sources (i.e. observations and project documentation) provide data sets that were used to triangulate inferences about the perceptions of project-participants and the outcome of each 4D CAD implementation (i.e. effective or otherwise). This aspect of the research was not only important for the recommendation of potential applications for the P-I model but also during its conception, development and evaluation. The P-I model is a new and important perspective for both implementation research and PBE practitioners. It helps satisfy the calls for studies of innovation implementation that focus on factors at an individual level and those asking for a better understanding of innovative behaviour. This work shows PBE practitioners how the perceptions of project-participants can have a major impact on the effectiveness of an innovation implementation. The findings provide an evidential basis that can improve implementation effectiveness, especially in PBE organisations. The knowledge built into the P-I model can also assist the planning and execution of innovation implementation strategies, aid in the assessment and redirection of those in progress, and help document lessons learned for implementations within project organisations that have been previously completed. This research uses the P-I model to open the way for future empirical studies of innovation implementation in PBE contexts beyond construction. These would also provide data to further refine the constructs in the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Innovation implementation</field><field name="subject">Project-based engineering</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Influence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187785</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans.

The study investigated initial effects of cattle grazing on the dynamics of five perennial, tropical legumes in association with two contrasting grass species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">070399 Crop and Pasture Production not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Siratro</field><field name="subject">Macroptilium</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="subject">cattle grazing</field><field name="subject">grasses</field><field name="subject">tropical</field><field name="subject">perennial</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209774</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of maize plant populations and cowpea varieties on radiation interception, growth and yield of maize/cowpea intercrops</field><field name="creator">Watiki, James M.</field><field name="description">An experiment was carried out at Redland Bay on the south-eastern coast of Queensland from (16/2/1991 to 27/6/1991) in an attempt to relate the performance of maize (Zea mays L.)/cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp.) intercrops to radiation interception and to radiation availability to cowpea and to ascertain the effects of cowpea morphological characteristics. A quick maturing maize cultivar (DK529) and two cowpea cultivars (Red Caloona and 672330) were used. Changes in light availability to cowpea in intercrops were made by varying maize density. Three plant population densities were used: 22,000 plants ha^-1, 44,000 plants ha^-1, and 67,000 plants ha^-1. Both cowpea cultivars were very vegetative and vigorous in growth with little difference in their morphological characteristics. Cowpea cultivar 1 (Red Caloona) was however a better climber and retained green leaves for a longer duration. Increasing maize plant population density effectively reduced the amount of light reaching the cowpea canopy. Light availability was reduced to a minimum of 13% and 15% in the high maize plant population density and to a minimum of 47% and 42% in the low maize plant population density in cowpea cultivar 1 and 2 respectively. Intercropping reduced growth and yield of both cowpea cultivars through reductions in cowpea leaf area index (LAI), light interception and pod number. It also caused reductions in seed size in cowpea cultivar 2 (67233). Increasing maize plant population density further reduced all the above parameters. Maize growth and yield was affected by intercropping but to a lesser extent. Maize yields were reduced by 16% and 14% under cowpea cultivar 1 and cowpea cultivar 2 respectively, compared to an average reduction of 68% and 82% in cowpea cultivars 1 and 2 across the 3 maize plant population density. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) of the intercrops was lower than that of maize sole crop but higher than that of cowpea sole crop. Intercropping proved to be more advantageous in the vegetative stages of growth than in the reproductive stage except in the medium maize plant population density treatment. This was attributed to better light use efficiency in the early growth in intercrops than sole crops which was estimated to be between 1.1 and 2.9 time higher in intercrops than in sole maize in the first 20 days after sowing (DAMS) . Results indicated that LAI and leaf longevity had a large effect on radiation interception and use in cowpea. Cowpea cultivar 2 was better yielding in sole crop that cowpea cultivar 1 (954 Vs 621 Kgha^-1) but was more affected by intercrop (157 Vs Kgha^-1). An advantage of intercropping was only obtained in the medium maize plant population density intercrops. These were however small advantages (13% and 11%) in cowpea cultivar 2 and cultivar 1 respectively. Intercropping maize with these two cowpea cultivars would therefore be of advantage only, where the interest of the farmer is in the production of maize grain and cowpea leaf, wither for consumption, livestock feed or as green manure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corn -- Planting.</field><field name="subject">Cowpea.</field><field name="subject">Cowpea -- Planting.</field><field name="subject">Intercropping.</field><field name="subject">Corn.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209763</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of key stakeholders in sustainable tourism development: the case study of Nelson/Marlborough/Golden Bay in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sassenberg, Ulrike</field><field name="description">Contemporary tourism planning recognises that an integrated and sustainable development approach includes the participation of local communities and residents. Success depends on community level capacity for innovation and leadership which are important variables for the creation and implementation of new ideas as part of the development process. The main aim of this research is to determine the capacity of stakeholders to support integration of tourism and aquaculture through development of a themed seafood tourism trail in the Nelson/Marlborough/Golden Bay region of New Zealand as a means to promote sustainable tourism. In 2005 the Marine Farming Association developed and published the &#8220;Top of the South Aquaculture and Seafood Trail&#8221; as a brochure for tourists to promote a positive image of aquaculture in the region. The Trail integrates local tourism providers, restaurants, accommodation, seafood retail, as well as harvesting and processing businesses (mussel farms) as part of a themed driving route linking several peripheral communities. Themed driving routes are an innovative means for providing destinations with the opportunity to bring tourists and associated economic outcomes to remote locations. There is strong economic dependence on aquaculture and tourism in the region with both industries generating a combined NZ$402 million annually in the Nelson Region alone. The research involved interviews with 22 local stakeholders regarding their perceptions about strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities associated with the Trail as part of a mixed method, case study approach. The results show that tourism and aquaculture in the region are well developed, but that there are weaknesses in networking and collaboration within and among industrial sectors. In addition, there are differing perceptions of the aquaculture and tourism industries. The role of the university has been important in building community capacity for research and strategic planning linked to the Trail.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Seafood tourism</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder</field><field name="subject">Marlborough</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">Trail</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/983</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational Therapists' decisions about the management of upper limb hypertonicity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Rassafiani, Mehdi</field><field name="description">It has been postulated that occupational therapists when choosing an appropriate intervention method, use theoretical and practical knowledge (factors), based upon identifying client's goals to guide their clinical reasoning. The overall aim of this study was to identify factors and their relative contributions to the decisions occupational therapists make in the management of upper limb (UL) hypertonicity of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). Studies about general factors which influence occupational therapists' decision making have been addressed widely in the literature. However, studying influential factors in specific areas such as in the management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP is limited. The information obtained from studies of decision making with other client groups can not readily be generalised as it has been demonstrated that specific task characteristics induce different types of cognitive thinking. For example, working with clients with orthopaedic problems may induce logical thinking, while practicing with clients with neurological problems promotes intuitive thinking. The management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP was chosen as the focus of this study for two main reasons. First, the incidence of CP is high, manifesting in between 1.4 and 2.4 of 1000 live births. Second, people with CP are one of the major client groups referred to occupational therapy (OT) clinics as outpatients. The literature reviewed highlighted a lack of evidence about what therapists attend to when making decisions about the management of UL hypertonicity for clients with CP. To identify and evaluate these factors, the current research employed Social Judgment Theory (SJT). This methodology was selected because it had the capacity to V access intuitive thought or tacit knowledge that is very difficult for experienced therapists to explain. Furthermore, SJT is most relevant in situations where there is no optimal decision. The current study proceeded in five phases. Phases One to Three were conducted to identify the most relevant factors to be used in the case vignettes necessary for the application of SJT. This process involved a review of the literature, consultation with clinical experts and then involved twelve experienced therapists in a process of identifying, refining, and ranking the relevant factors in order of priority. As a result of the processes in Phases One to Three 37 factors and their ranked importance were identified. The identified factors were reduced from 37 to 12 on the basis of ranking, cluster analysis and consultation with experts and appropriate scales identified for their measurement. These factors formed the basis of Phase Four of this study. In Phase Four 10 sample case vignettes as well as an administration manual were developed and four therapists were asked to make decisions for these cases. On the basis of therapists&#146; comments, some changes were made in case vignettes and administration manual. Finally, 110 case vignettes were generated randomly (20 were repeated to examine consistency) for Phase Five of the study. In Phase Five, eighteen occupational therapists (16 females and 2 males), mean age of 36.7 years (SD = 7.6 years) who had worked with people with CP for a mean of 10.4 years (SD = 6.0 years) made decisions for the generated case vignettes. The findings of Phase Five revealed that therapists used three factors mainly in their decisions including severity of spasticity, wrist and finger posture, and client and family background. They had poor insight into their decision making (r = 0.36) and demonstrated only moderate consistency (r = 0.46). When therapists were divided into two groups based on their level of performance in respect to therapists&#146; consistency and their ability to discriminate between cases, both groups used severity of spasticity and wrist and finger posture in their decision making. However, the higher performing group used limitation in passive range of movement and previous intervention in their decision making, and the low performing group used client and family background. To conclude, factors identified as most important (specifically by therapists who performed consistently) could be considered to be the most critical when confronted by a large amount of information. These factors can be used to assist occupational therapy students and new practitioners to focus on relevant information to help support their clinical decisions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Occupational Therapy</field><field name="subject">Cerebral Palsy</field><field name="subject">Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Upper limb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158056</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A perception-influence model of innovation implementation in project related based engineering</field><field name="creator">Miller, Andrew</field><field name="description">Innovation is an imperative in all industry sectors. For those such as construction, which are not considered high-tech and which operate as one-off projects, the uptake and diffusion of new innovations into ongoing practice across projects pose particular problems. The nature of these problems faced at a project level needs to be better understood. This thesis is an exploration of innovation implementation in the context of Project-Based Engineering (PBE). It is an empirical investigation of how new planning technologies are implemented in major infrastructure construction projects and the barriers that prevent such implementations from being effective. The findings of this investigation are used to develop and evaluate a new model of innovation implementation in this context. The research design is centred on the immersion of a participant-observer in seven live construction projects over a period of 3.5 years. Each project studied was implementing the same innovation: 4D CAD modelling (3D design model + the construction schedule). A wide cross-section of data was gathered in the field including direct observations, documents and other work products from participation, email and other correspondence associated with the 4D CAD implementations, and formal and informal discussions with project-participants. These data were analysed using content analysis software to find patterns. The research was iterative and involved three phases. The initial phase was a pilot study of implementation in practice using the data from one project. It produced rich descriptions of what transpired and a critical comparison with accounts from the literature. This led to a series of propositions about the influence of project-participant perceptions that were synthesised into a new theoretical model: the initial Perception-Influence model (P-I1 model). The middle research phase then developed this model iteratively using a more-focused data collection and content analysis across four construction project organisations. This was done to provide supporting evidence for the theoretical constructs in the P-I1 model as well as to refine them and add new ones. The outcomes of the middle phase were the P-I2 and P-I3 models. The final research phase analysed the data from the last two project organisations in terms of the P-I model framework with a view to evaluating the model&#8217;s theoretical significance and practical applications. The P-I model shows that negative perceptions of value, benefit and usability can cause an innovation implementation to be ineffective as a result of discontinued use or neglect. It provides a map for the progression of an implementation using the perceptions and actions of project-participants as primary constructs. The model proposes that each perception is formed by a number of contributing factors or secondary constructs synthesised from implementation research and user acceptance literature, for example, an opinion or concern about how much an innovation costs (i.e. transaction costs). It also proposes that each perception has both a positive and negative associated action. The constructs that make up the P-I model are grounded in the empirical data. This is because the actions, opinions and concerns of project-participants observed in live projects are evident in project documentation such as emails. These two sources (i.e. observations and project documentation) provide data sets that were used to triangulate inferences about the perceptions of project-participants and the outcome of each 4D CAD implementation (i.e. effective or otherwise). This aspect of the research was not only important for the recommendation of potential applications for the P-I model but also during its conception, development and evaluation. The P-I model is a new and important perspective for both implementation research and PBE practitioners. It helps satisfy the calls for studies of innovation implementation that focus on factors at an individual level and those asking for a better understanding of innovative behaviour. This work shows PBE practitioners how the perceptions of project-participants can have a major impact on the effectiveness of an innovation implementation. The findings provide an evidential basis that can improve implementation effectiveness, especially in PBE organisations. The knowledge built into the P-I model can also assist the planning and execution of innovation implementation strategies, aid in the assessment and redirection of those in progress, and help document lessons learned for implementations within project organisations that have been previously completed. This research uses the P-I model to open the way for future empirical studies of innovation implementation in PBE contexts beyond construction. These would also provide data to further refine the constructs in the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Innovation implementation</field><field name="subject">Project-based engineering</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Influence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187785</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cultural political economy of business strategy in a developing country context : the case of the Sri Lankan tea industry</field><field name="creator">Wickramasinghe, D.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving beyond anarchy : a complex alternative to a realist assumption</field><field name="creator">Kissane, Dylan</field><field name="description">Realist international relations theory is the most influential theoretical approach in the discipline of international relations. Within the realist paradigm there are several realist approaches. Various approaches, including classical realism, neorealism, offensive realism, neo-classical realism, and game theory, are part of the realist paradigm but some make different theoretically relevant assumptions, notably about international politics, international actors and actors' motivations. The first part of this thesis seeks to demonstrate how, despite their other differences, a fundamental assumption that anarchy determines the nature of international politics is characteristic of realist theorists as notable and different as classical realists Thucydides, Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Edward Hallett Carr and Hans Morgenthau, structural realist Kenneth Waltz, offensive realist John Mearsheimer, realist game theory analysis of international relations, and neoclassical realists Victor Cha, Thomas Christenson and Gideon Rose. This demonstration establishes the basis for proceeding to a critique of realists' fundamental anarchy assumption. The second part of this thesis presents an argument that realists' fundamental assumption that anarchy determines the nature of international politics has been responsible for theoretical shortcomings of realist analyses, and argues that a complexity basis for international relations theory would offer theoretical and analytical advantages. The cost of the assumption of anarchy for realist analyses is demonstrated in a critique of realist accounts of the outbreak of World War I, the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and regional political integration in Europe. These major international developments should be readily addressed by the realist or any other paradigm of international relations theory. In all three cases, the factors involved leave realists struggling to re-visit their assumptions about international politics in order to explain what occurred. While such re-assessments have included a variety of efforts to broaden or redefine the factors considered, the role and implications of anarchy as a foundational assumption of realist theorising has rarely been questioned, and it remains a central realist premise. Complexity theory is being embraced in a variety of fields of social inquiry, including politics and international relations. This thesis proposes that the complexity of international politics is something that needs to be embraced and not sidelined. This is the case whether the international politics in question was in ancient times or the twenty-first century. The complexity of international politics, not anarchy, needs to be operationalised as the foundational assumption of international relations theory, in order to build international relations theorising on a more appropriate basis that can be applied more fruitfully in the descriptions and explanations of empirical international relations analyses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International relations</field><field name="subject">anarchy</field><field name="subject">international relations theory</field><field name="subject">realism</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/97978</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46269</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and Computational Techniques for Predicting the Squat of Ships</field><field name="creator">Gourlay, Tim Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the squat of a moving ship; that is, the downward displacement and angle of trim caused by its forward motion. The thesis is divided into two parts, in which the ship is considered to be moving in water of constant depth and non-constant depth respectively. In both parts, results are given for ships in channels and in open water.  Since squat is essentially a Bernoulli effect, viscosity is neglected throughout most of the work, which results in a boundary value problem involving Laplace's equation. Only qualitative statements about the effect of viscosity are made.  For a ship moving in water of constant depth, we first consider a one-dimensional theory for narrow channels. This is described for both linearized flow, where the disturbance due to the ship is small, and nonlinear flow, where the disturbance due to the ship is large. For nonlinear flow we develop an iterative method for determining the nonlinear sinkage and trim. Conditions for the existence of steady flow are determined, which take into account the squat of the ship.  We then turn to the problem of ships moving in open water, where one-dimensional theory is no longer applicable. A well-known slender-body shallow-water theory is modified to remove the singularity which occurs when the ship's speed is equal to the shallow-water wave speed. This is done by including the effect of dispersion, in a manner similar to the derivation of the Korteweg-deVries equation. A finite-depth theory is also used to model the flow near the critical speed.  For a ship moving in water of non-uniform depth, a linearized one-dimensional theory is derived which is applicable to unsteady flow. This is applied to simple bottom topographies, using analytic as well as numerical methods. A corresponding slender-body shallow-water theory for variable depth is also developed, which is valid for ships in channels or open water. Numerical results are given for a step depth change, and an analytic solution to the problem is discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">squat, ship, shallow water</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A life course approach to measuring socioeconomic position in population surveillance and its role in determining health status.</field><field name="creator">Chittleborough, Catherine R.</field><field name="description">Measuring socioeconomic position (SEP) in population chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems is essential for monitoring changes in socioeconomic inequities in health over time. A life course approach in epidemiology considers the long-term effects of physical and social exposures during gestation, childhood, adolescence, and later adult life on health. Previous studies provide evidence that socioeconomic factors at different stages of the life course influence current health status. Measures of SEP during early life to supplement existing indicators of current SEP are required to more adequately explain the contribution of socioeconomic factors to health status and monitor health inequities. The aim of this thesis was to examine how a life course perspective could enhance the monitoring of SEP in chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems. The thesis reviewed indicators of early life SEP used in previous research, determined indicators of early life SEP that may be useful in South Australian surveillance systems, and examined the association of SEP over the life course and self-rated health in adulthood across different population groups to demonstrate that inclusion of indicators of early life SEP in surveillance systems could allow health inequities to be monitored among socially mobile and stable groups. A variety of indicators, such as parents&#8217; education level and occupation, and financial circumstances and living conditions during childhood, have been used in different study designs in many countries. Indicators of early life SEP used to monitor trends in the health and SEP of populations over time, and to analyse long-term effects of policies on the changing health of populations, need to be feasible to measure retrospectively, and relevant to the historical, geographical and sociocultural context in which the surveillance system is operating. Retrospective recall of various indicators of early life SEP was examined in a telephone survey of a representative South Australian sample of adults. The highest proportions of missing data were observed for maternal grandfather&#8217;s occupation, and mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s highest education level. Family structure, housing tenure, and family financial situation when the respondent was aged ten, and mother and father&#8217;s main occupation had lower item non-response. Respondents with missing data on early life SEP indicators were disadvantaged in terms of current SEP compared to those who provided this information. The differential response to early life SEP questions according to current circumstances has implications for chronic disease surveillance examining the life course impact of socioeconomic disadvantage. While face-to-face surveys are considered the gold standard of interviewing techniques, computer-assisted telephone interviewing is often preferred for cost and convenience. Recall of father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s highest education level in the telephone survey was compared to that obtained in a face-to-face interview survey. The proportion of respondents who provided information about their father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s highest education level was significantly higher in the face-to-face interview than in the telephone interview. Survey mode, however, did not influence the finding that respondents with missing data for parents&#8217; education were more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. Alternative indicators of early life SEP, such as material and financial circumstances, are likely to be more appropriate than parents&#8217; education for life course analyses of health inequities using surveillance data. Questions about family financial situation and housing tenure during childhood and adulthood asked in the cross-sectional telephone survey were used to examine the association of SEP over the life course with self-rated health in adulthood. Disadvantaged SEP during both childhood and adulthood and upward social mobility in financial situation were associated with a reduced prevalence of excellent or very good health, although this relationship varied across gender, rurality, and country of birth groups. Trend data from a chronic disease and risk factor surveillance system indicated that socioeconomic disadvantage in adulthood was associated with poorer self-rated health. The surveillance system, however, does not currently contain any measures of early life SEP. Overlaying the social mobility variables on the surveillance data indicated how inequities in health could be differentiated in greater detail if early life SEP was measured in addition to current SEP. Inclusion of life course SEP measures in surveillance will enable monitoring of health inequities trends among socially mobile and stable groups. Life course measures are an innovative way to supplement other SEP indicators in surveillance systems. Considerable information can be gained with the addition of a few questions. This will provide further insight into the determinants of health and illness and enable improved monitoring of the effects of policies and interventions on health inequities and intergenerational disadvantage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surveillance; Life course epidemiology; Self-rated health; Socioeconomic position; Population survey; Health inequities</field><field name="subject">Health surveys South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Health status indicators South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Social status Health aspects South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Public health Social aspects South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53358</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancing the nutrition of juvenile spiny lobster, jasus edwardsii, in aquaculture.</field><field name="creator">Simon, Cedric Johan</field><field name="description">The development of cost-effective culture systems such as sea-cages and nutritionally adequate formulated diets for juveniles is of major importance to the advance of commercial spiny lobster aquaculture. Formulated diets have the potential to improve production performance, but to date fresh mussels have consistently produced better growth than formulated diets in spiny lobsters. Reduced food consumption due to the poor attractiveness of formulated diets has been suggested as one of the reasons for the slow growth. Whether gut physiology, processing and digestion could also impair consumption on formulated diets remains to be investigated. Diet digestibility, in particular the digestion of carbohydrates included in formulated diets, is one particular area that needs further research. The objective of this thesis was to make some significant advances in addressing two major bottlenecks (i.e., rearing system and nutrition) currently constraining the commercial ongrowing of J. edwardsii juveniles. Key findings were the following: Sea-cage culture systems of the right design can provide significant growth advantages over tank culture systems, especially on formulated diets, by addressing some of the dietary inadequacies via supplemental nutrition from biofouling; food consumption on formulated diets is significantly constrained in J. edwardsii juveniles because gut throughput is reduced due to a small foregut capacity (2.5-3%), expansion of the baseline dry formulated diet after ingestion, and slow rates of foregut filling (1-2 h), foregut evacuation (10 h), faecal throughput (&gt;34 h) and appetite revival on the formulated diet (&gt;18 h); an intensified intracellular digestion of the formulated diet in the digestive gland may be responsible for the lengthy appetite revival; improving the digestibility of formulated diets appears to be essential to maximise the amount of nutrient assimilated per meal in J. edwardsii; diet digestibility can be improved significantly by decreasing the starch inclusion level and selecting particularly digestible carbohydrate sources for energy (i.e., dextrin, cooked starch, glycogen, and native wheat starch) and feed binder (i.e., carboxymethyl cellulose). Among the digestible carbohydrate sources identified, native wheat starch and carboxymethyl cellulose appears to be best utilised by J. edwardsii juveniles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SPRASA, a novel protein: an investigation into the expression profile, evolutionary conservation and the association with infertility</field><field name="creator">Prendergast, Deborah</field><field name="description">SPRASA (SPACA3, SLLP1) is a newly identified protein that belongs to the lysozyme super family.

Antibodies reactive with SPRASA have been identified in some infertile men and an antiserum reactive with recombinant SPRASA prevented human sperm binding to hamster oocytes in vitro, indicating an important role in sperm oocyte recognition. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of SPRASA in human infertility. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of SPRASA in the testes, however, in contrast to previous reports, SPRASA expression was also identified in the ovaries and heart of both males and females. In silico analysis identified two putative promoter regions within the SPRASA gene. As expected, the first promoter is located 5&#8217; to exon one, while the second promoter is located 5&#8217; to exon two. Further investigations by luciferase promoter constructs identified that both promoters were capable of supporting transcriptional activity, however promoter 2 was the more effective promoter. Mutation screening of 102 infertile and 104 fertile couples identified three variants in SPRASA. Orthologue sequence analysis indicates that SPRASA is a mammalian-only gene. This is similar to another member of the lysozyme family, alpha-lactalbumin. However, unlike alpha-lactalbumin, which expresses one variant in all mammals, the SPRASA gene&#8217;s organisation in humans and simians is different to that found in prosimians and non-primates. This suggests that SPRASA has a unique function in simians compared to other mammals. Amino acid sequence alignment of the SPRASA orthologues revealed a unique motif that is not seen in other lysozyme family members. Computer modelling showed that this SPRASA motif is located in a region analogous to the substrate binding region of c-type lysozyme/alpha-lactalbumin. In conclusion, SPRASA appears to have a role in both male and female fertility and may be important in species-specific differences in mammalian fertilisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5826</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrusion of Miocene dikes into wet tephra, Kaipara Harbour, Northland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Godinot, Antoine</field><field name="description">Several subvertical dikes of quenched and chilled basalt intrude a submarine tephra and underlying Miocene sediments on the north shore of Okahukura peninsula, Kaipara harbour, west coast of Northland, New Zealand. Results of simple physical modelling show that a number of structures, complex at first sight, i.e. rim dikes and horns, fingers, sigmoidal and rhomboidal intrusives ( the three latter named internal intrusives ) and peperites form in sequence when the dikes stop and cool. Rim dikes and horns are formed at an early stage as dike tips are blunted as a result of consolidation of tephra when the pore water pressure dissipates. Internal intrusives and at last peperite are interpreted as volume of expelled magma consecutively to the change from liquid to the more voluminous solid+gas states of the magma as the dikes cool. The tips of the dikes act as a pressure valve because, in such sheet intrusion, an increase in the internal pressure is magnified some thirty times at the tip. After the dikes had solidified, the tephra ahead of dike tip was fluidized by vapor flow. Two dikes intruding the tephra are selected for mechanical modelling. Preliminary results show that the tephra was not cemented. It is modelled as a sand with a hyperbolic stress vs strain relationship which changes with the stress path. The dikes are treated as flat elliptical cavities. It is shown that the presence of an array of cracks in the tephra ahead of the dikes can be simulated with the Barenblatt-Dugdale model of fracture mechanics and that the width of the elliptical slit used in calculation must be wider than that of the dikes. The driving pressure of these two dikes was approximately 4 MPa and elastic displacement 25 to 30 % of total displacement. The tephra is the remnant of a dissected but structurally intact shallow submarine volcano of surtseyan type. Results of the mechanical modelling and structural and sedimentological data enable to localise the main vent of the volcano. The surtseyan cone, which consists of tholeiite, overlies unconformably all other Tertiary formations. This confirms that, along the west coast of Northland, the latest lower Miocene manifestation of high alumina volcanism occurred in Mid-Upper Altonian times ( 17.5-15.5 My ) and was basic and tholeiitic.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5872</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure of the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal field (New Zealand) based on interpretation of seismic and gravity data</field><field name="creator">Henrys, S.(Stuart)</field><field name="description">The structure of the Broadlands-Ohaaki hot water geothermal field has been studied by analysis of seismic and gravity data. The 1984 seismic survey provided 26 km of multifold (12-fold) reflection data and refraction data (up to 1 km) along 6 profiles in the vicinity of the geothermal field. Test data were acquired along 2 profiles of 1 km length and included a walk-away noise spread. An attempt was also made to record shear-waves (SV) along one profile with in-line horizontal geophones. Processing of reflection data indicated the importance of static corrections, velocity filtering and spectral balancing of the trace amplitude spectrum before deconvolution. Delay times from the analysis of refracted (first) arrivals outline areas of anomalous low velocity that coincide with areas of highest surface temperatures (&gt;50&#176;C at 15 m depth). Ray trace modelling of travel times near the Ohaaki Pool delineate an anomalously low-velocity zone to a depth of 200 m. The frequency and amplitude of the recorded signals near the Ohaaki Pool are attenuated in comparison to field records from outside areas with high surface temperatures. Converted shear-waves indicate that Poisson's ratio is low (0.17 to 0.20) in this area. These effects are consistent with a steam/water zone occurring close to the surface Common-mid-point derived velocities and ray-tracing inversion of reflecting horizons were used to determine the 3-dimensional velocity distribution beneath the geothermal field. A low-velocity zone, in which velocities are 10-20% lower inside the geothermal field, coincides with the region of highest signal attenuation (Q&lt;20), the productive borefield, and the region of highest fluid temperature (&gt;250&#176;C at 1000 m depth) The seismic stratigraphy of the volcanic units was established using drill hole data and synthetic seismograms. The top and bottom of the Ohaaki Rhyolite and Broadlands Dacite account for the major reflecting horizons with occasional less strong reflections from the top of the Rangitaiki Ignimbrite. However, even strong reflectors are not coherent across any single section and the top of the rhyolite and dacite flows may show up with strong reflections at one part of the profile, but elsewhere with weak or no reflections. The limited success in enhancing signal quality below 500-700 m depth is attributed to a combination of noise generated in the 1ow velocity surface layer and the complexity of the geological structure at depth. Analysis of noise characteristics of the Broadlands-Ohaaki reflection data included computation of synthetic seismograms and spectral analysis of recorded seismograms. Theoretical modelling of near-surface structures showed that prominent low-frequency noise trains observed in field data are due to waves trapped in the surface layer that are excited by direct waves from shallow (5-10 m) shots. A very rapid increase in seismic wavespeed occurs at the water table and causes the surface layer to act as a waveguide which traps low-frequency Rayleigh waves and air-coupled Rayleigh waves visible on near offset traces. Compressional energy is also efficiently converted into shear-waves (SV) and is dominant as reverberating reflected refracted energy at far offsets (&gt;400 m). In addition, there is resonant coupling between the surface waves and multiple reflections. Surface-consistent spectral analysis indicates that variation in receiver response is a function of the thickness of the low-velocity layer. Reinterpretation of refraction data (1968 survey) by ray-trace modelling elucidated new structural and stratigraphic details which tie in with well data and confirms the velocity structure established from reflection data. Near offset refracted arrivals clearly define the top of the Ohaaki Rhyolite (2200-2800 m/sec) in the western part of the field and the top of the Broadlands Dacite (2650-3200 m/sec) in the east. Longer offset (&gt;3 km) travel times could be modelled as arrivals from the top of the Rautawiri Breccia and Rangitaiki Ignimbrite (velocities between 2800 m/sec and 3800 m/sec). Arrivals from greywacke basement (4500 m/sec) could only be detected in the east outside the geothermal field coming from depths less than 1.0 km. A 3-dimensional interpretation of residual gravity anomalies was also attempted since the seismic sections and detailed well data provide strong constraints. Isodensity and isoporosity contours of the Rautawiri Breccia, Waiora Formation and the Ohaaki Rhyolite reveal areas of high density and 1ow porosity corresponding to the productive regions of the borefield. This density increase is caused by alteration and mineralisation. The detailed interpretation models allow the construction of basement contour and isopach maps. Basement structural-contours show that the basement surface is very complex with significant vertical displacement along a series of predominantly northwest-southeast trending normal faults of limited horizontal extent and with no evidence of significant cross faulting. The basement reaches a maximum depth of 2300 m b.s.l west of the geothermal field. East of the geothermal field the basement rises along a series of northeast-southwest trending normal faults including the Kaingaroa Fault. Isopachs of the producive Rautawiri Breccia and Waiora Formation indicate that the thickest sequence of these units lies to the north and south of the geothermal field apart from at least two structurally controlled depressions inside the field where the thickness of the Rautawiri Breccia is greater than 500 m. Elsewhere, the combined total thickness of these units is less than 400 m. The Broadlands Dacite dome extends over an area of about 16 km2. A magnetic high associated with the Broadlands Dacite is caused by the unaltered, normally magnetised dacite east of the resistivity boundary. Isopachs of the Ohaaki Rhyolite indicate that its thickness increases to the northwest. This finding cannot be reconciled with an earlier concept of a localised Ohaaki dome structure which required a localised feeder dyke within the field. The Ohaaki Rhyolite is probably part of a more extensive chain of rhyolites outcropping to the north and west.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5873</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics and ecology of northern Hauraki Gulf Bryozoa</field><field name="creator">Whitten, Ronald Francis.</field><field name="description">The bryozoan faunas of 104 sediment grab samples and 29 shore and shallow water collections from the northern Hauraki Gulf are described and illustrated. 175 species and subspecies are recognised, 23 of which are described as new and a further 8 recognised as new but not formally described owing to their poor state of preservation.

The Anascina is subdivided into superfamilies based largely on the 'Divisions' of previous authors. The main environmental factors in the northern Hauraki Gulf are summarised and their effect on the bryozoan fauna discussed. The substrate preferences of some species are recognised. The distribution and diversity patterns of the bryozoan fauna are examined, the greatest numbers and highest diversities being in the coarse sediments, the faunas of the fine sands and muds being sparse. The eschariform and vinculariiform growth types are redefined and the assemblages analysed in terms of zoarial form. Differences from some previous investigations of bryozoan growth form distributions are the absence of reteporiform species from shallow water, and the presence in shallow water of vinculariiform species in which the outer walls have been strengthened by secondary calcification or the branches are anastomosing. A brief discussion is given on the use of Bryozoa in palaeoenvironmental analysis in the light of this and previous studies on bryozoan distribution.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5874</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology and landslides of the eastern Te Aute district, southern Hawkes Bay</field><field name="creator">Pettinga, Jarg Rein.</field><field name="description">A succession of Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary sedimentary strata of the East Coast Deformed Belt is subdivided into 12 formations. Three unconformities and two stratigraphic breaks of uncertain character are recognised. Upper Cretaceous sedimentation is typified by an influx of clastic detritus. A progressive fining upward sequence is represented by Paleocene and Eocene formations. Total stratigraphic thickness is small, reflecting a tectonically quiescent period and environment of deposition which was probably deepwater, continental slope. The East Coast Deformed Belt, a tectonically active and structurally complex zone since Oligocene times is interpreted as the accretionary sediment prism in the arc-trench gap of the obliquely convergent plate margin. The Waimarama-Mangakuri Coastal High and Elsthorpe Anticline are located over a deep-seated thrust zone. Both are characterised by complexly folded and thrust-faulted Upper Cretaceous to Miocene sequences. Thrusts commonly are accompanied by m&#233;lange and crush zones. The 'coastal high' developed during Upper Oligocene and Miocene times. The Elsthorpe Anticline formed as an offshoot from this during Upper Pliocene-Lower Pleistocene times. Deformation has occurred progressively since Oligocene times. A sporadically preserved early phase, recognised in east-west trending structures and inverted sequences, followed by imbricate thrust faulting along the dominant northeast-southwest structural grain are present within the 'coastal high'. The narrow elongate thrust zones are separated by broad, shallow synclinal basins in which thick flysch sequences accumulated unconformably on older strata during Neogene times. These basin sequences have, in part, subsequently been incorporated into the imbricate accretionary margin. Little evidence exists to suggest that major transcurrent faulting has been important in coastal Southern Hawkes Bay. Mount Kahuranaki, a limestone klippe, is located to the east of a change in axial trend of the Elsthorpe Anticline, and is genetically related to this. It formed as the result of a gravity glide from the anticlinal crest onto the eastern flank. A large-scale Regional-Slump which developed during Quaternary time involves the progressive eastward downfaulting and rotation of large blocks of land extending over 20 km in length, incorporating much of the Waimarama-Mangakuri Coastal High. Only the head of the slump is exposed onland. Its extent offshore to the east is unknown. Large 'parasitic' landslides involve the crown of the western (main scarp) margin of the slump. Soft rock lithologies encountered are typical of the Belt, and with bedrock structure are important controlling factors on slope failure. The main associations recognised between failure type, lithology and structure are: a) Earthflows, debris-flow slides, mudflows, and creep on Upper Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary alternating sandstone and carbonaceous mudstone, glauconitic sandstone and bentonitic mudstone. Complex folding, intense fracturing, shearing and development of crush or m&#233;lange zones on thrust faults has reduced much o f the soft rock to 'soil'. b) Rotational slide-earthflow, regolith slides, clayflows on massive mudstones and thinly bedded mudstones-sandstones of Middle Tertiary age. These sequences are tightly folded and thrust faulted. c) Large planar slides (block and wedge glides) occur in a Middle to Upper Miocene flysch succession which is gently folded and moderately faulted. The slides occur on bedding planes in conjunction with steeply dipping primary fractures. d) Sheet and regolith slides are widespread irrespective of lithology. Important controls on precipitation and near-surface groundwater conditions are exerted by the moderate to steep relief and the limestone-capped Maraetotara Plateau. Permeability contrasts both within bedrock and soil masses are recognised as primary factors influencing slope failure. Severe earthquakes and regional uplift are common and widespread in the tectonically active East Coast Deformed Belt (eg Napier, 1931). Lowering o f base levels in conjunction with regional (tectonic) uplift is related to successive generations of slope failures. Landslides belong to an old (relict) or a new (rejuvenated) landscape, each of which is composed of several erosion surfaces. Slope failure susceptibility is assessed in terms of bedrock and soil failures. Five critical control parameters (based on landform and bedrock characteristics) are given susceptibility ratings, which are related to a rating scale of slope failure susceptibility.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5875</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising Basic Film Festival Operation :an Open System Paradigm</field><field name="creator">Fischer, Alex</field><field name="description">This study proposes that aspects primary to film festival operation be identified and logically linked through established system-based theories.

People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AC/DC : a study in art, gender and  popular culture : an exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Syme, Gemma</field><field name="description">This thesis began as an artistic investigation into the politics of identity and sex/sexuality. The main ideas that run throughout this exegesis position themselves within Nicolas Bourriaud&#8217;s ideas in the book Postproduction, and also around a parafeminist ideology. Within this I focus on popular music culture, the body, video and performance art, and visual representations of the body. I pay particular attention to the female body, and look into ideas of conventional social norms and how people challenge these. I look into the work of several female artists who deal with the visual representation, and also look at figures within popular music culture. Within band culture I look into how the band can be used as a vehicle to disseminate ideas wider audience. Art and music culture have fed off of each other for generations and can provide valuable strategies within each context for thinking beyond social norms. The remix can be used as a tactic to decode forms and narratives in popular culture. This can be used to investigate representations of identity within a space that is in a constant state of flux. This is particularly useful as a parafeminist strategy because it allows a context in which to question, rather than answer. As a result of this study I have found that there are no concrete answers when it comes to identity and sexuality, but can conclude that conventional gender representations and signifiers of identity can be remixed into different scenarios and narratives that can challenge social norms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">representations of the body</field><field name="subject">female artists</field><field name="subject">band culture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">parafeminism</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410199 Performing arts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/947</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the acidic protein fraction of bovine whey and its effect on bone cells : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, New Zealand EMBARGOED till 1 December 2015</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Bernadette Jane</field><field name="description">Milk is provided to new borns as their first food source and it contains essential nutrients, vitamins and other beneficial components, such as enzymes and antibodies that are required for rapid growth and development of the new born and for sustained growth over time. Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multicultural encounters in music therapy in New Zealand : What particular clinical experiences do NZ music therapists describe when encountering clients who identify closely with a culture different from their own? : research dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music Therapy at the New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Choi, Hee-Chan</field><field name="description">This qualitative study investigates how music therapists work within a culturally diverse environment in New Zealand and the researcher's own growing experience as a student clinician.

It is a commercially important species in New Zealand because of its exquisite taste that attracts premium prices. This thesis describes the first isolation and partial charcterisation of an oyster haemolymph calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding protein. This protein 'chiletin' was originally isolated from oyster haemolymph by binding to the agarose-galactan matrix of a Sepharose column. Chiletin was predominantly composed of a 24 kilodalton (kDa) band when examined with one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions and a 12 kDa band with reduction of disulphide bonds. The N-terminal sequence of the 24 kDa band was determined to be 'IAGPGWEKYN'. This sequence was not homologous to any known protein. Examination of isolated chiletin with two-dimensional protein analysis gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of three (~12 kDa) subunits ranging in isoelectric point from 5.2 to 6.0. The 24 kDa protein was used to immunise rabbits and a separate antiserum was also raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide (identical to that above) coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin. These antisera were used to confirm the size of the chiletin subunits with Western blots and to examine the elution of chiletin in oyster haemolymph with size exclusion chromatography in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 8 M urea. There were four or five different sized conformational aggregates of chiletin present in oyster haemolymph under physiological conditions (PBS). The use of 8 M urea produced two separate aggregates. A major characteristic of lectins is the ability to agglutinate sheep red blood cells and both whole oyster haemolymph and isolated chiletin had this property. Chiletin was identified by immunohistochemistry to be present in a number of tissues. Staining intensity was most consistent in the auricular myocardial cells, followed by the digestive gland epithelium. Chiletin was not induced in haemolymph in response to temperature (30??C) stress or injection of turpentine into the adductor muscle. There have been few immunological studies performed with O. chilensis. The results of the project contribute to what is known about comparative immunology. Greater understanding of how oysters respond to stress and deal with pathogens will ultimately be of benefit to the aquaculture industry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein analysis</field><field name="subject">Oyster structure</field><field name="subject">Oyster immunology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300504 Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1495</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolism of selenium in cats and dogs : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physiology and Nutrition at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Todd, Sarah Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The main objective of this PhD was to provide fundamental information regarding some metabolic aspects of selenium metabolism in cats and dogs.

The use of blood parameters for the assessment of selenium status was investigated in a study in which cats were fed inorganic and organic selenium supplemented at concentrations of up to 2.0 &#181;g Se/g DM for 32 days. Plasma selenium concentrations reflected dietary selenium intakes, however there were no differences between the different levels of supplementation. Whole blood selenium concentrations showed less distinct patterns and were thought to be a more useful indicator of longer term selenium status. Activities of glutathione peroxidase in plasma and whole blood showed no response and the response of cats to supplementation of the different forms of selenium were similar. In the same study, faecal and urinary excretion (&#181;g/kg BW/d) were measured and apparent absorption and retention were estimated during the last seven days of the 32 day trial. Faecal excretion of selenium remained constant whereas urinary excretion of selenium increased with increased dietary intake. The form of selenium had no effect on excretion or apparent absorption however there was a trend in which more selenium was retained in cats fed organic selenium. A study was conducted with cats and dogs fed high levels (10 &#181;g Se/g DM) of inorganic and organic selenium for 21 days to determine whether there were species differences in their metabolic response. Cats and dogs exhibited the same pattern of response, however cats showed higher plasma selenium levels, lower levels in liver and excreted more selenium compared to dogs. It was concluded from this data that cats and dogs differ in their metabolism of selenium. The effect of heat processing on the addition of inorganic and organic selenium to petfoods was investigated in cats fed 3.0 &#181;g Se/g DM for 11 days. Apparent absorption was higher in cats fed inorganic selenium added after processing, whilst less selenium of organic origin was excreted in the urine when added after processing. These preliminary results suggest heat processing may decrease the apparent availability and utilisation of selenium in petfoods.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pet food analysis</field><field name="subject">Selenium absorption</field><field name="subject">Heat processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300505 Anatomy and physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1496</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pneumonia and pleurisy in sheep : studies of prevalence, risk factors, vaccine efficacy and economic impact : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Goodwin-Ray, Kathryn Anne</field><field name="description">The objectives of this thesis were to investigate patterns of lamb pneumonia prevalence of a large sample of New Zealand flocks including an investigation of spatial patterns, to evaluate farm-level risk factors for lamb pneumonia, to determine the efficacy of a commercially available vaccine for the disease and to estimate the likely cost of lamb pneumonia and pleurisy for New Zealand sheep farmers. Data were collected by ASURE NZ Ltd. meat inspectors at processing plants in Canterbury, Manawatu and Gisborne between December 2000 and September 2001. All lambs processed at these plants were scored for pneumonia (scores: 0, &lt;10% or &#8805;10% lung surface area affected) involving 1,899,556 lambs from 1,719 farms. Pneumonia prevalence was evaluated for spatial patterns at farm level and for hierarchical patterns at lamb, mob and farm levels (Chapter 3). The average pneumonia prevalence in Canterbury, Feilding and Gisborne was 34.2%, 19.1% and 21.4% respectively. Odds ratios of lambs slaughtered between March and May were vastly higher than those slaughtered in other months indicating longer growth periods due to pneumonia. Since pneumonia scores were more variable between mobs within a flock than between flocks, it was concluded that pneumonia scores were poor indicators for the flock pneumonia level due to their lack of repeatability. There was no statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in pneumonia prevalence for any region, hence lamb pneumonia appeared to be largely independent of topographical and geo-climatic factors. A questionnaire-based case-control study was conducted investigating farm-level factors from a sample of farms with either high (case) or zero (control) pneumonia prevalence at slaughter (Chapter 4). Significant risk factors for case farms were: (1) shearing lambs on the day of weaning, (2) breeding ewe replacements on-farm (3) number of lambs sold (an indicator of flock size) and (4) increased percentage of lambs sold late in the season (March to May). Significant protective factors included: (1) set stocking lambs after weaning, (2) injecting lambs with Vitamin B12 at the time of tailing, (3) injecting lambs with Vitamin B12 at weaning. In Canterbury, flocks with Romney ewes and other ewes had a higher risk of pneumonia than those with fine wool type ewes (Merinos, Corriedales or Halfbreds). In a clinical trial, 8,364 lambs from seven commercial sheep farms with a history of lamb pneumonia were vaccinated with Ovipast Plus&#174; or placebo by systematic random allocation within mob and farm. An assessment of the extent of pneumonic lesions was conducted at slaughter and lamb growth rate was monitored through the growth period (Chapter 5). The vaccination trial showed no statistically significant effect of Ovipast&#174; vaccination on the extent of lung lesions at slaughter or ADG of lambs from the first treatment until slaughter. No significant differences were found between isolation rates of Pasteurella spp and patho-histological classifications from pneumonic lung samples of placebo and vaccinated lambs. A spreadsheet-based stochastic model was constructed to estimate the cost of lamb pneumonia and pleurisy to New Zealand farmers. The estimate was based on data of the effect of pneumonia on lamb growth rate, distributions of pneumonia severity, prevalence of moderate to severe pneumonia (&#8805;10% lung surface area) and pleurisy prevalence (Chapter 6). The simulated annual average cost of pneumonia was NZ $28.1 million and that of pleurisy NZ $25.1 million. The combined cost of pneumonia and pleurisy to New Zealand farmers had an average of NZ $53.2 million (95% stochastic interval = $32.4-$78.9 million), or US $31.9 million per annum. This would equate to NZ $2.32 per lamb. In comparison, animal health, shearing expenses and feed expenses cost NZ $2.37, $2.62 and $1.85 per lamb, respectively. This research has demonstrated sub-clinical pneumonia to be a widespread disease in the New Zealand sheep farming population while previous research has focussed on case studies of affected farms. The estimated costs of pneumonia and pleurisy to New Zealand farmers ($53.2 million) highlight the financial effects of these diseases and the need for further research. We also found that the commercially available vaccine could neither prevent sub-clinical effects (lamb growth rate) nor clinical manifestations (pneumonic lung lesions) of lamb pneumonia. The case-control study has revealed farm-level factors which, in the absence of effective vaccines, indicated management practices that farmers might perceive as opportunities to control lamb pneumonia. However, it is advisable to evaluate the efficiency of such management changes. Pneumonia is aetiologically complex disease involving the interplay of many environmental, host and pathogen factors. It is also a difficult disease to study in the absence of diagnostic tests in live animals. However, further research should focus on the development of management changes until effective vaccines are available. A starting point for this research would be to evaluate the impact of such management changes in reducing the incidence of lamb pneumonia. More specifically, the roles of stress during crowding of lambs for extended periods warrants further investigation. The development of efficient vaccines requires an analysis of pathogens, especially Pasteurella (Mannheimia) haemolytica and Mycoplasma species, the sources of infection, their strain diversity and transmission dynamics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pneumonia in lambs</field><field name="subject">Sheep diseases</field><field name="subject">Etiology of pneumonia</field><field name="subject">Lamb management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1497</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure, composition and degradation of the cell walls of forage chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) leaves : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nutritional Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sun, Xuezhao</field><field name="description">Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), a valuable forage for ruminant livestock in temperate regions, appears highly degradable in the rumen. Fundamental reasons for the rapid breakdown of chicory cell walls in the rumen were studied. Cell walls were isolated from laminae and midribs of chicory (cv. Grasslands Puna II) leaves. The walls, which, except for the walls of xylem tracheary elements in vascular bundles, were non-lignified, were fractionated progressively with 50 mM CDTA, 50 mM Na2CO3, 1 M KOH, 4 M KOH, 4 M KOH + 3.5% H3BO3, and hot water. The polysaccharides were similar to those in nonlignified walls of other dicotyledons, but with high proportions of pectic polysaccharides (67% of the total wall polysaccharides in the laminae). These included homogalacturonans (HGs, 50% of the total wall polysaccharides in laminae) and rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I). In contrast, the proportions of cellulose, xyloglucans, heteroxylans and glucomannans were low. The locations of different pectic polysaccharides were determined using the monoclonal antibodies JIM5 and JIM7 against HGs with low and high degrees of methyl esterification, respectively, LM6 against arabinan and LM5 against galactan. All primary walls were labelled with all the antibodies used. However, the middle lamella, tricellular junctions and the corners of intercellular spaces were labelled with JIM5 and JIM7, but not with LM5. The middle lamella was labelled with LM6, but not the corners of intercellular spaces. These results support the involvement in cell adhesion of HGs with low degrees of methyl esterification. A preparation of endopolygalacturonase (endo-PG) was used to investigate cell adhesion, and its effect on forage particle breakdown was determined using weight loss, chemical analysis and immunofluorescence labelling. The preparation dramatically reduced particle size. Cell separation was accompanied by a loss of HGs with low degrees of methyl esterifcation from the middle lamella and corners of intercellular spaces. A consequential loss of cell adhesion evidently caused leaf breakdown. The degradation of fresh chicory leaves by rumen bacteria was investigated by measuring weight loss, monosaccharide release and immunocytolabelling. Two bacteria, the pectolytic Lachnospira multiparus D32 and the cellulolytic Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, effectively degraded chicory. Pectic polysaccharides were degraded faster than other wall polysaccharides, with uronic acid released faster and more completely than neutral monosaccharides. The preponderance of non-lignified primary walls and abundance of pectic polysaccharides may account, in part, for the rapid degradation of forage chicory in the rumen. The HGs in the middle lamellae and corners of intercellular spaces probably have a role in cell adhesion, and their degradation is probably responsible for the rapid reduction in the particle size of chicory leaves in the rumen.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cichorium intybus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300201 Plant biochemistry and physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1498</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ancient DNA studies of the New Zealand kiwi and wattlebirds : evolution, conservation and culture : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular BioSciences at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Lara Dawn</field><field name="description">Following content removed due to copyright restrictions:  Lambert, D.

This thesis describes the design and synthesis of libraries of ketones and &#947;-lactones that will be evaluated for flavour potential. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), the Fox, and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) were used throughout this study. Ketones were synthesised individually via a two-step sequence: a Grignard reaction followed by the oxidation of the resulting alcohol in Chapter 2. Some compounds selected from the Fox analysis were assessed by GC-O. The analysis gave promising results for aromatic and cyclopropyl ketones and a library of cyclopropyl ketones was prepared. Individual racemic lactones were synthesised via a two-step sequence: the Linstead modification of the Knoevenagel reaction and subsequent lactonisation in Chapter 3. Libraries of racemic &#947;-lactones (C8-C12), including &#945;-substituted &#947;-lactones, were produced combinatorially. Further, synthesis of a library of &#947;-thionolactones was achieved by treatment of a library of &#947;-lactones with Lawesson's reagent. The libraries were analysed by GC-O. A (R)-dodecalactone was synthesised from L-glutamic acid and the (S)-enantiomer was synthesised by the same sequence from D-glutamic acid in Chapter 4. Asymmetric syntheses of both enantiomeric series of &#947;-lactones utilizing the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction was employed to give the libraries in Chapter 5. Libraries of a-substituted and &#946;-substituted &#947;-lactones were synthesised combinatorially and analysed by GC-O.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dairy products</field><field name="subject">Ketones</field><field name="subject">Lactones</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1500</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent medical device integration with real time operating system : a thesis submitted to the School of Engineering in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering, Department of Electronics and Computer Syetem [i.e. Systems] Engineering at Massey University, [Albany], New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jan, Zaid</field><field name="description">Many commercial devices now being produced have the ability to be remotely monitored and controlled.

The hardware to be used in the development of this platform is an ARM Cortex M3 based Micro-Controller board which has to be designed to meet the requirement set by the Precept Health the founder of this platform. The design was conducted at Massey University in collaboration with senior engineer from the company. The main task in achieving the aim was the development of the necessary software layers to implement remote monitoring and control. The eCosCentric real-time embedded operating system was used to form a generic base for developing applications to monitor and control specific devices. The majority of the work involved in this project was the deployment of the operating system to the Micro-Controller. During the development process, several hardware issues were discovered with the Ethernet interface and were corrected. Using the generic platform, an application was developed to allow the reading of Bi-Directional pass through a communication protocol from 4 isolated serial input channels, to an Ethernet channel using TCP protocol.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote monitoring</field><field name="subject">Operating system</field><field name="subject">TCP protocol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280304 Operating systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1501</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring processing reflection methods and how they can be utilized in music therapy sessions at an adolescent acute psychiatric ward : a research project presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Music Therapy at the New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Garber, Melissa Lee</field><field name="description">This study explores how other music therapists and mental health professionals process and reflect on their sessions and what issues are relevant and instrumental in achieving this. The primary focus is on an acute psychiatric ward for adolescents. The intent is to improve my ability to process and reflect on my clients&#8217; responses and actions during and after future Music Therapy sessions. Research began by exploring the various ways of processing content that emerge during sessions by exploring the literature, interviewing an Occupational Therapist and a Clinical Psychiatrist from the unit and by analysing my reflective journal. Using multiple sources of information, methods, techniques and theories I will endeavour to uncover meaning, improve my understanding and thus improve my future practice. The initial perspective was endeavouring to discover how a therapist can better reflect on or process their sessions. Findings showed that the therapist processing with intent to &#8220;fix&#8221; or &#8220;cure&#8221; a client is misdirected.  Through self-reflection, observation, &#8216;mindfulness&#8217; , empathy, awareness of countertransference and several other tools, a therapist is able to become client-centred and potentially assist the client to self-reflect and develop mindfulness.  The way in which a therapist processes and reflects is often influenced by an underlying psychodynamic theory that they adhere to.  Experience and training can also influence this processing.  With this client group, it is difficult to fully comprehend what a client is feeling or thinking.  A therapist best serves the client by initially focusing on the client-therapist relationship.  By building a trusting, safe environment, meeting the clients where they are emotionally or physically and by making exercises meaningful, clients needs can begin to be met.  This all contributes to the ultimate goal of the therapy at this unit - to help clients &#8220;gain skills, gain independence and gain wellness&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music therapy practice</field><field name="subject">Client-centred therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1502</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robotic haptics : retrofitting a pick and place manipulation arm to haptic input device : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a degree of Master of Engineering, Mechatronics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">De Lautour, Courtney C.</field><field name="description">Robotic haptics has been and continues to be an area of intense research, primarily in medical and exploration industries. This is due to an ability to provide high data throughput between human and machine. In medical applications, it is possible to detect and compensate errors such as a hand tremor in a surgeon. It is possible to apply scaling factors to assist in microsurgery situations, and can allow leading experts to perform procedures from anywhere on the globe. As part of a collaboration to develop a robotic method of femur fracture realignment between Auckland University, Auckland District Health Board, and Massey University, the project seeks to provide a haptic driven HMI for the realignment system. To reduce construction required, an existing manipulation arm (Mitsubishi RV-M1) is used as the hardware interface device. A new motor controller is designed to provide additional functionality as the standard controller provides no force control or real-time feedback of position. A software interface is developed (using version 3 of the C# programming language, developed by Microsoft, and version 3.5 of the Microsoft .NET Framework) with the ultimate specification of becoming being the primary interface platform for the realignment system. The interface has been implemented to the point of providing a simulated environment for the haptic device. It was found that the configuration of the RV-M1 provides a tight area of high dexterity as a haptic device, and as such, similar kinematic configurations are poor candidates for practical implementation. The implication of which, is that a new manipulator should be designed which grants a larger volume of high dexterity space.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robotics in medicine</field><field name="subject">Robotic manipulator</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290300 Manufacturing Engineering::290301 Robotics and mechatronics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1503</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secular cooling of the solid Earth, emergence of the continents, and evolution of Earth's external envelopes</field><field name="creator">Flament, Nicolas</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosphy (Cotutelle)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geophysics</field><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6334</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MUNK&#193;CS: A Jewish World That Was</field><field name="creator">Berger, Anna M.</field><field name="description">MA (Research)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MUNK&#193;CS</field><field name="subject">Jews -- Hungary -- History -- 20th Century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6336</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity of maternal care in a community setting: a randomised controlled trial using the Zelen design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research investigated a new community-based model of continuity of care provided collaboratively by a small team of midwives and obstetricians (St George Outreach Maternity Project or STOMP). The study considered whether STOMP improved maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes, resulted in a better experience for women and could be implemented within the current resources of a public teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. A randomised controlled trial using a Zelen design was used to compare the STOMP model with standard care. One thousand and eighty-nine women were randomly allocated to either the STOMP model or standard hospital-based care. The Zelen design was used to increase the participation of women from non-English speaking backgrounds and to reduce disappointment bias in women allocated to the control group.  The results suggest that the model of community-based continuity of care is associated with a lower caesarean section rate, more positive experiences for women and costs less than standard care. There were no differences in the number of medical complications experienced in either group, but more women in the control group were admitted to hospital during the antenatal period. There were four perinatal deaths in each group. Women in the STOMP group reported a higher quality of antenatal care compared with the control group. Women in the STOMP group also reported that the community-based service was accessible and convenient with reduced waiting times for appointments. Women in the STOMP group were more likely to have received adequate information about labour, birth and the postnatal period and felt more 'in control' during labour compared with the control group. Women from both groups reported problems with postnatal care, particularly when provided in the hospital. The study also examined the impact of the STOMP model on women from Chinese and Arabic-speaking backgrounds. The STOMP model appeared to reduce the rate of elective and emergency caesarean section in Chinese-speaking women compared with English-speaking women. Small numbers precluded statistical analysis on these data so the results must be interpreted with caution. Women from Chinese-speaking  backgrounds reported receiving insufficient information. The STOMP model improved the provision of information, however Chinese-speaking women still reported inferior experiences. There were also differences in the method of infant feeding. The results indicate that the model provides effective, cost efficient and satisfying maternity care. New models of maternity care can be implemented within current resources when organisations have a strong commitment to change.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">Maternity services.</field><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">Sydney.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/334</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multi-attribute elimination by aspects (MEBA) model.</field><field name="creator">Pihlens, David A.</field><field name="description">Our research proposes a new, multi-attribute, parameterisation of Tversky&#8217;s Elimination- By-Aspects (EBA) model. The EBA model conceptualises choice as a covert sequential elimination process with choice probabilities formulated over all consideration sets of the choice set. This specification attempts to capture the effect of context on choice behaviour. However, the EBA model has seen limited usage due to the large number of required parameters given the set of items under study. For a set of items T, it has 2|T| - 3 free parameters, which is infeasible for all but the simplest of contexts. To provide a practical operationalisation, we impose a set of a priori constraints on the parameter space. We define a generic multi-attribute structure to the set of aspects. This restricts the cardinality of the set of unknown scale values while retaining the functional (recursive) form of the model. The EBA hypothesis of a population of lexicographic decision-makers can therefore be tested in more market-realistic contexts, and inferences made over a large universal set of items described by the complete factorial. We call this model the Multi-attribute Elimination-By-Aspects (MEBA) model. The MEBA model reduces the set of unknown free parameters to a maximum of |T|-1. We develop a general algebraic expression for the MEBA choice probabilities as a function of the attributes of the options in the choice set. This enables the derivation of a likelihood function, and consequently maximum likelihood estimation. We also consider the form of optimal MEBA paired comparison designs. Using Monte Carlo simulation and a discrete choice experiment with consumers, we conduct an initial empirical test of the model against the special case of the MNL model (that assumes no context effects) and find the MEBA model to be a better approximation of observed choice behaviour. This is achieved on a common set of parameters, and so it is due solely to the difference in functional form of the two models. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions, in particular the introduction of heterogeneity into the model, and the description of optimal choice experiments for larger choice set sizes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling.</field><field name="subject">Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Multiattribute decisions.</field><field name="subject">Consumers' preferences.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/884</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determinants of commercial property market performance.</field><field name="creator">Higgins, David M</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

To improve efficiency and effectiveness, some countries have introduced standardised tests and others have introduced outcome-based approaches which use teacher-conducted assessments as a basis for reporting learners&#8217; progress and achievement against system-wide or national standards. It is particularly worth noting that assessment is currently moving away from the use of standardised multiple-choice tests to more complex performance-based assessments. This paradigm shift has led to changes in assessment approaches from a norm-referenced grading to a criterion-referenced grading. Japan is one of a number of countries that has introduced a criterion-referenced approach to assessment. This research case study investigates a criterion-referenced assessment system implemented in 2004 for English at lower secondary schools in Japan. The study examines the perceptions held by English teachers about the new assessment system, the way the assessment has impacted on their practices and the basis of their decisions about assessing students&#8217; achievement. Data sources include policy documents, teacher questionnaires, interviews with teachers and non-teaching educators, and teaching and assessment materials. These data are examined using a qualitative and interpretive approach. The study focuses on the assessment implementation process itself and on the subsequent changes that need to be further adapted by the teachers as they enact the new policies. It defines the kind of support teachers need in order to practice consistent and valid assessment. The conclusions from the study support the findings of other similar studies and suggest that changing one component on its own can not bring about a change. The findings suggest that it is important that a proposed innovation ensures the harmonious relationship amongst key components such as curriculum/syllabus, teaching materials, and examinations, and is grounded in local experience and educational realities in order to prevent conflict situations arising. They suggest that it is necessary to take time to develop a good understanding of key concepts embedded in the innovation, to examine teacher factors such as their beliefs and teaching practice, and to provide teachers with ongoing professional development, in the process of implementing the innovation. The study concludes with recommendations for a successful implementation of a new assessment system, and with a reflection on the bilingual research process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criterion-referenced tests.</field><field name="subject">Curriculum-based assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1123</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a safety culture : the unintended consequence of a 'one size fits all' policy</field><field name="creator">Allen, Suellen</field><field name="description">Developing a safety culture: The unintended consequence of a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; policy.

Little is known about the safety culture in the Australian maternity setting, which was the impetus for this Study. This thesis reports an examination of the safety culture in a maternity service in New South Wales (NSW). Setting The Study took place in one maternity service located in two public hospitals in NSW, Australia. Concurrently, both hospitals were undergoing an organisational restructure. Design This mixed method research study used a concurrent triangulation design and included two Studies. The Policy Study explored the policy context in which the maternity service was situated; and, the Service Study examined the safety culture within the maternity service. Data collection included: &#8226; A policy audit and chronological mapping of the key policies influencing safety culture within the maternity service. &#8226; Safety culture surveys, the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire and Safety Climate Scale (59/210, 28% response rate) that measured the following six safety culture domains; Safety climate; Teamwork climate; Job Satisfaction; Perceptions of management; Stress recognition and Working conditions (Sexton et al., 2004). &#8226; Semi-structured interviews (15) with key maternity, clinical governance and policy stakeholders. Results The safety culture was found to be lacking across all six safety domains. The key finding was that the overarching policy context created unintended consequences for the maternity service and adversely influenced their capacity to have a positive safety culture. These unintended consequences reduced their available infrastructure and capacity to respond to adverse events; and created a lack of leadership at all levels to drive the safety and quality agenda. The safety culture was also influenced by inadequate communication during the escalation of care; inadequate supervision of junior medical staff; difficulty ensuring the right staffing and skill mix, and low staff morale. Conclusion The safety culture in this maternity setting was complex, context-specific but importantly, influenced by the broader policy context in which it was situated. This Study provides evidence that the policy context needs to be included as a seventh safety culture domain in health care. This Study has demonstrated the importance of policy on the capacity to ensure patient safety. Implications The policy context has not been previously identified as being important when addressing the safety culture in health care. Considering the influence of the policy context in relation to safety culture is an important step to develop strategies to improve patient safety in other settings. This is an area for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maternity care.</field><field name="subject">Public hospitals.</field><field name="subject">Safety culture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1124</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that contribute to midwives staying in midwifery : a study in one Area Health Service in NSW</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Katie J</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that contribute to midwives in one Area Health Service in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, staying in midwifery. The study was set in the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service (NSCCAHS), Australia. A descriptive design underpinned the research. The study was conducted over two phases. Phase One involved focus groups to assess the suitability of a questionnaire for the Australian setting. The questionnaire was previously used in similar research in England. Phase Two was the distribution of the questionnaire and analysis of the data obtained. Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained in the research, though most data were quantitative in nature. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics while content analysis was used on the qualitative data. The study sample consisted of midwives working within NSCCAHS who were employed full-time, part-time or on a casual basis. A total of 392 midwives were surveyed with a response rate of 53% (n=209). The results provided information on the factors which contribute to midwives staying in midwifery. The top three factors identified for midwives staying in midwifery were: relationships with women, professional identity as a midwife and the practice of midwifery. This study has implications for Area Health Services and Health Departments in Australia. If midwifery workforce shortages are to be improved Area Health Services and Health Departments must examine the way in which care is organised and ensure support systems are in place to support advantageous models of care and the midwives who work within them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Northern Sydney Central Coast Health (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Midwifery.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1125</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exercise and GLUT4 expression in type 2 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Hussey, Sophie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Peripheral insulin resistance is characterised by reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and the condition represents one of the earliest hallmarks in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In patients with T2D, protein expression of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, is reduced in adipose tissue, but preserved in skeletal muscle. Transgenic studies in rodents provide evidence that overexpression of GLUT4 selectively in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue enhances whole-body insulin action. Since skeletal muscle accounts for the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, the effect of adipose tissue GLUT4 on insulin sensitivity is thought to be secondary to an altered secretion of adipokines which affect insulin action in muscle, in the context of a &#8216;metabolic crosstalk&#8217; between insulin sensitive tissues. Increasing GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue could be an effective therapy in the treatment of insulin resistance and T2D. Exercise training increases GLUT4 protein expression in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D. This adaptation occurs in the face of enhanced insulin sensitivity, and results from the cumulative and transient increase in GLUT4 mRNA following each acute exercise bout. Less is known regarding the regulation of skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression by a single bout of exercise in patients with T2D, or the effect of exercise training on GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin resistance, exercise, diabetes, GLUT4</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8541</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovering Egypt: Egyptian antiquities at the University of Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Elias, Christine</field><field name="description">This Master of Arts thesis presents the results of research undertaken on two collections of Egyptian antiquities held at the University of Melbourne.

For such a conceptualisation, at the cessation of a transient hydrological disturbance of any magnitude, the model will return to the original stable state and therefore will have an infinite resilience. Ecosystem resilience science propose a very different dynamic where, if the system has a positive feedback, disturbances may shift the system over a threshold where, upon cessation of the disturbance, the system will move to a different steady state. This dissertation brings together concepts from hydrology and ecosystem resilience science to highlight this often implicit assumption within hydrology. It tests the assumption that dry land water-limited catchments always have only one steady state (henceforth referred to as 'attractor'). Following a discussion of this implicit assumption within hydrology, approaches for rigorous testing that could result in its falsification are considered and that of numerical modelling is adopted. The aims of the research were to test this assumption by proposing a biophysically plausible hydrological model; utilise it to investigate the catchment attributes likely to result in multiple attractors; and to assess the model's validity by way of implementation and calibration.

It is endemic in New Zealand and throughout sheep and goat farming regions of the world. The disease results from a mixed bacterial infection, but the essential agent is Dichelobacter nodosus, a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium that possesses type-IV fimbriae on its surface.  Genetic variation in the fimbriae of D. nodosus was investigated in this study. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the variable region of the gene encoding the fimbrial subunit (fimA) was amplified from bacterial DNA extracted from footrot lesions. Different fimA amplimers were differentiated by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. In conjunction with DNA sequencing, 15 unique sequences of D. nodosus fimA were obtained from 14 footrot samples taken from 6 farming regions throughout New Zealand. When these sequences were compared to fimA of known serogroups, it revealed that there were at least 15 D. nodosus strains, representing 8 serogroups, present on New Zealand farms. The predominant serogroup was B which contained 6 strains, followed by serogroups F, H and G. No strains from serogroups D and I were detected in this investigation. Twelve out of the 15 New Zealand D. nodosus strains had fimbriae different to those previously reported and the presence of multiple strains on a single hoof was common (86% of samples).  The fimA sequences from the 12 D. nodosus strains incorporated into the footrot vaccine currently available in New Zealand were determined. A primer set targeting the relatively conserved fimA regions and based on the published sequence of serogroup M Nepalese isolates (designated M-Nep), failed to amplify fimA from the vaccine serotype M strain (designated as M-SPAHL). When the downstream primer was substituted with a primer that was specific for other serogroups of D. nodosus, the fimA gene was successfully amplified. Cloning followed by DNA sequencing, revealed that M-SPAHL fimA was different to M-Nep fimA. The predicted amino acid sequence of M-SPAHL fimA did not show homology to any known serogroups or serotypes. The most similar sequence was from serotype F1, and not M-Nep. The sequence difference between M-SPAHL and M-Nep was larger than that expected within a serogroup. The consequences of serological relatedness and sequence dissimilarity are discussed.  Only eight of the 15 New Zealand field strains had fimbriae identical to those of the vaccine strains, while the remaining seven strains possessed different fimbriae. In addition, the vaccine contained two more D. nodosus strains, representing two sera groups, that were not found on the New Zealand farms investigated in this study. This may, to some extent, explain why the current footrot vaccine is at times less efficient in New Zealand.  Another 17 footrot samples were screened for new or additional D. nodosus strains. Two PCR amplimers (designated X and Y) derived from footrot samples generated SSCP patterns different to those of previously identified strains. DNA sequencing revealed that these two fragments possessed novel sequences. The upstream of X (nt 1-183) was identical to serotype M1 while its downstream (nt 223-414) was identical to serotype F1; the upstream of Y (nt 1-116) was identical to serotype E1 whereas its downstream (nt 148-423) was identical to serotype F1. A 14-mer sequence consisting of two partially overlapping Chi-like sequences, 5'-GCTGGTGCTGGTGA-3', was also found in these fragments. Two primer sets with the downstream primer specific for serotype Fl and the upstream primer specific for serotype M1 or E1, produced PCR products of the expected sizes from the footrot samples from which fragments X and Y were isolated, respectively. These primer sets did not appear to amplify artificially mixed genomic DNA from serotypes M1 and F1 or E1 and F1. However, when the reactions were re-amplified, PCR recombination artefacts were observed, suggesting that PCR recombination does occur, but at a low frequency. It therefore seems more likely that fragments X and Y reflect genuine fimA sequences of D. nodosus which have resulted from in vivo DNA recombination, than from a PCR recombination artifact. The genetic capability for recombination at the fimbrial subunit locus may therefore endow D. nodosus with the ability to alter its antigenic appearance.  D. nodosus strains present in footrot lesions can be genotyped using a PCR-SSCP/sequencing technique. However, this typing technique requires cloning and screening of D. nodosus fimA sequences, which is both laborious and costly. A rapid molecular typing system for D. nodosus was therefore developed in this study. A close examination of available D. nodosus fimA sequences revealed regions that appear to be specific for serogroups and serotypes. These regions were used to design a panel of sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOPs), and a rapid and accurate D. nodosus typing system using PCR and reverse dot-blot hybridisation (PCR/oligotyping) was subsequently developed. The variable region of D. nodosus fimA, amplified and labelled with digoxigenin (DIG) in a single multiplex PCR amplification, was hybridised to a panel of group- and type-specific, poly-dT tailed oligonucleotides that were immobilised on a nylon membrane strip. A mixture of positive control poly-dT tailed oligonucleotides was also included on the membrane. After hybridisation the membrane was washed to a defined specificity, and DIG-labelled fragments that had hybridised were detected. The specificity of the oligonucleotides was verified by the lack of cross-reactivity with D. nodosus fimA sequences that had a single base difference.  DNA from 14 footrot samples previously genotyped by PCR-SSCP/sequencing, was assayed using the PCR/oligotyping technique. All types of D. nodosus which had been detected previously with a PCR-SSCP/sequencing method were detected by this procedure. However, for three of the 14 footrot samples, PCR/oligotyping detected additional types of D. nodosus. Further PCR amplification using type-specific primers, confirmed that these types were present in the original footrot samples. These results indicate that PCR/oligotyping is a specific, accurate, and useful tool for typing footrot samples. In combination with a rapid DNA extraction protocol, D. nodosus present in a footrot sample can be accurately genotyped in less than two days.  Individual animals from the same farm, or the same paddock, were often infected by different strains of D. nodosus. This suggests a host role in mediating footrot infection, or that the interaction between the pathogen and the host is important. In order to better understand the interaction between the bacterium and the host, two polymorphic ovine class II MHC genes DQA1 and DQA2, which have been previously shown to be important in footrot infection, were also investigated in this study. PCR-SSCP/sequencing analysis of the DQA1 locus revealed ten unique ovine DQA1 sequences, with five of them being newly identified. This increases the number of known ovine DQA1 alleles from 8 to 13 (including a null allele), implying a high level of polymorphism at the ovine DQA1 locus.  D. nodosus present on 20 footrot infected sheep from the same flock were genotyped, together with the ovine DQA1 and DQA2 genotypes of their hosts. Preliminary results showed that sheep with the same DQA1 and DQA2 genotypes tended to be infected by similar types of D. nodosus. Different types of D. nodosus were generally found on sheep with different genotypes at either the DQA1 or the DQA2 locus. This suggests the diversity in D. nodosus infection may be associated with the heterogeneity in the host MHC. However, as only a small number of animals from the same sire were analysed, further investigation is needed to gain a better understanding of the interaction between D. nodosus and the host MHC.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">footrot</field><field name="subject">Dichelobacter nodosus</field><field name="subject">fimA variation</field><field name="subject">fimA recombination</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">SSCP</field><field name="subject">bacterial genotyping</field><field name="subject">ovine MHC</field><field name="subject">ovine DQA</field><field name="subject">070707 - Veterinary Microbiology (excl.

For some workers, this has meant experiencing wages and working conditions that challenge the Australian tradition that employment will be sufficient for avoiding poverty and securing the reproduction of labour. The trend of polarisation nationally was also evident in the Metals Manufacturing industry and in the lllawarra region. The two most significant developments in Metals Manufacturing in the 1990s were (i) the rise in casual employment (including labour hire); and (ii) the masculinisation of employment in the industry, including non-standard employment. These two developments occurred in the context of prolonged decline in total employment in Metals Manufacturing.Polarisation in Metals Manufacturing was most evident in wages, hours of work and by employment status. Studying polarisation in this industry revealed a dynamic relation between the degradation and polarisation of labour market standards. The disadvantages of casual employment relative to the advantages of permanent employment mean that its expansion contributed to polarisation. But employment decline and casualisation (particularly through labour hire and outsourcing) were found to have placed pressure on the standards and working conditions of permanent workers. So degradation was evident. Nevertheless, the declioe in employment and the casualisation of employment also made permanent work much more valuable because of its relative scarcity. This change in relativity between permanent and casual employment represents polarisation, regardless of the degradation in standards experienced by permanent workers.In keeping with labour market segmentation theory, it was found that labour market trends in the 1990s were constructed upon long-standing segmentation based on sex and language-background. However, segmentation in the Metals Manufacturing industry at the end of the 1990s is different from traditional labour market segmentation because labour market disadvantage is not limited to those workers traditionally considered to have secondary or marginal status because of their sex or language-background.The causes of polarisation were considered through the lens of labour market segmentation theory, which places most weight on the role of employers when explaining labour market advantage and disadvantage. Such an explanation was assessed relative to competing explanations provided by neo-classical labour economics and by Metals Manufacturing employers that gave market forces and the choices of individual employees most weight. Segmentation theory was shown to provide a much more plausible explanation of polarisation on empirical and ontological grounds.Extensive and intensive methods were used to reach this conclusion, with the research design guided by critical realism, geography and organisation theory as well as labour market segmentation theory. The research design was aimed at explaining the labour market in terms of causal relations at multiple levels, where levels were taken to be in an interconstitutive relation rather than separate (like the way that tiles can form a mosaic while retaining their own distinctiveness). The levels studied were: the nation, the region, the industry, the workplace and that of individual employees. The research design also depended on developing a more accurate and useful conception of the employer-labour market relation. Segmentation theorists have retained the internal labour market concept from neo-classical labour economics that impedes analysis of the way that actions of one employer can influence the actions of another. A new approach to understanding the employer-labour market relation that has more explanatory power is developed and applied in this thesis. It unpacks the employer-labour market relation by distinguishing employers singularly, employers singularly as an interactive group, and employers collectively. Considering the role of employers in this way provides deeper understanding of the contemporary spatial struggle in Metals Manufacturing between employers' preferences for an enterprise-level approach to industrial relations and trade unions' preferences for an industry-level approach, and the consequences of this struggle for industrial relations, gender equity and the management of labour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2034</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical applications of three-dimensional stress change measurements and displacements in underground coal mines</field><field name="creator">Nemcik, Jan Anton</field><field name="description">Theoretical advances in mathematical analyses, numerical modelling and computer technology has significantly increased the knowledge of stress distribution around underground excavations. The complexity of rock behaviour, especially of the sedimentary soft rock type has made exact mathematical predictions very difficult. The need for alternative methods was clearly defined.In the past various methods to measure in situ stresses were developed. Early measurements were in most cases limited to one dimension and were often used to measure the magnitude of vertical stress concentrations around the mine openings.No detailed discussions on the historical stress measurement development is attempted here since many publications dealing with the topic are readily available.To understand the behaviour of strata around the mine openings located within laminated and often strain softened rock, it is necessary to conduct a detailed underground geotechnical investigation.In general, the geological complexity and rock behaviour in most underground coal mines requires in situ investigation of: a) geological structure of roof rock, coal and the floor rock, b) geological disturbances such as faults,         fractures and other discontinuities associated with displacement c) detailed stress/displacement measurements as   mining takes place.Results are then used for mine planning purposes, mine sequencing, pillar design and design of efficient roof reinforcement.No detailed 3-dimensional stress measurements in coal mines were conducted till recent advances in usage of CSIRO 3-dimensional soft inclusion stress cells developed by ACIRL. The stress cells were originally designed for overcoring stress measurements. 3-dimensional stress measurements were often used in metalliferous mines for some time to measure long term stress changes in stopes. Despite many problems new techniques were developed and verified to efficiently record the full three dimensional stress changes in the coal measures as adjacent coal extraction takes place.The following text deals with a short history of the stress and displacement origins and the monitoring techniques used. Two detailed case histories of extensive geotechnical installation are presented with monitoring and interpretation of strata behaviour in underground coal mines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2369</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment decisions and the puzzle of share price movements in capital markets: a case study</field><field name="creator">Putrasemadhi, Ngurah Arya</field><field name="description">Information criteria is critical in the study of users' information needs.

Using Samoa as a case study this research seeks to engage in this debate by critiquing the impact of contemporary globalisation on an indigenous culture. Samoa was chosen as a case study because of its global engagement and because its culture, fa&#8217;aSamoa, is celebrated for resilience. The Samoan people, like many Pacific Islanders, are renowned for their mobility. After World War II sojourns turned into more permanent journeys, however, when increasing numbers of Samoans responded to offshore opportunities. What resulted was the formation of a vibrant Samoan community across the Pacific Rim. Exploring the nexus between this &#8216;transnational corporation of kin&#8217; and the impact on contemporary Samoan society is at the core of this thesis. In so doing this study engages with broader debates around development, modernity and cultural transformation.The primary research data for the study was gathered through interviews with Samoans in New Zealand, Australia, USA and Samoa. Interview questions centered on migration history and motivation, identity, life in the diaspora and cultural changes. Supplementary data was sourced via public internet sites, artwork, novels, poetry, music, documentary film and newspapers. In order to critique cultural change, whereby teasing out points of tension and negotiation, I examined what were judged to be indicative areas of susceptibility: the traditional system of governance, fa&#8217;amatai, the shifts in motivations behind people&#8217;s decision to migrate and changes around personal, group and community identity.The findings are detailed in four chapters focusing on changing forms of cultural enactment, shifts in motivation behind emigration, issues of identity and a specific chapter on youth &#8216;inbetweenness&#8217;. Complexity has increased across all sectors of the Samoan community. In particular the fa&#8217;matai governance system is under increasing pressure, with some questioning its capacity to negotiate the added burden. Most, however, continued to express confidence, pointing to its on-going flexibility and increasing openness. Given the centrality of this system to fa&#8217;aSamoa the implications are highly significant. The impact of shifting attitudes and behaviour around emigration, and changing ideas about identity and &#8216;connectivity&#8217; were, likewise, found to have the potential to devastate fa&#8217;aSamoa. It is ultimately concluded, however, that Samoans will continue their process of strategic adaptation and that fa&#8217;aSamoa will continue to hold relevance and provide guidance.The implications of this research go beyond the bounds of the Samoan case study. First noted is the need to culturally contextualise studies and next, the importance of seeking out and encompassing indigenous knowledge. There are implications also for our understanding of development. The findings of this study highlight the need also to recognise the ongoing place of tradition in the lives of indigenous peoples everywhere, even those who have &#8216;reached&#8217; a state of modernity. Finally the importance of facilitating strong transnational networks is stressed. Maintaining pathways will assist the network to remain strong which, in turn, has implications for the economic, political and social wellbeing of those living within it and for the region as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3090</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of legal issues relating to navigational rights and freedoms through and over Indonesian waters</field><field name="creator">Buntoro, Kresno</field><field name="description">The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) provides a delicate balance between the interests of archipelagic States such as Indonesia and the international community with respect to navigation. Indonesia recognises three navigation rights and freedoms within Indonesian waters: innocent passage, transit passage and archipelagic sea lanes passage. In addition, Indonesia and Malaysia have negotiated an additional passage right not mentioned in the LOSC called access and communication passage. The vagueness and ambiguity of the LOSC provisions on navigational rights and freedoms, as well as the absence of further guidance on their interpretation and implementation, have resulted in conflicting claims between Indonesia on one hand and the international community on the other.  This thesis aims to provide an analysis of the legal issues relating to navigation through and over Indonesian waters. In particular, it aims to examine inconsistencies between Indonesian navigational regimes and those permitted by the LOSC to ascertain if Indonesia has applied the LOSC correctly and, if necessary, to propose reforms to harmonise national legislation with international law. Specifically, the thesis will first, explain the extent, historical development and concept of navigational regimes in the LOSC and international law in general. Second, it will analyse the implementation of the navigational provisions of the LOSC by Indonesia. Finally, it will provide recommendations concerning the harmonisation of the Indonesian domestic legal framework with international law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3091</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The age of smart cards: an exploratory investigation of the sociotechnical factors influencing smart card innovation (1974-1996)</field><field name="creator">Lindley, Robyn Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis breaks new ground by providing the first detailed study of smart card innovation during its first twenty years (1974-1996). The overall aim is to apply sociotechnical principles to further our understanding of the innovation process as it relates to smart card technology. By using a sociotechnical framework, this study also seeks to illustrate the limitations of conventional innovation theory when applied to new information technologies such as smart card: The central thesis posited, is that to develop our understanding of the underlying innovation processes that have occurred during the development of this new information technology, it is necessary to study the interactions between three actors that have all appeared to play a role in the process of smart card innovation. These are smart card technology; the potential users and the organisations. However, in stating this, it is also important to realize that one tacit assumption underlying the work reported here is that new technologies are only adopted if the technological parameters (technology focus), the market needs (user focus) and the entrepreneurs (organisational focus) meet.At a more abstract level, the work has also endeavoured to consider whether a sociotechnical approach applied as a framework for understanding the process of innovation for smart card is, in fact, a reasonable and useful paradigm for developing our understanding from both a theoretical and applied perspective. Thus the multidisciplinary process approach adopted is not intended to lead to a complete alternative theory:  nor is it intended to be merely a synthesis.What the current work has achieved, is to provide the very first insights into the understanding of smart card innovation. The sociotechnical framework adopted as a theoretical organiser and, which emphasises the role of the user, has also served to highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to develop our understanding of smart card innovation. The view upheld is that the paradigm emerging from these analyses based on traditional innovation thought, both demands and empowers the view of smart card innovation as a sociotechnical process. One of the main outcomes has been to demonstrate that smart card innovation provides a case in point highlighting the benefits of adopting a broad and evolutionary approach to innovation and based on a sociotechnical framework. This is in agreement with recent paradigm shifts in technology innovation thought. For the practitioner, these findings also illuminate new possibilities for the development theoretically informed smart card systems, thus placing the smart card design team in a position to significantly and positively influence future smart card innovation patterns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1450</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plural Australia: Aboriginal and Asian labour in tropical white Australia, Darwin, 1911-1940</field><field name="creator">Mart&#237;nez, Julia</field><field name="description">This thesis questions the dominance of White Australia as a narrative of Australian history by highlighting opposition to the policy and its vision of a pure white nation.

A northern, tropical perspective on Australian history undermines the traditional narrative of British colonisation and the supposedly unanimous desire to maintain a White Australia. Darwin was established as a mixed tropical colony and maintained its multiethnic society right throughout the White Australia period.White Australia as a political and ideological principle has always been problematic. During the period up until 1940, the debate continued over the inclusion or exclusion of Australia's 'coloured' population within the nation, particularly in regard to Aboriginal and Asian workers. White Australia may have viewed these groups as potential competition to white workers, and as a threat to 'racial' purity, but this remained a contested issue. Colonial attitudes, which favoured 'cheap coloured' labour were retained. Internationalists, in contrast, preferred to include 'coloured' workers within the workforce and the community as equal members. Even staunch advocates of White Australia came to question the exclusion of 'coloured' residents from their community. This thesis argues that the primary issue for Australian nationalists was to create a unified and harmonious nation. It had been imagined that this would be achieved only with a 'racially' homogeneous population. But the experience of Darwin suggests that it was possible for a new kind of plural society to develop even under White Australia. The degree to which various ethnic groups were incorporated into the white working-class community differed, as is demonstrated in the case studies of Aboriginal servants and waterside workers, Japanese and 'Malay' pearling crews and Chinese workers. The character of Plural Australia was shaped, not simply by political, ideological or even economic considerations, but by the evolving responses of white Australians to their experience of living within a multiethnic community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1437</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of a Newly Identified Human Rhinovirus: HRV-QPM</field><field name="creator">Mr Peter Mcerlean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Rhinovirus,&#160;respiratory&#160;illness,&#160;picornavirus,&#160;in&#160;silico&#160;analysis.&#160;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159338</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Inference for the general Ising model is NP-hard; this includes tasks such as calculating the partition function, finding a lowest-energy (ground) state and computing marginal probabilities. Past approaches have proceeded by working with classes of tractable Ising models, such as Ising models defined on a planar graph. For such models, the partition function and ground state can be computed exactly in polynomial time by establishing a correspondence with perfect matchings in a related graph.

In this thesis we continue this line of research. In particular we simplify previous inference algorithms for the planar Ising model. The key to our construction is the complementary correspondence between graph cuts of the model graph and perfect matchings of its expanded dual. We show that our exact algorithms are effective and efficient on a number of real-world machine learning problems. We also investigate heuristic methods for approximating ground states of non-planar Ising models.

that the advantage of OFDM over the single-carrier modulation schemes could be
substantially compromised by timing or frequency estimation errors at the receiver.
In this thesis we investigate the synchronization problem for practical OFDM systems using a system model generalized from the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16
standards. 

For preamble based synchronization schemes, which are most common in the
downlink of wireless communication systems, we propose a novel timing acquisition algorithm which minimizes false alarm probability and indirectly improves correct detection probability. We then introduce a universal fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator that outperforms conventional methods at low signal to noise ratio with lower complexity. More accurate timing and frequency estimates can be obtained by our proposed frequency-domain algorithms incorporating channel knowledge. We derive four joint frequency, timing, and channel estimators with different approximations, and then propose a hybrid integer CFO estimation scheme to provide flexible performance and complexity tradeoffs. When the exact channel delay profile is unknown at the receiver, we present a successive timing estimation algorithm to solve the timing ambiguity. Both analytical and simulation results are presented to confirm the performance of the proposed methods in various realistic channel conditions.

The ranging based synchronization scheme is most commonly used in the uplink
of wireless communication systems. Here we propose a successive multiuser detection algorithm to mitigate multiple access interference and achieve better performance than that of conventional single-user based methods. A reduced-complexity version of the successive algorithm feasible for hardware real-time implementation is also presented in the thesis. To better understand the performance of a ranging detector from a system point of view, we develop a technique that can directly translate a detector&#239;&#191;&#189;s missed detection probability into the maximum number of users that the method can support in one cell with a given number of ranging opportunities. The analytical results match the simulations reasonably well and show that the proposed successive algorithms allow a base station to serve more than double the number of users supported by the conventional methods.

Finally, we investigate inter-carrier interference which is caused by the timevarying
communication channels. We derive the bounds on the power of residual inter-carrier interference that cannot be mitigated by a frequency-domain equalizer with a given number of taps. We also propose a Turbo equalization scheme using the novel grouped Particle filter, which approaches the performance of the Maximum A Posterior algorithm with much lower complexity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">timing estimation</field><field name="subject">frequency estimation</field><field name="subject">modem synchronization</field><field name="subject">OFDM</field><field name="subject">CFO</field><field name="subject">orthogonal frequency division multiplexing</field><field name="subject">joint channel estimation and data detection</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100728.103929</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graphical Models: Modeling, Optimization, and Hilbert Space Embedding</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xinhua</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades graphical models have been widely used as powerful tools for compactly representing distributions. On the other hand, kernel methods have been used extensively to come up with rich representations. This thesis aims to combine graphical models with kernels to produce compact models with rich representational abilities. Graphical models are a powerful underlying formalism in machine learning. Their graph theoretic properties provide both an intuitive modular interface to model the interacting factors, and a data structure facilitating efficient learning and inference. The probabilistic nature ensures the global consistency of the whole framework, and allows convenient interface of models to data. Kernel methods, on the other hand, provide an effective means of representing rich classes of features for general objects, and at the same time allow efficient search for the optimal model. Recently, kernels have been used to characterize distributions by embedding them into high dimensional feature space. Interestingly, graphical models again decompose this characterization and lead to novel and direct ways of comparing distributions based on samples. Among the many uses of graphical models and kernels, this thesis is devoted to the following four areas: Conditional random fields for multi-agent reinforcement learning 

Conditional random fields (CRFs) are graphical models for modelling the probability of labels given the observations. They have traditionally been trained with using a set of observation and label pairs. Underlying all CRFs is the assumption that, conditioned on the training data, the label sequences of different training examples are independent and identically distributed (iid ). We extended the use of CRFs to a class of temporal learning algorithms, namely policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL). Now the labels are no longer iid. They are actions that update the environment and affect the next observation. From an RL point of view, CRFs provide a natural way to model joint actions in a decentralized Markov decision process. They define how agents can communicate with each other to choose the optimal joint action. We tested our framework on a synthetic network alignment problem, a distributed sensor network, and a road traffic control system. Using tree sampling by Hamze &amp; de Freitas (2004) for inference, the RL methods employing CRFs clearly outperform those which do not model the proper joint policy. 

Bayesian online multi-label classification Gaussian density filtering (GDF) provides fast and effective inference for graphical models (Maybeck, 1982). Based on this natural online learner, we propose a Bayesian online multi-label classification (BOMC) framework which learns a probabilistic model of the linear classifier. The training labels are incorporated to update the posterior of the classifiers via a graphical model similar to TrueSkill (Herbrich et al., 2007), and inference is based on GDF with expectation propagation. Using samples from the posterior, we label the test data by maximizing the expected F-score. Our experiments on Reuters1-v2 dataset show that BOMC delivers significantly higher macro-averaged F-score than the state-of-the-art online maximum margin learners such as LaSVM (Bordes et al., 2005) and passive aggressive online learning (Crammer et al., 2006). The online nature of BOMC also allows us to effciently use a large amount of training data. 

Hilbert space embedment of distributions 
Graphical models are also an essential tool in kernel measures of independence for non-iid data. Traditional information theory often requires density estimation, which makes it unideal for statistical estimation. Motivated by the fact that distributions often appear in machine learning via expectations, we can characterize the distance between distributions in terms of distances between means, especially means in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces which are called kernel embedment. Under this framework, the undirected graphical models further allow us to factorize the kernel embedment onto cliques, which yields efficient measures of independence for non-iid data (Zhang et al., 2009). We show the effectiveness of this framework for ICA and sequence segmentation, and a number of further applications and research questions are identified. Optimization in maximum margin models for structured data Maximum margin estimation for structured data, e.g. (Taskar et al., 2004), is an important task in machine learning where graphical models also play a key role. They are special cases of regularized risk minimization, for which bundle methods (BMRM, Teo et al., 2007) and the closely related SVMStruct (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) are state-of-the-art general purpose solvers. Smola et al. (2007b) proved that BMRM requires O(1/&#941;) iterations to converge to an &#941; accurate solution, and we further show that this rate hits the lower bound. By utilizing the structure of the objective function, we devised an algorithm for the structured loss which converges to an &#941; accurate solution in O(1/&#8730;&#941;) iterations. This algorithm originates from Nesterov's optimal first order methods (Nesterov, 2003, 2005b).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine Learning</field><field name="subject">Graphical Models</field><field name="subject">Kernel Methods</field><field name="subject">Optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100729.072500</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Housing Market: Price Dynamics and Capital Stock Growth</field><field name="creator">Mikhailitchenko, Serguei</field><field name="description">This study was motivated by the desire to contribute to the understanding of the movement of house prices and the role of the so-called economic &#145;fundamentals&#146; in the housing market, especially within an Australian context.

We do this by constructing an analytical framework, or model, that encompasses the most important characteristics of the housing market. This thesis examines two important aspects of the Australian housing market: movements of house prices and changes in the net capital stock of dwellings in Australia. Movements of house prices are modelled from two perspectives: firstly, using the &#145;fundamental&#146; approach, which explains the phenomena by changes in such &#145;fundamental&#146; explanatory variables as income, interest rates, population and prices of building materials, and secondly, by analysing spatial interdependence of house prices in Australian capital cities.

While the thesis identifies some of the factors responsible for the success of the international heroin trade, the primary aim is to focus on one facilitating aspect &#150; global financial flows of &#145;illegal&#146; or &#145;hot&#146; money. Central to the argument is that international production and trade in illegal heroin are buttressed by cycles of economic contractions within the world economy and by a global financial system that provides the means for the heroin trade&#146;s profits to be easily laundered and invested in the legal economy. To illustrate the utility of these approaches in terms of a world-systems context, the thesis employs a global commodity chain perspective and elaborates the case study of H&#252;seyin Baybasin, a highly prominent convicted Kurdish businessman who has sometimes been identified as the world&#146;s leading international heroin trafficker. This particular case study permits us to examine not only the complex web of historical, cultural, social, economic and political interactions within the international heroin trade, but also how the global heroin commodity chain is relevant to the broader debate about secessionist ethnic nationalism and development in the Third World. Focusing on Turkey, the thesis outlines the early historical periods in which different traditional patterns have prevailed for the majority of Kurdish people, and explains the disappearance of these patterns through the process of modernisation and globalisation, and how this relates to the global heroin trade. The argument thus provides an alternative, world-systems perspective to the more familiar accounts of international heroin trafficking that tend to focus on conventional interpretations of supply and demand and the activities of law enforcement agencies in physical interdiction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international heroin trafficking</field><field name="subject">Southwest Asia</field><field name="subject">global heroin trade</field><field name="subject">global commodity chain perspective</field><field name="subject">global heroin commodity chain</field><field name="subject">international production of heroin</field><field name="subject">international trade of heroin</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100729.112710</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation, transportation and engineering of entanglement between two separate qubit systems</field><field name="creator">Sze-liang Chan</field><field name="description">Quantum entanglement is widely renounced as one of the most fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.

In particular, the research is mainly focused on the study of the dynamics of the well known maximally entangled Bell state under different in&#64258;uences such as decoherence and inter-qubit coupling.

The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into high impedance ground faults on SWER systems / by Enyonam Agbodo.</field><field name="creator">Agbodo, Enyonam</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng)--University of South Australia, 1995</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overhead electric lines</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83355</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42609</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration and development of GIS-based tools for transportation planning applications /</field><field name="creator">Affum, Joseph</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 1996</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographic information systems.</field><field name="subject">Transportation engineering</field><field name="subject">Transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/84923</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42982</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics and control of drug used populations /</field><field name="creator">Agrawal, Manju</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two parts: practical and theoretical.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD.

The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signal processing for MC-CDMA /</field><field name="creator">Akhter, Mohammad Shahanshah</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng)--University of South Australia, 1998</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code division multiple access.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Radio</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83320</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42642</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the relationships between distinctive capabilities, business strategy and performance of Malaysian exporting SMEs /</field><field name="creator">Ahmad, Sa'ari bin</field><field name="description">Despite the importance of SMEs and increased knowledge in the area of strategic management, empirical research on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in this area of management has not only been limited but also neglected.

In the first part (Chapter 3), three cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) adapted to South Australian conditions were tested for drought tolerance under cyclic drought in growth rooms and glasshouse. Extensive physiological traits, including stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, ABA content, water status traits (e.g. osmotic adjustment, RWC and leaf water potential), water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and carbon isotope discrimination (&#916;&#185; &#179;C) were measured during experiments. Through these experiments, the drought responses of the three cultivars were physiologically dissected and the likely processes contributing most to drought tolerance were identified. In the South Australian wheatbelt, cyclic drought is a frequent event, represented by intermittent periods of rainfall which can occur around anthesis and post-anthesis in wheat. Three South Australian bread wheat cultivars, Excalibur, Kukri and RAC875, were evaluated in two growth room experiments under cyclic water-limiting conditions. In the first experiment, where plants were subjected to severe water stress, RAC875 and Excalibur (drought tolerant) showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher grain yield under cyclic water availability compared to Kukri (drought susceptible), producing 44% and 18% more grain yield compared to Kukri, respectively. In the second growth room experiment, where plants were subjected to a milder drought stress, the differences between cultivars were less pronounced, with only RAC875 showing significantly higher grain yield under the cyclic water treatment. Grain number per spike and the percentage of aborted tillers were the major yield components that affected yield under cyclic water stress. Excalibur and RAC875 adopted different morpho-physiological traits and mechanisms to reduce water stress. Excalibur was most responsive to cyclic water availability and showed the highest level of osmotic adjustment (OA), highest stomatal conductance, lowest ABA content and most rapid recovery from stress under cyclic water stress. RAC875 was more &#8216;conservative&#8217; in its responses, with moderate OA, high leaf waxiness, high chlorophyll content and slower recovery from stress. Within this germplasm, the capacity for osmotic adjustment was the main physiological attribute associated with tolerance under cyclic water stress, which enabled plants to recover from water deficit. In the second part (Chapter 4), the genetic linkage map of a DH population including 368 lines, which was developed from a cross between &#8216;RAC875&#8217; and &#8216;Kukri&#8217;, was constructed. The genetic linkage map consisted of about 500 molecular markers including ~300 DArT (Diversity array technology) and ~200 SSR (Microsattelite markers). In the third part (Chapter 5), Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) linked to plant phenology and production traits under irrigated and drought stress conditions were mapped by means of a DH population. To phenotype the population, 368 DH lines were cultivated in two replicates in five environments (three sites across South Australian wheatbelt in collaboration with Australian Grain Technology (AGT) in 2006, and two trials in Mexico in collaboration with CYMMIT, 2007). Data of grain yield, yield components, maturity related traits and some morpho-physiological traits such as leaf chlorophyll content, leaf waxiness, plant height, peduncle length, flag leaf and spike length were measured. Raw data were then analysed for spatial variation for each single trial using the REML procedure in GenStat (version 6). The DH lines showed significant variation for plant phenology, grain yield and yield components under irrigated and drought stress conditions. QTL analyses were performed using QTLCartographer and QTLNetwork for each trait in each site. Two major QTL for maturity traits were identified on chromosomes 2BS and 2DS corresponding to Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1, respectively. A region was identified on chromosome 7A that harbored major QTL for grain yield, number of grains per square meter, number of grain per spike and spike fertility under drought stress. For yield data in the irrigated trial, two major QTL were identified on chromosome 3B which were not detected in drought stress environments. By using different datasets in the QTL analysis (splitting the population into two subpopulation based on heading time and also adjusting the phenotypic data for heading time to eliminate heading time effect), a QTL for grain yield was consistently detected on chromosome 7A in drought-affected environments. The coincidence of a drought response index QTL on this chromosome indicated that it might be a QTL for yield response under drought. This study demonstrated that the region on the long arm of chromosome 7A identified for grain yield and yield components is a drought response QTL which is closely linked to, but separate from, a heading time QTL. This QTL cluster on chromosome 7A could be used as a good target for positional cloning and gene isolation. However further work would be required to confirm and validate the identified QTLs in this preliminary QTL analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drought; wheat; linkage map; quantitative trait loci (QTL)</field><field name="subject">Wheat Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Wheat Growth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wine yeasts of New Zealand: an investigation into their distribution, contribution to sauvignon blanc aroma and interaction in co-ferments</field><field name="creator">Anfang, Nicole</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until July 2011, but available by request, use the feedback form to request access.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5834</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AC/DC : a study in art, gender and  popular culture : an exegesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Syme, Gemma</field><field name="description">This thesis began as an artistic investigation into the politics of identity and sex/sexuality. The main ideas that run throughout this exegesis position themselves within Nicolas Bourriaud&#8217;s ideas in the book Postproduction, and also around a parafeminist ideology. Within this I focus on popular music culture, the body, video and performance art, and visual representations of the body. I pay particular attention to the female body, and look into ideas of conventional social norms and how people challenge these. I look into the work of several female artists who deal with the visual representation, and also look at figures within popular music culture. Within band culture I look into how the band can be used as a vehicle to disseminate ideas wider audience. Art and music culture have fed off of each other for generations and can provide valuable strategies within each context for thinking beyond social norms. The remix can be used as a tactic to decode forms and narratives in popular culture. This can be used to investigate representations of identity within a space that is in a constant state of flux. This is particularly useful as a parafeminist strategy because it allows a context in which to question, rather than answer. As a result of this study I have found that there are no concrete answers when it comes to identity and sexuality, but can conclude that conventional gender representations and signifiers of identity can be remixed into different scenarios and narratives that can challenge social norms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">representations of the body</field><field name="subject">female artists</field><field name="subject">band culture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">parafeminism</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410199 Performing arts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/947</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bovine spliceosomal U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle : a study of its autoantigenicity and biochemical properties : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Despite individual autoimmune diseases being relatively rare, collectively these diseases afflict 8 % of the population according to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association. With over 75 % of those affected being women, autoimmune disease has been recognised, by the World Health Organisation and the US National Institutes of Health, as a major global women's health issue. One third of autoimmune sufferers have a rheumatological disorder, which commonly affect the joints, muscle, skin, salivary glands and kidneys. Antibodies against nuclear antigens are a serological hallmark of these diseases. Detection of these antibodies is used in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. The sensitivity and specificity of the test, of which the antigen is a key component, is pivotal to correct disease diagnosis and management. The relationship between circulating autoantibodies and the target antigen is complex. Improving the effectiveness of a test to assist in diagnosis and prognosis comes from characterisation and understanding these complex relationships. This thesis compares bovine spliceosomal U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) complex with its human equivalent, and examines the validity of using this bovine derived autoantigen in the diagnosis of the human autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed connective tissue disease. Differences between bovine and human U1 snRNP composition were characterised using a combination of electrophoretic, immunoassay and mass spectrometry techniques. Although the U1C protein could not be identified in bovine U1 snRNP, all other specificities were present. U1A remained intact, whilst the U1 snRNP specific 68K protein was dephosphorylated and a large C-terminal domain was removed, such that 68K migrated as a 30-36 kDa cluster on SDS-PAGE. Bovine SmD proteins, present in U1 and non-U1 snRNPs, were unaffected, whereas, SmB'/B was truncated to a 12 kDa peptide, which interestingly, was no longer reactive with anti-RNP sera in western blot. The recognition of human SmB'/B protein by anti-RNP sera in western blot was further examined. A technique was developed to immunoaffinity purify tryptic digests of SmB'/B which could then be analysed by mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the human replication element protein (HREP) was tentatively identified, rather than SmB'/B as expected. It may be possible, therefore, that anti-RNP sera may be reacting with a protein other than SmB'/B. To examine the contribution of the individual U1 snRNP proteins to anti-RNP and anti-Sm sera reactivities, a method was developed to dissociate bovine U1 snRNP and to purify the individual component antigens. It was demonstrated both empirically and through anecdotal feedback from a commercial diagnostic kit producer that patient sera respond better to purified Sm-free 68K than the recombinant 68K antigen. The effect of commercial processing of bovine thymus, the source for U1 snRNP antigen, was determined. In this study, variables that may be controlled during processing, such as temperature, protease activity and pH, were investigated. Hydrolysis of the intact human 68K protein with the necrotic protease, cathepsin L, produced 38 and 25 kDa fragments, whereas exposure to ambient temperature and low pH produced 32 kDa peptide fragments similar to those observed in purified bovine 68K. It was therefore proposed that 68K protein may undergo autocatalytic hydrolysis during necrotic cell death. Thorough characterisation of the bovine spliceosomal U1 snRNP proteins has not only validated their use as diagnostic reagents in autoimmune disease but also provided some insight into the inactivation of U1 snRNP function during early cell death.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoimmune disease</field><field name="subject">Antibodies detection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270101 Analytical biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1504</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a spectrometer for portable NMR systems : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physics at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Dykstra, Robin</field><field name="description">CD containing a copy of the thesis, software and extra documentation is held with print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-destructive testing</field><field name="subject">Spectrometer design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::249900 Other Physical Sciences::249903 Instruments and techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1505</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of GIS and remote sensing to identify areas at risk from erosion in Indonesian forests : a case study in central Java : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Natural Resource Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Savitri, Endang</field><field name="description">Environmental degradation and soil erosion begins when production forests are harvested. Unfortunately, logging cannot be avoided in plantation forests and since this operation can render the land more susceptible to erosion, any negative impacts need to be addressed properly. Erosion potential is predicted by evaluating the response of land cover, soil and slope to the impact of rainfall and human activities. The role of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) in erosion prediction is to collect information from images and maps; combine and analyse these data so that it is possible to predict the erosion risk. The objective of this study was to produce a method to identify areas most susceptible to erosion and predict erosion risk. It is intended that the method be used particularly by forestry planners and decision makers so that they can improve forest management, especially during logging. The study area was within Kebumen and Banjarnegara districts of Central Java, Indonesia. Imagery used included a Landsat 7 satellite image (28th April 2001) and panchromatic aerial photos (5th July 1993). Other data was derived from topographical, soil, and geological maps, and 10 years of daily rainfall data from 17 rainfall stations. Predicting erosion in this study was done by combining rainfall, slope, geology, and land cover data. The erosion risk was predicted using land cover and soil type and depth. A rainfall map was generated using a thin plate spline method. A slope map was derived from a DEM which was generated by digitizing contours and spot heights from topographic maps. A geological map was derived from Landsat image classification with assistance from a 1:100000 scale geological map; and a land cover map was produced from an interpretation of the Landsat image and aerial photographs. A stratified classification technique was used to delineate land covers in the study area with an accuracy of 44%. The low accuracy could be attributed to the complexity of the area and the temporal variation in the data acquisition. The analysis of erosion risk showed that mixed forests and monotype forest experienced high and moderately high erosion risk. This condition supported the contention that harvest plans must incorporate soil conservation measures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil erosion</field><field name="subject">Forest management</field><field name="subject">Erosion prediction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300604 Management and environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1506</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of Environmental Management System (EMS) applied by large manufacturing companies in Amata Nakorn Industrial Town and other areas of Chonburi Province, Thailand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jitsoonthornchaikul, Arthorn</field><field name="description">Industrial pollution is one the most critical environmental problems facing Thailand at the present time. Therefore, control of industrial pollution is of the highest priority to the Thai government. Problems associated with industrial pollution place significant limitations on the potential growth of manufacturing industries in Thailand, because international trade today requires not only manufactured products of a high quality but also a commitment to high environmental standards by manufacturing companies (European Commission Environment Directorate-General, 2001; Ken, 2004). This thesis investigated the major dimensions of the quality of the Environmental Management System (EMS) in large size manufacturers, that are located both inside and outside of industrial towns in Chonburi Province, Thailand. In particular, the research examined whether different stakeholders had the same or different perceptions about these dimensions. The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to collect information from four groups of stakeholders: Thailand's government officers in the government agencies concerned about environmental policy; top management within manufacturers; the manufacturers' staff at management level; and the local communities. A survey was carried out involving the government officers and top management staff within manufacturers. The qualitative data were collected from documentaries, interviews and observations. The triangulation of methods and data permitted the comparison of the perceptions of the manufacturers' staff, from both inside and outside of industrial towns. The data were structured into the four major parts of an EMS: the performance agreement for the environmental programme; the plan for transformation implementation; the standards and processes; and the continuous improvement process. The survey results show that manufacturers in the Town use ISO 14001. Two of the three manufacturers, outside the Town use TQM / TQEM as their EMS and the other manufacturer, also from outside the Town, does not have any EMS within their company. The results also show that the factories in the Town, that used IS0 14001 and the factories outside of the Town that used TQM ITQEM, are similar in the four major parts of the EMS. However, they still have some processes which are notably different, such as the manufacturers that use ISO 14001 have better documentary systems, additional budgets for training staff and larger budgets to publicise, to the local communities, the companies' activities relating to their environmental management. However, the TQM / TQEM and Thailand's environmental legislation are more flexible and they allow companies to create environmental management activities. Finally, the results suggest that there are three main factors that may effect the achievement of environmental management within manufacturers in Thailand. They are: the human factor (knowledge and awareness about the environment); the processes factor (green production and EMS processes); and the legislation factor (environmental standards, monitoring and enforcement systems).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industry and environment</field><field name="subject">Environmental policy</field><field name="subject">Environmental management</field><field name="subject">Industrial management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1507</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding systems and reproduction of indigenous shrubs in fragmented ecosystems : Breeding systems and reproduction of indigenous shrubs in fragmented ecosystems :|ba thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Ecology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Merrett, Merilyn F.</field><field name="description">Sixteen native shrub species with various breeding systems and pollination syndromes were investigated in geographically separated populations to determine breeding systems, reproductive success, population structure, and habitat characteristics. Of the sixteen species, seven are hermaphroditic, seven dioecious, and two gynodioecious. Two of the dioecious species are cryptically dioecious, producing what appear to be perfect, hermaphroditic flowers, but that function as either male or female. One of the study species, Raukaua anomalus, was thought to be dioecious, but proved to be hermaphroditic. Teucridium parvifolium, was thought to be hermaphroditic, but some populations are gynodioecious. There was variation in self-compatibility among the four Alseuosmia species; two are self-compatible and two are self-incompatible. Self-incompatibility was consistent amongst individuals only in A. quercifolia at both study sites, whereas individuals in A. macrophylla ranged from highly self-incompatible to self-compatible amongst four study sites. The remainder of the hermaphroditic study species are self-compatible. Five of the species appear to have dual pollination syndromes, e.g., bird-moth, wind-insect, wind-animal. High levels of pollen limitation were identified in three species at four of the 34 study sites. Moderate to high levels of pollen limitation were evident in 50% of the gender dimorphic populations compared with 31% of hermaphroditic populations. Melicope simplex populations were female-biased in 14 study plots and successful fruit set was influenced by combinations of male plant density, male flower numbers and distance to the nearest pollen. Natural fruit set in wind-pollinated species was generally higher than in animal-pollinated taxa. Populations of Coprosma spathulata were mostly malebiased, and male plant density and proximity influenced natural fruit set, with a correlation between low fruit set and low male density. Population recruitment was evident in 32 of the 34 sites. In Pimelea arenaria, recruitment failure was widespread in populations throughout the North Island despite high seed set. Gender ratios showed variation from north to south, with a lower proportion of females with increasing latitude. Many of the sixteen shrubs in this study show remarkable resilience to the effects of fragmentation of natural ecosystems, and many of the species have benefited from the creation of new edge habitat after perturbation - it may be that edges are important refugia for some native taxa, especially shrubs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand native shrubs</field><field name="subject">Pollination</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1508</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capacity building for school improvement : a case study of a New Zealand primary school : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Patricia</field><field name="description">Capacity building is now mentioned synonymously with school improvement in much of the literature. However, research on the topic is limited (Hadfield, Chapman, Curryer and Barrett, 2004) and generally undertaken at the micro level of school functioning. There is an absence of debate on political, economic and social trends with implications for capacity building (Muijs, Harris, Chapman, Stoll &amp; Russ, 2004; Thrupp &amp; Willmott, 2003; Gray, 2000). Hopkins, Beresford and West (1998) claim the concept lacks clear articulation and definition. This inquiry explores capacity building for school improvement in one low decile, multicultural, New Zealand primary school. This research is framed by four aims: to undertake an investigation on processes that enhance improvement, namely, capacity building for school improvement; to define capacity building; to conduct an in-depth study of influences (external and internal) on capacity building for school improvement; and to record the journey of one school in building capacity for improvement. The inquiry is positioned within an interpretivist paradigm, employs a case study approach and grounded theory methods for data analysis and interpretation. Research questions that guide this investigation are: How is capacity for school improvement defined - what are its features? How do internal school factors - vision, stakeholder activity, culture and professional development - evolve capacity? In what ways do external wider societal factors influence the development of capacity? What links exist between capacity building and improvement as evidenced in this school setting? Data suggests that capacity building for school improvement is time and context dependent. Its conceptualisation is unique to setting. Capacity building for school improvement is a response to meeting individual, collective and systemic needs in ways that sustain equilibrium while moving in the direction of improvement. Attributes inherent in its construction are vision, stakeholders as change agents, school culture and professional development. The main practices are: knowledge production and utilisation; switching-on mentality; and division of labour: roles and responsibilities. From attributes and practices emerge four themes: situated activity; connectedness; leadership, governance and management; and outcomes. Attributes, practices and themes explain capacity building for school improvement in one setting. The capacity of an organisation, to manage tensions and address need, ensures individual, collective and systemic equilibrium while moving in the direction of improvement</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School improvement</field><field name="subject">New Zealand schools</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1509</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance in the Indonesian state-owned enterprises : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Indreswari, Meidyah</field><field name="description">Concern regarding corporate governance is a new phenomenon in Indonesia. It became apparent in the business community when the economic crisis hit the country in 1997. Due to its recent recognition, it appears that very little is known about corporate governance in Indonesia and there has been no academic study conducted on corporate governance in the Indonesian Stateowned Enterprises (ISOEs) despite the fact that their performance is closely linked to the development of the country. The main objectives of this study are two-fold: first is to examine corporate governance systems and the roles of the Boards of ISOEs; and second is to assess the effectiveness of government initiatives in improving corporate governance practices in ISOEs. This study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative analysis was derived from numerical data obtained from government reports and other public documents. The qualitative analysis was based on the results of in-depth interviews with key individuals and other sources such as public opinions published in the mass media. Several key findings were obtained from the results of this study. Firstly, the study found that using agency theory to explain the relationships between the agents and the principals was more problematic in ISOEs than those in private enterprises. This is because an ISOE is a loose coalition of various agents with no real owner. Consequently. agency theory, if it is used to redefine the relationships among parties in ISOEs. should be approached at two different levels. At the micro level the agency theory examines the agent-principal relationships among the ISOE management, the Boards and the government-the corporate governance tripod. At the macro level it examines the agent-principal relationships between the corporate governance tripod and the ISOEs stakeholders (the public, labour unions, politicians in the People's Representative Assembly and others). Secondly, the results of this study confirm the results of previous studies which found that Boards in SOEs were largely ineffective. To enhance Boards' effectiveness, this study suggests that as a quasi-owner the government needs to reduce its intervention in ISOEs' operations and empower the Boards by establishing employee representation on the Board. In addition, Board training and assessment should be a mandatory in the ISOEs. Thirdly, this study found that the initiatives on corporate governance carried out by the Indonesian government had been ineffective due to the lack of incentives, lack of commitment and consistency, lack of understanding of corporate governance and unclear programmes. Here, the key factor required to enhance effectiveness is strong-willed commitment of the government and ISOE management. Lastly, other factors such as culture, public governance and law enforcement have a great influence in the process of attaining good corporate governance practices. Therefore, there should be joint efforts among parties in the public sector to ensure that good corporate governance is achieved in conjunction with the attainment of good public governance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State owned enterprises</field><field name="subject">Government corporations</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Indonesian government</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360202 Public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1510</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and implementation of HTS technology for cellular base stations : an investigation into improving cellular communication : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand, and James Cook University, Townsville, Australia</field><field name="creator">Knack, Adrian</field><field name="description">When placed between the antenna and receiver electronics of a cellular base transceiver station, a Cryogenic Receiver Front End (CRFE), consisting of a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) filter and modern Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), can significantly improve the base stations' coverage and capacity. Due to CRFEs being hurried to the telecommunications industry in a competitive market, the development of CRFEs and their performance have been classified. This left it to be pondered whether HTS filters could really have been beneficial or if they were always just of academic interest. It is the main objective of this thesis to investigate if and under what circumstances high temperature RF-superconductivity can prove to be an important technological contribution to current and future wireless communications. This dissertation presents the analysis of an existing CRFE developed by Cryoelectra GmbH and its performance characteristics measured in a field trial held in rural China. With the aid of a CDMA Uplink Model developed by the author, the data was analysed and several novel engineering improvements were made to create an advanced CRFE which was economical to deploy. The analysis of results from a field trial in Beijing city using the CDMA Uplink Model led to the exploration of alternative filter technologies which could achieve similar results to the HTS filter technology. This culminated in the development of dielectric resonators filters which could be used as an alternative and as a supplement to the HTS filters used in the CRFE. The design of two novel dielectric resonator duplexers and two advanced multioperator combiner antenna sharing solutions followed the successful implementation of a high performance dielectric resonator filter. The performed investigation and development described in this thesis suggest that HTS filter technology for terrestrial wireless communications can be beneficial in current cellular networks, but due to its high cost is economical for use only under certain conditions. However, HTS filter technology may be of great importance in the design and implementation of spectrum friendly wireless communications systems in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High temperature superconductors</field><field name="subject">Radio</field><field name="subject">Transmitter-receivers</field><field name="subject">Wireless communications systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1511</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of condensed tannin and fresh forage diets on the formation of indole and skatole in the rumen and on the pastoral odour and flavour of sheep meat : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schreurs, Nicola Maria</field><field name="description">Flavour is a factor that has a large influence on meat quality. Pastoral flavour that results from the grazing of pasture is an undesirable characteristic of meat flavour for consumers more accustomed to meat produced by grain and concentrate feeding systems. In New Zealand there is a reliance on grazing systems for sheep meat production, however the resulting meat flavour is one factor that impedes the increase of sheep meat exports to discerning markets. Correlation of chemical analyses to sensory evaluations of sheep meat has identified that a high concentration of indole and skatole in the fat is associated with pastoral flavours. Indole and skatole are formed in the rumen from the microbial fermentation of tryptophan. New Zealand pasture is high in protein, which is both highly soluble and rapidly degraded in the rumen. As such, pasture diets provide a rich and ready source of tryptophan for the formation of indole and skatole in the rumen. Condensed tannins are known to slow the degradation of protein in the rumen. Therefore, one of the objectives of this study was to establish if dietary condensed tannin can reduce the ruminal biogenesis of indole and skatole and consequently, ameliorate pastoral flavour in sheep meat. White clover usually comprises up to 30% of the botanical composition of pastures in New Zealand, is highly degradable in the rumen and likely to result in a high availability of tryptophan in the rumen for conversion to indole and skatole. Therefore, another objective of this study was to determine if feeding white clover gave a significant increase in the formation of indole and skatole in the rumen compared to perennial ryegrass and if this has an effect on pastoral flavour in meat. These hypotheses were tested using a series of in vitro rumen fermentations that incorporated the use of fresh forages (Chapter 3 and 6). In vivo experiments were utilised to assess rumen formation of indole and skatole with different forages (Chapter 4) and to assess effects of dietary condensed tannin (CT; Chapter 5 and 7). Meat and fat samples from lambs used in Chapters 5 and 7 underwent sensory evaluation to determine if forage or CT treatments were having an effect on the fat odour or meat flavour. From the in vitro and in vivo experiments of (Chapter 3, 4, 6 and 7) it was calculated that the formation of indole and skatole with perennial ryegrass is generally only 6-41% of that formed with white clover. A higher concentration of indole and skatole was also observed in the blood plasma of lambs that were fed white clover compared to those that were fed perennial ryegrass (Chapter 7) and white clover gave an overall more intense flavour in the meat. Comparison of forages fermented in vitro (Chapter 3) showed that with forage legumes of a higher CT concentration, such as Lotus pedunculatus (98 gCT kg-1 DM) and Dorycnium rectum (122 gCT kg-1 DM), the indole and skatole formed was only 7-21% of that formed with white clover. With forages of an intermediate CT concentration such as sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) and Lotus corniculatus the indole and skatole concentration formed was 53-68% of that of white clover. From in vitro rumen fermentation of mixtures of white clover and Lotus pedunculatus it was concluded that the CT in Lotus pedunculatus was not reacting with the protein in white clover. Fermentation of fresh white clover in the presence of an increasing concentration of added CT extract showed that at a higher CT, indole and skatole formation were reduced to low levels. It was inferred that this was due to optimal protein binding and the availability of free condensed tannin to bind other sources of protein, including rumen microbes. However, in vivo dosing with a CT extract resulted in only a small reduction in rumen indole and skatole concentration. This indicated that when CT was dosed into the in vivo rumen of lambs fed fresh forages the CT probably passed from the rumen before adequate protein release from the forage had taken place. Thus, in the grazing situation it will be optimal to provide CT in planta to maximise protein binding and this, in combination with the high CT concentration needed (approximately 80 gCT kg-1 DM), makes Lotus pedunculatus or Dorycnium rectum the prime candidates for further grazing trials into pastoral flavour amelioration using CT forages. Grazing Lotus corniculatus (40 gCT kg-1 DM) in a field experiment resulted in a lower rumen and blood plasma and fat concentration of indole and skatole in comparison to the grazing of perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture. However, a change in the pastoral odour of the fat was not perceived by the sensory panel when comparing fat samples from lambs that had grazed Lotus corniculatus and perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture. The concentration of skatole in the body fat was less variable in the lambs that had grazed Lotus corniculatus and resulted in no lambs with a high outlying concentration (&gt;100 ng g-1) of indole and skatole. This finding holds some potential for reducing pastoral flavour for consumers sensitive to high indole and skatole concentration in the fat. When condensed tannin was dosed to lambs that were fed white clover or perennial ryegrass in the form of a grape seed extract the intermittent supply of CT slightly reduced indole and skatole formation in the rumen and reduced the plasma concentration of indole and skatole. Flavour assessment of meat from the lambs fed white clover or perennial ryegrass with or without CT suggested that CT reduced the intensity of pastoral flavours. However, there were minimal effects on indole and skatole concentration in the body fat. It was possible that other pastoral flavour related compounds derived from the degradation of amino acids, in addition to indole and skatole that were measured, were having an effect on the meat flavour. It was concluded that dietary condensed tannin is able to reduce the formation of indole and skatole in the rumen and can alter the sensory attributes of sheep meat including reducing pastoral flavours. A higher CT concentration present within the forage plant (approximately 80 g kg-1 DM) will be best to minimise indole and skatole formation in the rumen and reduce pastoral flavours in the meat. Further research is required to confirm this in the grazing situation. Feeding white clover results in a greater rumen biogenesis of indole and skatole compared to perennial ryegrass and therefore, may be the primary contributor to pastoral flavours when ruminants graze conventional pastures. Further research is required to evaluate the flavour attributes that result from feeding white clover to meat producing ruminants in the New Zealand grazing situation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meat flavour</field><field name="subject">Sheep meat</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1512</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the predisposition of 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) to the physiological disorder, bunch stem necrosis : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Physiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pickering, Andrea Hilary</field><field name="description">Bunch stem necrosis (BSN) is a physiological disorder in grapes. It results in shrivelled berries with poor quality attributes such that wine produced from grapes with high BSN incidence is of compromised quality. Past research has proposed many different hypotheses to explain the disorder. Literature indicates that conditions during certain stages of development may predispose berries to BSN but results are not consistent as to which stage is the critical one or which factors have the most impact. This study was designed to resolve these points of uncertainty. Treatments that either enhanced or decreased vine vigour, or manipulated the light environment around the fruit zone were applied to field grown 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vines over three seasons. Treatments included root pruning, heading back of canes by 50%, laying down a reflective mulch and two 50% shade treatments applied for three weeks either pre- or post-full bloom (FB). A strong positive correlation was found between vine vigour and the incidence of BSN. Three weeks post-FB, during both the current and previous season, was identified as the critical period within which factors predispose bunches to BSN. Plant growth regulators, including GA3, IAA and NPA, were applied to bunches on a different group of field grown vines immediately after FB. Application of GA3 during the critical period, tended to reduce the incidence of BSN, while the effects of IAA and NPA application were less clear and require further research. In a controlled environment (CE) trial, pot-grown vines were placed in CE rooms during one of three development stages. Results showed that treatments applied during the critical threeweek period after FB increased the incidence of BSN three fold compared with no change in BSN incidence for vines that were placed in the CE rooms immediately prior to FB or prior to veraison. Collective results from these studies clearly demonstrate that the period immediately following FB is the most critical time in the predisposition of bunches to BSN. It is suggested that competitive dominance of vegetative growth over the developing inflorescence and bunch for assimilates and/or nutrients may be the predisposing factor/s influencing this disorder.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grape diseases</field><field name="subject">Grapevines</field><field name="subject">Viticulture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1513</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secular cooling of the solid Earth, emergence of the continents, and evolution of Earth's external envelopes</field><field name="creator">Flament, Nicolas</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosphy (Cotutelle)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geophysics</field><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6334</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecophysiology and phytoremediation potential of heavy metal(Loid) accumulating plants</field><field name="creator">Kachenko, Anthony</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="subject">Ferns</field><field name="subject">Gold dust fern</field><field name="subject">Hyperaccumulator</field><field name="subject">Nickel</field><field name="subject">Shrub violet</field><field name="subject">Tolerance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exercise in cystic fibrosis</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Tiffany Jane</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cystic fibrosis</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">exercise behaviour</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">mucus clearance</field><field name="subject">health outcomes</field><field name="subject">questionnaire</field><field name="subject">determinants of exercise participation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Problem of the 'Borderline States' in Regionalism: 'Rationalist' and 'Ideational' Approaches</field><field name="creator">Fjader, Christian Olof</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International Relations</field><field name="subject">Regionalism</field><field name="subject">East Asia</field><field name="subject">Asia-Pacific</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">Turkey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education and Incarceration: An Interpretive Study of Prisoners' Narratives</field><field name="creator">Bedford, Tasman Anthony</field><field name="description">The study had two aims. The first aim was to develop and present an understanding of the lived experience of selected individual prisoners relating to their formal education and vocational training. The second aim was to identify points of potential heuristic interest relating to ostensible needs for social action to reduce the incidence of juvenile and continuing engagement by individuals in criminal activities, and to address education and vocational training issues relating to the integration or reintegration of incarcerated offenders into the wider Australian society after their release from custody. A constructivist conceptual framework was adopted to guide the selection of the methodology of the study and the interpretation of the data obtained through implementation of the methodology. The methodology involved analysis of written transcripts of audio-recorded self-narratives of selected prisoners to generate the data used in the study. Prisoners from three Queensland correctional centres for adult males were selected for participation in the study primarily on the basis of their personal history of juvenile and continuing engagement in criminal offending principally associated with obtaining financial income, and their willingness to voluntarily participate. Participants&#146; self-narratives, relating principally to their lived experience of formal education and vocational training, were audio-recorded in individual, relatively unstructured interview sessions with the researcher. Written transcripts of the audio-recordings of interview sessions with a total of 15 participants were selected for analysis on the basis of their apparent relevance to the aims of the study. Two general types of narrative analysis methods were used to analyse the transcripts. The first of these was simple inspection of each transcript, which was used to identify categories of background information about the participants, including selected inferred general characteristics of such prisoners, and to identify instances of the content of these categories in individual cases. Inferred characteristics of prisoners were constructed from a review of literature relating to prisoners in Australia, and were selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of claimed relationships between people&#146;s experience of disadvantage during their juvenile years and their engagement in a criminal career which they began in their juvenile years...</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prison</field><field name="subject">incarceration</field><field name="subject">education in prison</field><field name="subject">vocational training in prison</field><field name="subject">juvenile crime</field><field name="subject">reintegration of offenders</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100730.084509</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a dehumidification / indirect evaporative cooling system using liquid desiccant /</field><field name="creator">Alizadeh, Shahaboddin</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhDManufacturing,MechanicEng)--University of South Australia, 2002.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Humidity</field><field name="subject">Solar air conditioning.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79232</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43610</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifting realities :</field><field name="creator">Aliukonis, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Thesis (MA)--University of South Australia, 1997</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technological innovations</field><field name="subject">Technology and civilization.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80115</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43357</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coded multiuser CDMA /</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Paul D</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 1996</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code division multiple access.</field><field name="subject">Error-correcting codes (Information theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83844</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43073</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the development of evaluation system and transport demand model for road network planning in developing countries :</field><field name="creator">Aldian, Amilia</field><field name="description">The road network is utilised daily by communities and plays an important role in the economic development and defence system of a nation. Transport planning is essential in road network development to assist decision makers in selecting alternatives to be considered and in explaining the reasons for selecting an alternative to the public. Evaluation and transport demand modelling are the basis of transport planning. In the evaluation step, alternatives are analysed in order to value the merit of alternatives and to decide when the selected alternative/s should be implemented. Transport demand modelling is applied to estimate the effects of alternatives on transport demand. The development of an evaluation system and transport demand model in this research accounts for several factors usually found in developing countries such as the lack of qualified professional planners and technical resources, reliability and availability of data, and stability of land use structure and economic condition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Highway planning</field><field name="subject">Highway planning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79641</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44151</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specialist clinical pharmacy services in the care of patients with psychiatric illness: an assessment of the contribution to optimal health outcomes and implications for pharmacy practice</field><field name="creator">Alderman, Christopher P</field><field name="description">Mental illnesses are very common.

Creating a timetable can take several weeks, and so the process usually stops once the first feasible timetable has been found. It is suspected that this timetable is often far from optimal. Existing methods schedule track maintenance once the best train timetable has been determined and allow little or no adjustments to the timetable. This approach almost certainly produces suboptimal integrated solutions since the track maintenance schedule is developed with the imposition of the previously constructed train timetable. The research in this thesis considers operationally feasible methods to produce integrated train timetables and track maintenance schedules so that, when evaluated according to key performance criteria, the overall schedule is the best possible. This research was carried out as part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Railway Engineering and Technologies. We developed a method that uses a local search meta-heuristic called 'problem space search'. A fast dispatch heuristic repeatedly selects and moves a track possessor (train or maintenance task) through the network; this results in a single integrated schedule. This technique generates a collection of alternative feasible schedules by applying the dispatch heuristic to different sets of randomly perturbed data. The quality of the schedules is then evaluated. Thousands of feasible solutions can be found within minutes. We also formulated an integer programming model that selects a path for each train and maintenance task from a set of alternatives. If all possible paths are considered, then the best schedule found is guaranteed to be optimal. To reduce the size of the model, we explored a reduction technique called 'branch and price'. The method works on small example problems where paths are selected from a predetermined set, but the computation time and memory requirements mean that the method is not suitable for realistic problems. The main advantages of the problem space search method are generality and speed. We are able to model the operations of a variety of rail networks due to the representation of the problem. The generated schedules can be ranked with a user-defined objective measure. The speed at which we produce a range of feasible integrated schedules allows the method to be used in an operational setting, both to create schedules and to test different scenarios. A comparison with simulated current practice on a range of test data sets reveals improvements in total delay of up to 22%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="subject">Heuristics</field><field name="subject">Integer programming</field><field name="subject">Train timetabling</field><field name="subject">Railway track maintenance scheduling</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/50708</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:37507</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for teaching senior secondary visual arts in a digital world /</field><field name="creator">Aland, Jenny</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 2004.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Computer art</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80633</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43864</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic characterisation of surface-immobilised antibacterial furanone coatings /</field><field name="creator">Al-Bataineh, Sameer</field><field name="description">This thesis project focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, protein interactions, and antibacterial effectiveness of coatings bearing covalently immobilized furanone compounds.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibacterial agents.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81812</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44272</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arsenic speciation and toxicity in biological systems /</field><field name="creator">Akter, Kazi Farzana</field><field name="description">Arsenic contamination of groundwater has been reported in over 20 countries worldwide where tens of millions of people are being exposed to excessive levels of arsenic in their drinking water, especially in countries of the Asian region, Bangladesh in particular.

It is hoped that such tests could provide a unique and important addition to the range of tests currently employed by researchers interested in these constructs. The results of five separate studies are presented across three published papers. In Paper 1-Study 1 (N = 49) a speeded computerized coding test (Symbol Digit) using the mouse as the response device was assessed. Because speeded tests are thought to be highly sensitive to response methods (Mead &amp; Drasgow, 1994) it was deemed important to first assess how a mouse response method might affect the underlying construct validity of a speeded coding test independently of whether it was game-like. Factor analytic results indicated that the computerized coding test loaded strongly on the same factor as paper-andpencil measures of Gs. For Paper 2-Study 1 (N = 68) a more computer-game-like version of Symbol Digit was developed, Space Code. Development of Space Code involved the provision of a cover story, the replacing of code symbols with &#8216;spaceship&#8217; graphics, the situating of the test within an overall &#8216;spaceship cockpit&#8217;, and numerous other graphical and aural embellishments to the task. Factor analytic results indicated that Space Code loaded strongly on a Gs factor but also on a factor comprised of visuo-spatial (Gv) ability tests. This finding was further investigated in the subsequent study. Paper 2-Study 2 (N = 74) involved a larger battery of ability marker tests and a range of additional computer-game-like elements were added to Space Code. Space Code included a scoring system, a timer with additional voice synthesized countdowns, aversive feedback for errors, and background music. Factor analysis indicated that after a general factor was extracted Space Code loaded on the same factor as paper-and-pencil measures of Gs and did not load on a factor comprised of non-speeded Gv tests. Paper 3-Study 1 (N = 74) was aimed at assessing a computer-game-like test of WM (Space Matrix) and further assessing Space Code within a broader network of tests. Space Matrix used a dual task format combining a simple version of Space Code with a visually presented memory task based on the Dot Matrix test (Miyake, Friedman, Rettinger, Shah, &amp; Hegarty, 2001). The cover story and scoring system for Space Code was expanded to incorporate this additional memory element. Factor analysis indicated that Space Matrix was loaded on the same first order factor as standard WM tests and the Raven&#8217;s Advanced Progressive Matrices (Gf). Space Code was substantially loaded on the second order factor but was weakly loaded on each of two first order factors interpreted as Gs and WM/Gf. A final study is presented (Paper 3-Study2) in which Space Code and Space Matrix was administered to a school aged sample (N=94). Space Matrix exhibited construct validity as well as predictive validity (as a predictor of school grades), while results for Space Code were less encouraging. Space Matrix and Raven&#8217;s Progressive Matrices showed comparable relationships to school grades for Mathematics, English and Science subjects. It is concluded that the development of computer-game-like tests represents a promising new format for research and applied assessment of known cognitive abilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive abilities; computer games; computer-game-like; computerised assessment; CHC; intelligence; psychological assessment</field><field name="subject">Cognition Testing.</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the tectonic framework of the Musgrave Province, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Wade, Benjamin P.</field><field name="description">The importance of the Musgrave Province in continental reconstructions of Proterozoic Australia is only beginning to be appreciated. The Mesoproterozoic Musgrave Province sits in a geographically central location within Australia and is bounded by older and more isotopically evolved regions including the Gawler Craton of South Australia and Arunta Region of the Northern Territory. Understanding the crustal growth and deformation mechanisms involved in the formation of the Musgrave Province, and also the nature of the basement that separates these tectonic elements, allows for greater insight into defining the timing and processes responsible for the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. The ca. 1.60-1.54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss preserves geochemical and isotopic signatures related to ongoing arc-magmatism in an active margin between the North Australian and South Australian Cratons (NAC and SAC). Characteristic geochemical patterns of the Musgravian Gneiss include negative anomalies in Nb, Ti, and Y, and are accompanied by steep LREE patterns. Also characteristic of the Musgravian Gneiss is its juvenile Nd isotopic composition (&#603;Nd1.55 values from -1.2 to +0.9). The juvenile isotopic signature of the Musgravian Gneiss separates it from the bounding comparitively isotopically evolved terranes of the Arunta Region and Gawler Craton. The geochemical and isotopic signatures of these early Mesoproterozoic felsic rocks have similarities with island arc systems involving residual Ti-bearing minerals and garnet. Circa 1.40 Ga metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province also record vital evidence for determining Australia.s location and fit within a global plate reconstruction context during the late Mesoproterozoic. U-Pb detrital zircon and Sm-Nd isotopic data from these metasedimentary rocks suggests a component of derivation from sources outside of the presently exposed Australian crust. Best fit matches come from rocks originating from eastern Laurentia. Detrital zircon ages range from Palaeoproterozoic to late Mesoproterozoic, constraining the maximum depositional age of the metasediments to approximately 1.40 Ga, similar to that of the Belt Supergroup in western Laurentia. The 1.49-1.36 Ga detrital zircons in the Musgrave metasediments are interpreted to have been derived from the voluminous A-type suites of Laurentia, as this time period represents a &#8220;magmatic gap&#8221; in Australia, with an extreme paucity of sources this age recognized. The metasedimentary rocks exhibit a range of Nd isotopic signatures, with &#603;Nd(1.4 Ga) values ranging from -5.1 to 0.9, inconsistent with complete derivation from Australian sources, which are more isotopically evolved. The isotopically juvenile ca. 1.60-1.54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss is also an excellent candidate for the source of the abundant ca. 1.6-1.54 Ga detrital zircons within the lower sequences of the Belt Supergroup. If these interpretations are correct, they support a palaeogeographic reconstruction involving proximity of Australia and Laurentia during the pre-Rodinia Mesoproterozoic. This also increases the prospectivity of the eastern Musgrave Province to host a metamorphised equivalent of the massive Pb-Zn-Ag Sullivan deposit. The geochemical and isotopic signatures recorded in mafic-ultramafic rocks can divulge important information regarding the state of the sub continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The voluminous cumulate mafic-ultramafic rocks of the ca. 1.08 Ga Giles Complex record geochemical and Nd-Sr isotopic compositions consistent with an enriched parental magma. Traverses across three layered intrusions, the Kalka, Ewarara, and Gosse Pile were geochemically and isotopically analysed. Whole rock samples display variably depleted to enriched LREE patterns when normalised to chondrite ((La/Sm)N = 0.43-4.72). Clinopyroxene separates display similar depleted to enriched LREE patterns ((La/Sm)N = 0.37-7.33) relative to a chondritic source. The cumulate rocks display isotopically evolved signatures (&#603;Nd ~-1.0 to .5.0 and &#603;Sr ~19.0 to 85.0). Using simple bulk mixing and AFC equations, the Nd-Sr data of the more radiogenic samples can be modelled by addition of ~10% average Musgrave crust to a primitive picritic source, without need for an enriched mantle signature. Shallow decompressional melting of an asthenospheric plume source beneath thinned Musgravian lithosphere is envisaged as a source for the parental picritic magma. A model involving early crustal contamination within feeder zones is favoured, and consequently explorers looking for Ni-Cu-Co sulphides should concentrate on locating these feeder zones. Few absolute age constraints exist for the timing of the intracratonic Petermann Orogeny of the Musgrave Province. The Petermann Orogeny is responsible for much of the lithospheric architecture we see today within the Musgrave Province, uplifting and exhuming large parts along crustal scale E-W trending fault/shear systems. Isotopic and geochemical analysis of a suite of stratigraphic units within the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Officer Basin to the immediate south indicate the development of a foreland architecture at ca. 600 Ma. An excursion in &#603;Nd values towards increasingly less negative values at this time is interpreted as representing a large influx of Musgrave derived sediments. Understanding the nature of the basement separating the SAC from the NAC and WAC is vital in constructing models of the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. This region is poorly understood as it is overlain by the thick sedimentary cover of the Officer Basin. However, the Coompana Block is one place where basement is shallow enough to be intersected in drillcore. The previously geochronologically, geochemically, and isotopically uncharacterised granitic gneiss of the Coompana Block represents an important period of within-plate magmatism during a time of relative magmatic quiescence in the Australian Proterozoic. U-Pb LA-ICPMS dating of magmatic zircons provides an age of ca. 1.50 Ga, interpreted as the crystallisation age of the granite protolith. The samples have distinctive A-type chemistry characterised by high contents of Zr, Nb, Y, Ga, LREE with low Mg#, Sr, CaO and HREE. &#603;Nd values are high with respect to surrounding exposed crust of the Musgrave Province and Gawler Craton, and range from +1.2 to +3.3 at 1.5 Ga. The tectonic environment into which the granite was emplaced is also unclear, however one possibility is emplacement within an extensional environment represented by interlayered basalts and arenaceous sediments of the Coompana Block. Regardless, the granitic gneiss intersected in Mallabie 1 represents magmatic activity during the &#8220;Australian magmatic gap&#8221; of ca. 1.52-1.35 Ga, and is a possible source for detrital ca. 1.50 zircons found within sedimentary rocks of Tasmania and Antarctica, and metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology; Geomorphology; Geology, Structural; Paleontology--Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Historical geology Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Australia South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Australia Northern Territory.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic Proterozoic.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic Cambrian.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57768</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters.

The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bose-Einstein condensates in coupled co-planar double-ring traps : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masterate of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Tania J</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical study of Bose-Einstein condensates in a doublering trap. In particular, we determine the ground states of the condensate in the double-ring trap that arise from the interplay of quantum tunnelling and the trap&#8217;s rotation. The trap geometry is a concentric ring system, where the inner ring is of smaller radius than the outer ring and both lie in the same two-dimensional plane. Due to the difference in radii between the inner and outer rings, the angular momentum that minimises the kinetic energy of a condensate when confined in the individual rings is different at most frequencies. This preference is in direct competition with the tunnel coupling of the rings which favours the same angular momentum states being occupied in both rings. Our calculations show that at low tunnel coupling ground state solutions exist where the expectation value of angular momentum per atom in each ring differs by approximately an integer multiple. The energy of these solutions is minimised by maintaining a uniform phase difference around most of the ring, and introducing a Josephson vortex between the inner and outer rings. A Josephson vortex is identified by a 2p step in the relative phase between the two rings, and accounts for one quantum of circulation. We discuss similarities and differences between Josephson vortices in cold-atom systems and in superconducting Josephson junctions. Josephson vortices are actuated by a sudden change in the trapping potential. After this change Josephson vortices rotate around the double-ring system at a different frequency to the rotation of the double-ring potential. Numerical studies of the dependence of the velocity on the ground state tunnel coupling and interaction strength are presented. An analytical theory of the Josephson vortex dynamics is also presented which is consistent with our numerical results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Josephson vortex</field><field name="subject">tunnel coupling</field><field name="subject">superconductivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240200 Theoretical and Condensed Matter Physics::240203 Condensed matter physics-electronic and magnetic properties, superconductivity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/975</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The platforms : an examination of New Zealand Special Air Service campaigns from Borneo 'confrontation' to the Vietnam War, 1965-1971 : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Defence and Strategic Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand EMBARGOED until 31 January 2012</field><field name="creator">Ball, Rhys</field><field name="description">In 1955, the New Zealand Government authorised the creation of a Special Forces unit to operate with British counterparts in Malaya to defeat a communist-inspired guerrilla insurgency. Between 1956 and 1971 elements of the New Zealand Special Air Service (SAS) were deployed on active service four times. These operational deployments included periods of time in Malaya, Thailand, Borneo and South Vietnam. The research illustrates the chronological progression of the New Zealand SAS through two of its most influential active service campaigns by examining how commitments to the Borneo &#8216;Confrontation&#8217; in 1965 and 1966 directly and indirectly influenced the deployment to South Vietnam between December 1968 and February 1971. The mission of the New Zealand SAS in South Vietnam was to &#8216;assist in providing long range reconnaissance patrols&#8217; that would support the larger infantry elements in defeating the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army enemy. New Zealand SAS soldiers participated in 169 Australian SAS patrols in South Vietnam. Of those, 137 were commanded by the New Zealanders themselves. The research describes what the New Zealand SAS encountered during nearly two and a half years in South Vietnam; from the tactical intensity associated with small five-man patrols often observing or contacting much larger enemy formations, to the uncompromising professional standards that were expected of all members regardless of situation or circumstances and the influences of experienced Patrol Commanders, and the frustrations and inflexibility which characterised the relationship with their Australian counterparts. The research also further examines the underlying issue of overall strategic success and value of a small nationally-identifiable and strongly independent military unit that was compelled to operate under the command of larger Special Forces coalition counterparts and the impact different political, doctrinal, tactical cultural and cognitive characteristics had on these joint-operational deployments. The size of the New Zealand SAS contribution to the Australian SAS Squadron combined with the command arrangements placed upon it, also dictated that the deployments were never likely to be able to exert influence in any &#8216;independent&#8217; or nationally-identifiable sense, and the relationships, the types of patrol operations conducted, and the value of these operations, would ultimately see many New Zealand SAS veterans largely dissatisfied with the overall performance of the deployment. Nevertheless, the strength of New Zealand SAS operations in South Vietnam came from its practical application of unique New Zealand Special Forces methodology and field-craft which had been fundamentally shaped and developed in Borneo. The New Zealand SAS operations in South Vietnam and Borneo - the demonstration of the highest standards of patrol techniques, tracking, reconnaissance, ambushing and fire discipline, and above all, operational professionalism that has been the hallmark of New Zealand's military history &#8211; provided the evolutionary &#8216;platforms&#8217; from which today&#8217;s highly skilled and enviable New Zealand Special Forces have emerged.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Special Air Service</field><field name="subject">New Zealand SAS</field><field name="subject">Malaya</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Borneo</field><field name="subject">South Vietnam</field><field name="subject">military history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360204 Defence studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nestling mortality in a translocated population of hihi/stitchbirds (Notiomystis cincta) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rippon, Rosemary Jane</field><field name="description">Nestling mortality in a reintroduced population of the endangered and endemic hihi/stitchbird (Notiomystis cincta) was investigated over one breeding season (2008-09) at Zealandia &#8211; Karori Sanctuary, New Zealand, to determine whether disease impacted on nestling survival. High rates of both hatching failure (56%) and nestling mortality (39%) in the first clutch made this the least successful breeding season since translocation in 2005. Overall 34% of eggs survived to fledge, compared to 52% and 58% in 2005-06 and 2006-07 respectively. Samples collected from 34 live and 25 dead nestlings were screened for evidence of disease. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were isolated from gastrointestinal swabs but there was no evidence of coccidia or other intestinal parasites in faecal samples. There was no evidence of significant abnormalities in the blood collected from hihi prior to fledging in the haematological parameters tested, and all blood samples were negative for malarial parasites. Tropical fowl mites (Ornithonyssus bursa) were found on nestlings and recovered from nest material in very small numbers. Sixty percent of nestling mortality occurred during the first 7 days of life, most often caused by starvation (16%) or poor pulmonary aeration (20%), and death was associated with seasonally low minimum daily temperatures below 11oC. Two older nestlings that died suffered from aspergillosis and an unidentified haemoparasite respectively. Seven nestlings (28%) aged 6-19 days died as a consequence of ventriculitis due to traumatic penetration by insect remnants identified as bee or wasp stings (Hymenoptera). The resulting granulomatous lesions were found in the gizzard mucosa, muscle layers and ventricular or intestinal serosa, and were associated with bacterial and/or yeast secondary infection. It was concluded that hihi may lack the evolutionary adaptations to safely consume introduced bees (Apis mellifera) and wasps (Vespula germanica, V. vulgaris) that are attracted to the feeding stations used to support reintroduced hihi populations. Histopathological examination showed candidiasis contributed to the deaths of four nestlings and Candida albicans was isolated from the gastrointestinal swabs of 13 live nestlings from four nest sites, eight of which survived to fledge. The potential of all pathogens may be increased by any cause of temporary or permanent immunosuppression and, in this establishing population, the majority of nestling deaths were associated with environmental conditions (temperature) and ecological factors (introduced prey). It is suggested that ongoing monitoring should include use of temperature data-loggers in hihi nest boxes, health screening of live nestlings, necropsy examination of dead birds, and spore counts to determine environmental levels of Aspergillus. Nest box insulation and/or heating could reduce the incidence of hypothermia in nestlings. A review of the carbohydrate provisioning protocols may reduce bee/wasp numbers and minimise the effect of Candida albicans at this site.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diseases in birds</field><field name="subject">Bird deaths</field><field name="subject">Native bird survival</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1514</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How corporate strategy contributes to firm performance : a cross-sectional study of resource governance decision making in US firms : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Strategic Management at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Monroe, Sondra Athene</field><field name="description">Corporate strategy has been a neglected topic in both theoretical and empirical discussions on superior firm performance. In addition to using competitive strategy to attain sustainable competitive advantage, firms should also focus on achieving a corporate level measure of performance, namely, persistent superior firm performance. The resource based theory paradigm suggests that factors which lead to superior firm performance are largely endogenous to the firm. Corporate strategy is one such factor. Empirical evidence has shown that corporate strategy matters. It has a small but significant influence on the variance of both business unit performance and firm performance. This research extends current knowledge by determining, firstly, if corporate strategy could be used to distinguish successful firms from nonsuccessful firms and, secondly, if so, how does corporate strategy actually influence firm performance. Fifteen Fortune 1000 US firms were categorised into three subpopulations based on persistent superior, average and inferior levels of performance. Eighteen indicators representing both excellence in corporate strategy and the incidence of corporate strategy were collected through the content analysis of Wall Street Journal articles from 1980 to 2004. Various inferential statistical techniques were conducted to provide a broad profile of findings. The frequency of resource governance decisions was found to distinguish the persistent superior firm performance category from both the persistent average and inferior firm performance categories. The corporate level decision making skill perspective provides an explanation for this empirical evidence. Superior performing firms, through the use of superior corporate level decision making skills, are able to simplify resource governance decision making (e.g., decision making rules). This simplification results in superior resource governance decisions being made, lowering the incidence of resource governance decisions. This research extends resource based theory by providing empirical evidence of the importance of resource governance decisions in achieving persistent superior firm performance. This research also integrates the concept of superior corporate level decision making skills into existing resource based theory. The research has implications also for both theoretical and practitioner literatures as it redefines corporate strategy. It shows that corporate strategy matters to firm performance, and importantly, it shows why corporate strategy matters.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business performance</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1515</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prospects for sustainable crop production technologies in East Timor : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Natural Resource Management, Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Viegas, Edmunda da Silva Soares</field><field name="description">The prospects of sustainable crop production technologies in East Timor were discerned with relevant case studies and experimental data. An overview of the agricultural development in East Timor with particular emphasis on the traditional farming and cropping systems was presented complemented by the discussion on the aspects of agricultural mechanization and technological change and their socioeconomic ramifications on food security. Empirical data from tillage trials, established both in East Timor and New Zealand, were gathered and discussed in the quest for a better understanding of tillage effects on soil structure and crop production environment. The agro-climatic zones of East Timor provide a well-defined set of ecological boundaries upon which further collaborative research work can be developed. Given land resources as one of the major capital investments in agriculture development, the drive towards improvement and technical change in agriculture should be directed in a balanced combination, whenever appropriate, between technologies of land-saving (hybrid seeds, irrigation, and drainage) or labour-saving (mechanization, herbicides, varieties and cropping techniques) characteristics. Moreover, the justification for acquiring an improved technology for traditional farmers, to some extent, needs to conform to the features of their subsistence mode of farming. The emphasis in technology dissemination, therefore, will have to shift from communication to education. Experimental results of this study on the effects of tillage, and no-tillage in Particular as a form of conservation tillage, on the edaphic changes affecting cropping environment generally concur with the findings known in the literature. Organic carbon levels are generally restored with cropping in East Timor. In addition, soil bulk density and crop grain and biomass yield were not affected by tillage treatments. Soil compaction was significantly affected by tillage as shown by data from the Palmerston North experiment. Soil aggregate stability in the 0-10 cm topsoil was similar under all the tillage treatments. Manual tillage (MT) had the greatest number of soil aggregates on sieve after a 30-minute wet-sieving (68.3%) followed by no-tillage (NT) (65.1), permanent pasture (PP) (62.6) and conventional tillage (CT) (56.5). Similarly, the top 0-10 cm soil under MT had significantly larger macroporosity (16.4%) than CT (9.23), NT (11.5), and PP (10.6). MT and CT significantly reduced the total C whereas N levels were significantly decreased by tillage (CT, MT and NT) compared to permanent pasture at the top 0-10 cm soil layer. Barley grain and biomass were unaffected by tillage whereas potato tuber yield and biomass were significantly less under no-tillage. Conventional tillage significantly increased water runoff but produced less leachate compared to no-till and permanent pasture. Total soil sediment loss was significantly lower under PP (95.8 kg/ha) and NT (132.9) compared to CT (3556.7) and MT (4652.2). pH of water runoff was significantly reduced under tillage treatments compared to that from permanent pasture whereas nitrogen losses were unaffected. There are at least four major public policy components that will play vital roles in the development of sustainable crop production technologies in East Timor: (i) Agricultural research and development (ii) Agricultural extension (iii) International and regional networking (iv) Shift of policy focus. The policy approach needs to be decentralized and broad-based and conservation agriculture should be promoted as opposed to conventional production agriculture. Three major areas for the future research agenda include: (i) Integrated Farming Systems (ii) Soil tillage and erosion (iii) Applied science and technology. The last component may cover disciplines such as: food policy analysis, farm machinery selection and testing, soil testing and mapping, land evaluation and GIs, bio-energy technologies, improved local seed varieties, adaptive fodder crops for improved grazing and pasture management, appropriate agro-forestry and soil and water conservation technologies and cash crop initiatives.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural development</field><field name="subject">Agricultural technology</field><field name="subject">Tillage</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1516</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of poplar stand density on hill country pastures : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wall, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Page xvi is missing from both the electronic and print copy</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300104 Land capability and soil degradation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1517</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Nursing Home Care Processor: An Ethnographic Study</field><field name="creator">Chien, Hui-Wen</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian nursing home care</field><field name="subject">Aged care</field><field name="subject">Ethnographic study</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Care processor</field><field name="subject">Aged care acceditation system</field><field name="subject">Assistant in Nursing, AIN</field><field name="subject">Registered Nurse</field><field name="subject">Participant observation</field><field name="subject">Indepth interview</field><field name="subject">Care outcome</field><field name="subject">Clinical aged care nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6389</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social capital and social entrepreneurship : Analysing links and implications for sustainability in third sector organisations in West Bengal</field><field name="creator">Basu, Saswati</field><field name="description">The theory of social capital attracts considerable attention across diversified fields due to its positive impact on society. A major portion of social capital literature is devoted to defining the concept and identifying the sources and factors that contribute to social capital development. Putnam (1993), the major proponent of this theory, defined social capital as the trust, norms and networks that facilitate coordinated action and improve the efficiency of society. He considered voluntary organisations to be a significant source of social capital as they encourage the trust-based relationships required for collective action. Many authors argued that social capital development is context specific. Krishna (2002) found that in a poor socio-economic context, social entrepreneurs acting as mediators can activate social capital and bring development. Social entrepreneurs act as catalysts to social change (Alvord et al. 2004), but limited studies have focused on their role in voluntary organisations in developing social capital. The present research analyses the activities of social entrepreneurs who assist in building and strengthening social capital among villagers as a part of the development process, and the implications of these activities for organisational sustainability. The activities of two types of social entrepreneurs, outsiders (SEETOs) and insiders (non- SEETOs) have been analysed. The research used a qualitative design and case study approach to investigate multiple levels of analysis within the single study. The case study organisations are five rural voluntary organisations from the state of West Bengal, India &#8212; three with SEETOs and two with non-SEETOs. Primary data have been collected during 2007 and 2008 through face-to-face interviews, published materials, photographs and participant observations. The findings of this research indicate that the development of social capital is dependent on the &#8216;enabling&#8217; leadership style of social entrepreneurs. The &#8216;enabling&#8217; leaders played an important role in transforming an organisation into a learning organisation and developed the villagers&#8217; organisational ability or social agency (an element of social capital) as a group to solve their own problems. The learning organisation ensures organisational sustainability. The study also observed the &#8216;benevolent dictator&#8217; leadership style. The &#8216;benevolent dictator&#8217; failed to create a learning organisation, and so the villagers had no organizational ability or social agency, which then placed organisational sustainability at risk. However, both types of leader played positive and effective roles in improving the lives of poor villagers. The research confirmed the social entrepreneur&#8217;s role in social capital development in voluntary organisations within a poor socio-economic context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1126</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competecy-based training and assessment in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Curwood, Maurice Robert</field><field name="description">Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of Federal Government papers and major reports called for changes and improvement in the skills formation of the Australian workforce, in an attempt to create a highly skilled and flexible workforce.

This study uses stochastic distance function approach to capture the role of institutions in explaining the efficiency differences across 70 countries. The empirical analysis reveals that policy stability in the form of substantive checks and balances on executive power is the most important aspect for successful reform. Independently, legal integrity improves telecommunications efficiency through privatization, while greater freedom from corruption influences the effectiveness of a regulatory body.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">efficiency, distance functions, telecommunications</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8552</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous self-determination and early childhood education and care in Victoria</field><field name="creator">Lopez, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how Victoria&#8217;s early childhood community negotiates colonial constructions of Aboriginality around dualisms such as Indigenous/non Indigenous and intersecting constructions of the child as ignorant or innocent of race and power both in concert and conflict with the non Indigenous early childhood community.

The development of this cell selection system benefited the isolation of chlorsulfuron-resistant variants from an elite asparagus genotype. A cell culture system, suitable for somatic cell selection, was established for asparagus genotype CRD 168. Friable callus was initiated from etiolated shoots in darkness and used to produce a high density of single cells in suspension. Cell density was estimated based on a linear relationship with settled cell volume. A mean plating efficiency of 0.19 % was recorded between 1-4x10&#8309; cells/Petri dish.  In vitro cell selection techniques were developed to identify mutant asparagus cells with resistance to a sulfonylurea herbicide, chlorsulfuron. A few key aspects were important to achieve this: a cell culture system for cell selection was initially established; a toxic concentration for the complete growth inhibition of the wild type asparagus cells was defined; rare, resistant cell colonies were isolated and characterized; and chlorsulfuron-resistant plants were regenerated. From about 50 million cells, 165 cell colonies were isolated in the presence of 8 nM chlorsulfuron. Characterization of these selected cell colonies yielded 24 escapes, 98 unstable variants, and 43 stable-resistant variants. Callus cultures from 34 of these stable variants retained resistance following 11 months growth in the absence of the selection agent. Plants were regenerated from 36 of these stable herbicide-resistant variants.  Six of these chlorsulfuron-resistant variants were screened for their degree of resistance to chlorsulfuron, cross resistance to other acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibiting herbicides and AHAS enzyme activity. Cross resistance to imazamox was evident in four of the resistant variants, while lack of cross resistance to metsulfuron methyl was observed in all six resistant variants. A varying degree of resistance to chlorsulfuron was observed among the resistant variants. Both in the original and secondary callus, an uninhibited AHAS enzyme activity in all six resistant variants was recorded in the presence of high chlorsulfuron concentration (70-140 nM), compared to the total inhibition in the wild type.  One chlorsulfuron-resistant variant, R-45, was used to compare the biochemical and physiological basis of resistance with the wild type. The AHAS enzyme activity in the tissue culture and greenhouse foliage of R-45 was significantly higher in the presence of up to 280 nM chlorsulfuron compared with the wild type. Chlorsulfuron retention was considerably higher due to the reduction of epicuticular wax deposits on the foliage of R-45, in comparison with the wild type. Consequently, the resistant line absorbed at least 1.6 fold more chlorsulfuron than the wild type plants. Therefore, foliar application of 15 g a.i./ha Glean (commercial formulation of chlorsulfuron) produced typical symptoms of chlorosis in R-45, similar to the wild type, in the greenhouse plants.  Somatic cell selection was carried out using two elite asparagus genotypes, CRD 74 and Clone X. Of the 33 rare cell colonies isolated from Clone X, 22 unstable variants and 6 escapes were discarded. All five remaining resistant variants produced plants. One of the stable-resistant variants (Clone X-24) was evaluated for resistance to chlorsulfuron. Both in vitro shoot cultures and greenhouse-grown plants of Clone X-24 showed increased resistance to chlorsulfuron compared with the wild type. The AHAS enzyme activity in the foliar extracts also showed the presence of higher enzyme activity in Clone X-24.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AHAS enzyme</field><field name="subject">AHAS inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Asparagus officinalis L.</field><field name="subject">cell culture</field><field name="subject">cell plating</field><field name="subject">chlorsulfuron</field><field name="subject">cross resistance</field><field name="subject">elite genotypes</field><field name="subject">herbicide resistance</field><field name="subject">resistant variants</field><field name="subject">somatic cell selection</field><field name="subject">sulfonylurea</field><field name="subject">070602 - Horticultural Crop Improvement (Selection and Breeding)</field><field name="subject">0601 - Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1871</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the world sheepmeat market : implications for policy</field><field name="creator">Blyth, Nicola</field><field name="description">Notable structural changes have taken place in the world sheepmeat market over the 1960-80 period. Imports into the major consuming countries of the EEC are declining as a result of changing tastes, higher import barriers and other factors. World exports have steadily increased however, and sales diversified into a number of alternative, expanding markets. Little quantitative information exists on these markets. An econometric model was constructed to analyse the changes on a global basis. The model covers production, consumption and trade in the main importing and exporting regions over a twenty one year period. These components form a dynamic, simultaneous system which solves for the world price. It allows the impact of changes in any particular market to be evaluated in terms of the effect on other markets and international prices. Simulation analysis is employed to test the effects of various shocks to the market, and to evaluate the impacts of certain policy changes, such as those recently implemented in the EEC. The changes are assessed against a Base simulation, which also provides a forecast of the market situation through the 1980's. From the conclusions various policy implications are drawn with respect to NZ's exports.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheepmeat</field><field name="subject">econometric models</field><field name="subject">sheep industry</field><field name="subject">agricultural policy</field><field name="subject">agricultural trade</field><field name="subject">sheep production</field><field name="subject">international trade</field><field name="subject">policy implications</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340201 Agricultural economics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340400 Econometrics::340402 Econometric and statistical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1676</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of vitamin B&#8321;&#8322; metabolism in sheep</field><field name="creator">Gruner, Tini Maria</field><field name="description">Vitamin B&#8321;&#8322; deficiency has been difficult to diagnose, mainly due to the vitamin's lack of biological significance in serum in which it is usually assayed. This research has investigated the marker of vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322;/cobalt (Co) deficiency in sheep, methylmalonic acid (MMA), in comparison with serum and liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in farm situations where vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; deficiency is expected in order to establish more accurate reference ranges for serum and liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322;, and MMA. In addition, an attempt was made to ascertain the vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; requirements of preruminant (PR) lambs, and to determine whether metabolic demand for vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; influences tissue concentrations. Furthermore, since the vitamin is active in biological tissues in form of its coenzymes, 5&#8217; -deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, a preliminary assessment of variation in the distribution of these coenzymes in liver in different situations has been sought.  The first trial was set up to find out if the addition of propionate to the PR lamb's diet stimulated the uptake and/or storage of vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; in the liver as a reflection of the need to deal with the incoming propionate. Sixteen ten day old lambs (Dorset Down/Coopworth cross-bred) were housed indoors soon after birth and fed on milk replacer. For half of the lambs 7.5 % (w:w) of the milk powder was replaced by propionate. Within each group, four lambs were treated with 250 &#181;g vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; twice weekly. Supplementation with vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; increased liver concentrations from ~250 to ~900 nmol/kg fresh tissue, but there was no effect of propionate. Propionate addition did, however, result in increased plasma vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; supplemented groups, values being 3323 and 2355 pmol/l in propionate supplemented and control groups, respectively. This suggested that diet could influence plasma vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations.  An attempt was made to quantify the PR lamb's ability to absorb vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; from the alimentary tract by comparing the ability of intra-muscular (IM) and oral vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; to raise plasma and liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations. Twenty-seven three to four day old lambs from a farm with marginal Co status were housed indoors and fed on milk replacer. They were divided into three groups: control (n=3), IM treatment (n=12) and oral treatment (n=12). The two treatment groups were further subdivided into five sub-groups. These received, respectively, 0.2 (n=3), 0.4 (n=2), 0.8 (n=2), 1.6 (n=2) and 3.2 &#181;g OH-cbl/d (n=3). The oral groups received tenfold the amount of the comparable IM groups, on the assumption that if oral absorption of the vitamin is about 10 % both groups would show similar increases in plasma and liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentration. None of the IM groups showed any significant change in plasma or liver vitamin B&#8321;&#8322;. In the oral groups only the group on the highest dose of vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322;, viz 32 &#181;g/d, showed increases in plasma and liver concentrations. It was concluded that either absorption of vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; was greater than 10 % or that the vitamin was retained better when administered orally. The amount retained in the livers of the lambs in the highest oral group was calculated to represent ~ 7.5 % of the dose.  In a follow-up 24 h trial, 14 of the above lambs were divided into three groups: Control (n=3), oral (n=6) and IM (n=5) treatment. The IM group received 3.2 &#181;g OH-cbl and the oral group tenfold the amount as single doses at 0800 h. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals throughout the 24 h period and assayed for vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322;, Vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in the IM group rose steeply within the first hour after injection to a concentration that was calculated to reflect 100 % uptake of the vitamin. It rose more slowly over about 8 h in the oral group. From the area under the curve absorption of the oral dose was estimated to be ~ 7 %.  The next experiment involved a farm where Co deficiency had been reported previously. In the first year, 50 pregnant two-tooth Half-bred ewes were divided randomly into two groups of 25. One group received a Co bullet plus 1000 &#181;g OH-cb1 IM, the other group remained unsupplemented. In the following year the trial was repeated. Ewes from the previous year's trial (by then four-tooths) were augmented by a new cohort of pregnant two-tooths to make up numbers to 75. After lambing the lambs were divided into four groups: first by their dams' vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; treatment, then half of each group received injections of vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; at approximately three weekly intervals while the other half remained untreated. The trials lasted about five months, from mid-pregnancy until weaning.  Pasture Co was at its lowest at lambing in both years, 0.09 and 0.10&#181;g/g DM, respectively. In the first year, vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in the untreated ewes rose from 340 to 950 pmol/l in plasma and decreased in liver from 330 to 170 nmol/kg fresh tissue. In the Co treated group, vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in plasma rose from 500 to 1550 pmol/l and in liver from 310 to 560 nmol/kg fresh tissue. In the second year, vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in serum in the unsupplemented groups fell from 500 to 260 pmol/l around lambing before rising again to starting values at weaning, and liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations fell from 450 at the start to 230 nmol/kg fresh tissue at the end of the trial. Serum vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in the two-tooth supplemented group rose from &lt; 500 to &gt; 3000 pmol/l whereas in the four-tooth supplemented group serum vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; levels started at ~2800 and rose to nearly 5000 pmol/l. The supplemented four-tooths maintained higher liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations throughout compared to the supplemented two-tooths, viz 680 compared to below 400 at the start and 900 versus 650 nmol/kg fresh tissue at weaning, respectively. MMA in the untreated groups rose to 15 and to 8 &#181;mol/l during early lactation in the first and second years, respectively, whereas MMA in the treated groups stayed below 3 &#181;mol/l in the first season and below 1.5 &#181;mol/l in the second season.  There was a live weight response to treatment in the ewes as the unsupplemented groups showed a significantly lower weight gain during the trials than the supplemented groups, viz 10.0 versus 13.6 kg in the first year, and 10.6 versus 13.3 kg in the four-tooths and 9.9 versus 12.1 kg in the two-tooths in the second year. There was also a significant difference in faecal egg count (FEC) in the first year. FEC in the untreated group was higher during lactation than in the treated group, viz 590 versus 170 eggs per gram wet faeces (epg), respectively. In the second year, the two-tooths had a higher FEC than the four-tooths, viz 120 versus 40 epg during the same time span, respectively. While there was a trend for treatment having an effect on FEC similar to that in the first year it was not significant. Supplementation of ewes in the first year increased mean milk vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations at lambing from 800 to 1400 pmol/l and at weaning from 1750 to 4000 pmol/l. In the second year, Co bullet treatment increased milk vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in the four-tooths and two-tooths from 1500 and 2300 to 4000 and 2900 pmol/l at lambing, and from 1800 and 1400 to 6200 and 4500 pmol/l at weaning, respectively.  Treatment of ewes increased vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in the lambs which were not themselves supplemented. Plasma values in the first year increased from 160 to 325 pmol/l soon after birth and from 650 to 900 pmol/l at weaning, and liver values from 75 to 140 nmol/kg fresh tissue soon after birth and from 150 to 240 nmol/kg fresh tissue at weaning. In the second year, plasma vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations increased from 160 to 380 pmol/l soon after birth and from 500 to 700 pmol/l at weaning, and in liver from 130 to 260 nmol/kg fresh tissue soon after birth and from 220 to 340 nmol/kg fresh tissue at weaning. There was also a significant effect of ewe supplementation on lamb MMA in 1997/1998 when values decreased from 19 to 8 &#181;mol/l around the time of rumen development. MMA in the second year stayed below 3 &#181;mol/l throughout in all groups of lambs. There was no difference in LWG between any groups of lambs. FEC was lowest in the group where both ewes and lambs were supplemented and highest in the group where neither ewes nor lambs were treated.  Further investigations were conducted on farms in Southland with lambs post-weaning in order to compare changes in serum and liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; with serum MMA and LWG to determine the critical time and level of deficiency. In the first year, three farms with 50 lambs each participated. Lambs from each farm were allocated to five groups of 10 animals each. The first group received a Co bullet at weaning, and each month another group was treated with a Co bullet. The lambs were weighed monthly, and blood and liver samples were taken prior to treatment and each subsequent month from five lambs of the first supplemented group. The trial lasted about four months.  Serum vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in lambs at weaning were between 500 and 1000 pmol/l. Although supplementation increased serum levels for the first month this was followed by a drop to near or below starting concentrations. An exception was Farm 3 where serum vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations rose again at the end of the trial. Liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations also showed an overall decline from starting levels (200 to 300 nmol/kg fresh tissue) to the end of the trial (100 to 200 nmol/kg fresh tissue). MMA started around 2 &#181;mol/l and reached between 6 and 7 &#181;mol/l in the untreated lambs on Farms 1 and 3 two months after weaning before decreasing to around 3 &#181;mol/l at the end of the trial, whereas the treated lambs maintained MMA concentrations around 2 &#181;mol/l. On Farm 2 MMA started just below 5 &#181;mol/l, decreased to around 1 &#181;mol/l for treated and untreated lambs one month later and rose again to between 2.5 and 4 &#181;mol/l, respectively, at the end of the trial. LWG was below average for all lambs (between 0.20 and 0.04 kg/d except for Farm I in the first month after weaning) but no significant differences were noted between treated and untreated lambs on any of the farms.  Another trial was conducted on one of these farms in the following year. One hundred lambs were divided into two groups of 50 each at weaning and sampled monthly for about six months. One group was treated with two Co bullets, the other group remained untreated. Pasture Co was between 0.04 and 0.07 &#181;g/g DM, yet serum levels for the untreated group stayed ~500 pmol/l throughout the trial. Serum vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations for the treated group started at ~500 pmol/l, rose to ~2500 pmol/l before falling back to ~2000 pmol/l. Liver vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations for the untreated and treated groups were 529 and 427 nmol/kg fresh tissue at weaning, respectively. This decreased for both groups to ~350 nmol/kg fresh tissue one month after weaning. In the untreated lambs liver values decreased further to ~290 nmol/kg fresh tissue whereas they increased to ~450 nmol/kg fresh tissue for the treated group at the end of the trial. MMA concentrations started between 2 and 3 &#181;mol/l for both groups and increased to 4.5 &#181;mol/l for the untreated group one month later before falling back to 3.2 &#181;mol/l. In the treated group MMA decreased to ~1&#181;mol/l and stayed at that level throughout the trial. There was no difference in weight gain.  In order to obtain an understanding of the distribution of corrinoids in biological tissues a High Performance Liquid Chromatography method was developed. The sensitivity of the analytical method meant that it was only practical to assay mainly liver samples because of the higher vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations than in other tissues. The general finding was that the coenzyme 5&#8217; &#8211;deoxyadenosylcobalamin (ado-cbl) constituted the highest proportion of corrinoids in liver (45 %), followed by analogues (28 %), OH-cbl (24 %) and lastly methy1cobalamin (3 %). Ado-cbl did tend to be proportionately higher in supplemented than in unsupplemented animals (56 and 42 %, respectively), whereas biologically non-active analogues tended to be higher in untreated than in treated sheep (29 and 21 %, respectively).  It was concluded that in the farm trials Co deficiency was only mild or not present although deficiency would have been predicted from the low vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; concentrations in serum and liver and from raised MMA values. Therefore, currently used thresholds in New Zealand appear to be too high for vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322;, and overseas values for MMA do not seem to be appropriate. Revised marginal ranges of 100 to 200 pmol/l for serum, 100 to 200 nmol/kg fresh tissue for liver and 10 to 20 &#181;mol/l for MMA are suggested. Further, this work shows that Co bullets were effective in elevating blood and liver vitamin B&#8321;&#8322;concentrations for longer than one year.  In the trials with preruminant lambs it was found that maintenance requirements were met by the vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; content of milk replacer. There is evidence from indoor and farm trials that vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322; from milk was much more readily absorbed than vitamin B&#8321;&#8322; from supplements. It was estimated that suckling lambs probably require between 1200 and 4000 pmol vitamin  B&#8321;&#8322;/d, depending on age.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">lambs</field><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">vitamin B&#8321;&#8322;</field><field name="subject">cobalamins</field><field name="subject">corrinoids</field><field name="subject">coenzymes</field><field name="subject">analogues</field><field name="subject">methylmalonic acid</field><field name="subject">faecal egg count</field><field name="subject">propionate</field><field name="subject">reference ranges</field><field name="subject">requirements</field><field name="subject">HPLC</field><field name="subject">070204 - Animal Nutrition</field><field name="subject">060101 - Analytical Biochemistry</field><field name="subject">060104 - Cell Metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2098</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taranaki waiata tangi and feelings for place</field><field name="creator">Smith, Ailsa Lorraine</field><field name="description">The occupation of Moutoa Gardens in 1995 highlighted efforts by Whanganui iwi to draw attention to the non-settlement of long-standing land grievances arising out of land confiscations by the Crown in New Zealand in the 1860s. Maori attitudes to land have not been well understood by successive New Zealand governments since that time, nor by many Pakeha New Zealanders. In an effort to overcome that lack of understanding, this thesis studies a particular genre of Maori composition; namely, waiata tangi or songs of lament, which contain a strong indigenous sense of place component. The waiata used in this study derive from my tribal area of Taranaki, which is linked historically and through whakapapa with Whanganui iwi. These waiata were recorded in manuscript form in the 1890s by my great-grandfather Te Kahui Kararehe, and are a good source from which to draw conclusions about the traditional nature of Maori feelings for place. Two strands run throughout this thesis. The first examines the nature of Maori feelings for place and land, which have endured through primary socialisation to the present day. By focusing upon a form of expression that reveals the attachment of Maori towards their ancestral homelands, it is hoped that the largely monocultural Pakeha majority in New Zealand will be made aware of that attachment. It is also hoped that Pakeha may be suitably informed of the consequences of colonialist intervention in the affairs of the Maori people since 1840, which have resulted in cultural deprivation and material disadvantage at the present day. In the current climate of government moves to address the problems bequeathed them by their predecessors, it is important that the settlement of land claims and waterways under the Treaty of Waitangi should proceed unhindered by misapprehension and misinformation on the part of the public at large. The second strand of my thesis concerns the waiata texts themselves, which I wish to bring to the attention of the descendants of the composers of those waiata, who may or may not know of their existence. Since so much of value has been lost to the Maori world it is important that the culturally precious items that remain should be restored as soon as possible to those to whom they rightfully belong. Key themes examined in this thesis are the nature of Maori "feelings" for place and a "sense" of place; Maori research methodologies and considerations, including Maori cosmology and genealogical lines of descent; ethical concerns and intellectual property rights; ethnographic writings from the nineteenth century which tried to make sense of Maori imagery and habits of thought; the Kahui Papers from which the waiata were drawn; and the content and imagery of the waiata themselves. I also discuss the use of hermeneutics as a methodological device for unlocking the meanings of words and references in the waiata, and present the results both from a western sense of place perspective and a Maori viewpoint based on cultural concepts and understandings.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confiscation</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">intellectual property rights</field><field name="subject">land</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Moutoa Gardens</field><field name="subject">research ethics</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">waiata tangi</field><field name="subject">Whanganui</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">050208 - M&#257;ori Environmental Knowledge</field><field name="subject">200207 - M&#257;ori Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2137</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mixed grazing of sheep and cattle using continuous or rotational stocking</field><field name="creator">Kitessa, Soressa Mererra</field><field name="description">Two consecutive experiments were conducted to test a hypothesis that mixed grazing outcome is influenced by the type of stocking system applied. The objective of both experiments was to investigate the influence of co-grazing with sheep on cattle liveweight gain (LWG) under continuous (C) and rotational (R) stocking, where sheep weekly liveweight change under the two stocking systems was kept similar. In experiment I nine yearling heifers (266 &#177; 4.5 kg liveweight) and 27 ewe hoggets (54&#177;0.9 kg liveweight) were continuously stocked for 19 weeks on an irrigated perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture (2.95 ha) maintained at a sward surface height (SSH) of 5cm by adding or removing additional animals in a fixed ratio (1: 1 W&#8304;.&#8311;&#8309; cattle:sheep). An equal area of pasture was rotationally stocked by a similar group of animals where they received a new area of pasture daily and also had access to the grazed area over the previous 2 days. The size of the new area provided daily was such that the weekly liveweight change of rotationally co-grazed sheep was equal to that of those continuously co-grazed with cattle. Similar groups of animals were used in the second experiment with additional group of 9 heifers grazed alone on C and R pastures.  Liveweight of animals was recorded weekly and final fasted weight was determined after 24-hour total feed restriction. SSH on both treatment swards was recorded daily. There were three intake measurement periods spread over the trial period. Organic matter intake (OMI) was predicted from the ratio of N-alkanes in faeces and herbage. Diet composition was determined by dissecting oesophageal extrusa samples. Grazing behaviour (bite rates and grazing time) were also recorded.  The mean SSH for C pasture was 5.1&#177;0.09 cm. Overall pre- and post-grazing SSH for R pasture was 15.9 &#177;0.12 and 5.6 &#177;0.07 cm, respectively. As determined by the protocol average daily LWG of sheep was similar between C and R (147 (&#177;5.8) vs 138 (&#177;6.7) g day&#8315;&#185;; (P&gt;0.05). In contrast, cattle continuously stocked with sheep grew 200 g day&#8315;&#185; slower than those rotationally stocked with sheep (800 (&#177;41.6) vs 1040 (&#177;47.7) g day&#8315;&#185;, P&lt;0.0l). R heifers achieved 30 kg higher final fasted liveweight than C heifers (350 vs 381 kg; P&lt;0.01). Overall LWG per ha was also 6 % higher under R than C stocking (674 vs 634 kg ha&#8315;&#185;). The OMD of both sheep (73.5 vs 75.8 %) and cattle (75.8 vs 78.0 %) diets was similar under continuous and rotational stocking. There was no significant difference OMI data also concurred with the L WG data (Cattle: 7.94 vs 6.31 (&#177;0.32) kg day&#8315;&#185; (P&lt;0.05); sheep: 1.40 vs 1.44 (&#177;0.04) kg day&#8315;&#185; for Rand C treatments, respectively). There was no difference in clover content of cattle diet under C and R treatments. C heifers had higher number of bites per minute than R heifers (62 vs 56; P&lt;0.05). Proportion of heifers seen grazing (every 15-minute) during four 24-hour observations was greater on C than R pasture (0.44 vs 0.31 (&#177;0.03); P&lt;0.05). The similarity coefficient between sheep and cattle diet was 0.61 and 0.76 under C and R stocking, respectively.  The lower daily LWG of C heifers was attributed to (a) the lower SSH under C than R stocking and/or (b) the inability of cattle to compete well with sheep where there is small, continual renewal of resources (C) in contrast to a large periodic renewal under R stocking. This experiment showed that the outcome of mixed gruing can be influenced by the stocking system chosen. But it was not possible to apportion the difference in LWG of cattle between mixed grazing per se and the difference in mean grazed sward height (5.1 for C vs 10.8 cm for R).  A second experiment was conducted to determine the relative performance of cattle co-grazed with sheep (CS) and grazed alone (CA) under each stocking system. Hence, there were four treatments. CA- continuous stocking (CA-C), CS- continuous stocking (CS-C), CA- rotational stocking (CAR) and CS- rotational stocking (CS-R). A total area of 4.42 ha was allocated to each stocking system. Under C stocking, 2.95 ha (2/3) was assigned to CS-C and 1.47 ha (1/3) to CA-C, and SSH on both treatments was kept at 4 cm by adding or removing extra animals. Under R stocking, CA-R and CS-R grazed side by side separated by an electric fence. They were given a fresh area daily, the size of which was varied such that the weekly LW change of R sheep was equal to that of the C sheep. CA-R received one-third of the new area though the size was adjusted regularly to achieve the same post-grazing SSH with CS-R. Measurements included: weekly liveweight change, OMI (two periods) and diet composition (using N-alkanes). The mean SSH of CA-C and CS-C swards was 4.27 and 4.26 (&#177;0.02) cm, respectively. CA-R and CS-R swards had mean pre-grazing SSH of 14.9 and 15.2 (&#177;0.08) cm and post-grazing heights of 4.87 and 4.82 cm (&#177;0.03), respectively. The proportion of areas infrequently grazed was higher for CA-C than CS-C swards (0.22 vs 0.17, respectively).  C and R sheep daily LWG: 155 (&#177;0.6) and 147 (&#177;0.7) g, and OMI: 1.96 and 2.04 (&#177;0.ll) kg, respectively, were not significantly different. They also had similar diet composition. In comparison, CS-C heifers grew only at 69 % of the daily LWG achieved by CS-R heifers (706 vs 1028 (&#177;72) g; P&lt;0.05). LWG of CA-C and CA-R was 916 and 1022 (&#177;72) g day&#8315;&#185;, respectively. The difference in LWG between CS-R and CS-C (D&#8321;) heifers was due to difference in mean sward height, stocking system and mixed grazing, while D&#8322; (difference in LWG between CA-R and CAC) was due to difference in mean sward height and stocking system. D&#8321;-D&#8322; (the effect of stocking system on mixed grazing) was 216 g and made up 67 % of the total difference between CS-R and CS-C. There was a significant stocking system-species mixture interaction in the final fasted LW achieved by heifers. Final fasted LW was significantly lower for CS-C than CA-C heifers (283 vs 323 (&#177;9.7) kg), but did not differ between CS-R and CA-R (332 vs 330 (&#177;9.7) kg, respectively). The digestibility of diet OM was similar for both continuously and rotationally stocked sheep (84.4 vs 83.2 %, respectively). Cattle diet OMO was 76.5, 74.7, 79.4 and 77.8 for CA-C, CS-C, CA-R and CS-R respectively (P&gt;0.05). Differences in OMI followed a similar pattern to daily LWG. Mean daily OMI was 8.98, 6.24, 8.80 and 9.45 (&#177;0.40) kg for CA-C, CS-C, CA-R and CS-R, respectively. Clover content of the diet of CA-C heifers was three times higher than that of CS-C heifers (30.7 vs 10.4 % OM; P&lt;0.05); there was no difference in clover content of diets of CS-R and CA-R heifers (21.5 vs 23.9 % OM, respectively). In both stocking systems LWG per ha was higher on CA than CS treatments.  These results suggested that the disadvantage of selective clover grazing by sheep outweighed the advantages of sheep grazing around cattle dung patches under continuous stocking. Under rotational stocking, rapid diurnal changes in sward conditions probably limited selective grazing by both sheep and cattle such that there was no disadvantage to CS cattle. The results do not provide a basis for recommending grazing cattle with sheep rather than cattle alone, but do provide some basis for recommending co-grazing of sheep and cattle using rotational rather than continuous stocking.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">continuous stocking</field><field name="subject">diet composition</field><field name="subject">frequently grazed areas</field><field name="subject">grazing behaviour</field><field name="subject">infrequently grazed areas</field><field name="subject">intake</field><field name="subject">liveweight gain</field><field name="subject">mixed grazing</field><field name="subject">N-alkanes</field><field name="subject">perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">rotational stocking</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">stocking system</field><field name="subject">sward surface height</field><field name="subject">white clover</field><field name="subject">070203 - Animal Management</field><field name="subject">070202 - Animal Growth and Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2245</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling differences in angler choice behaviour with advanced discrete choice models</field><field name="creator">Beville, S. T.</field><field name="description">New Zealand is internationally renowned for having some of the finest and most challenging trout fishing in the world.  However, due to continuing development and angling pressure many fishing sites are showing signs of environmental degradation and over fishing.  This trend is almost certain to continue into the future given continued population and economic growth.  Understanding the determinants of site choice, preference heterogeneity and anglers&#8217; substitution patterns is fundamentally important to fishery managers who have the difficult task of maintaining quality angling experiences on a number of fishing sites, managing angling pressure and maintaining license sales.  Recent advances in simulation techniques and computational power have improved the capability of discrete choice models to reveal preference heterogeneity and complex substitution patterns among individuals.  This thesis applies and evaluates a number of state-of-the-art discrete choice models to study angler site choice in New Zealand.  Recreation specialisation theory is integrated into the analysis to enhance the behavioural representation of the statistical models.  A suite of models is presented throughout the empirical portion of this thesis.  These models demonstrate different ways and degrees of explaining preference heterogeneity as well as identifying anglers&#8217; substitution patterns.  The results show that North Canterbury anglers&#8217; preferences vary considerably.  Resource disturbances such as riparian margin erosion, reduced water visibility and declines in catch rates can cause significant declines in angler use of affected sites, and at the same time non-proportional increases in the use of unaffected sites.  Recreation specialisation is found to be closely related to the types of fishing site conditions, experiences and regulations preferred by anglers.  Anglers&#8217; preference intensities for fishing site attributes, such as catch rates, vary across different types of fishing sites.  This location specific preference heterogeneity is found to be related to specialisation.  Overall, the empirical findings indicate that conventional approaches to modelling angler site choice which do not incorporate a strong understanding of angler preference heterogeneity can lead to poorly representative models and suboptimal management and policy outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">random utility model</field><field name="subject">mixed logit</field><field name="subject">latent class</field><field name="subject">choice model</field><field name="subject">recreational angling</field><field name="subject">preference heterogeneity</field><field name="subject">multinomial logit</field><field name="subject">05 - Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">160402 - Recreation, Leisure and Tourism Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2332</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of image analysis for studing mite behaviour</field><field name="creator">Bowie, Mike H.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of image analysis for studying mite behaviour. Image analysis was used to convert video recordings of mites' locomotory behaviour into a series of x,y coordinates that, when joined, closely resemble the paths of mites. The coordinates were also used to calculate walking speed, direction of travel, turning frequency, turn bias and tortuosity. Two experimental arenas were developed and used to study the movement of three mite species: 1) a leaf disc arena for two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch and European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch); and 2), a cover-slip/tack-trap arena for Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten. Two-spotted spider mite exhibited a change in locomotory behaviour through a 48 minute period. Mites exhibited a significant decline in distance travelled, whereas the mean stationary time (per four minute interval) more than doubled, and the duration of stationary events increased steadily over the same period. A reduction in sampling frequency of mite coordinates from one per second to one every two seconds and every four seconds produced a 5% and 12% 'loss' in path length respectively. Sample period length was shown to greatly influence the results produced for some of the mean parameters calculated, however, a reduction in sample length from 3000 to 1500 coordinates was not considered to cause a major loss in information. The influence of the inherent mite movement could not be ignored and made it difficult to make decisions on the 'best' sample length to use. Some strong correlations were found between parameters used to analyse mite locomotory behaviour. In particular, arithmetic mean vector length, speed, total stationary time and total distance travelled were significantly correlated with each other. Mean angular deviation and weighted mean vector length, which both measure the degree of clustering around the mean heading angle, were strongly negatively correlated. Parameters which differentiated between 'straight' and 'tortuous' mite movement were found to be mean meander, absolute mean turn and fractal dimensions. Mean meander was thought to be the most 'powerful', while coefficient of a straight line, a commonly used parameter for measuring tortuosity, did not significantly differentiate between the two different behaviours. Frequency distributions of turns and standard deviations of the three mite species were very similar. All three species had a slight bias to turning right (clockwise) rather than  to the left (counter-clockwise) and for each species certain angles occurred more often than would be expected in a 'perfect' normal distribution. A similar pattern also occurred with the frequency distribution of two-spotted spider mite heading angles, in that angles which were expected to occur more often, did not, and vice versa. The potential to use saturated salt solutions to control relative humidity on the arena was` demonstrated and indicated that relative humidity is likely to have an important influence on mite behaviour. Two-spotted spider mites appeared to move more quickly in an attempt to escape the unfavourable, extreme (10% and 95% R.H. at 25&#176;C) moisture conditions. All three mite species displayed a characteristic edge-walking behaviour around the arenas. However, when 'edge' and 'non-edge' behaviours were compared, mean meander was the only parameter (of the parameters tested) which gave a significant difference. Behavioural responses of European red mite and T. pyri to sub-lethal (field rate) esfenvalerate were investigated and the results indicated that these mites did not seek the unsprayed halves of the arenas during the first 48 minutes. However, significant differences in most behavioural parameters to esfenvalerate residues were found with European red mite when whole arenas were compared. Image analysis is an extremely useful research tool for studying mite behaviour because of its ability to measure many parameters quickly. Careful choice of the environmental conditions, the sampling framework, and interpretation of data is essential for meaningful results.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">locomotory behaviour</field><field name="subject">two-spotted spider mite</field><field name="subject">Tetranychus urticae</field><field name="subject">European red mite</field><field name="subject">Panonychus ulmi</field><field name="subject">Typhlodromus pyri</field><field name="subject">esfenvalerate</field><field name="subject">sub-lethal effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280203 Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1056</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of a marine protected area by a local NGO in Honduras: its implications for local communities</field><field name="creator">Jimenez-Castro, Claudia</field><field name="description">This study explores the factors that influence the management of a protected area situated on private land as well as the implications of these factors in the interaction between the NGO and the communities associated with this area. The protected area, Marine National Monument Cayos Cochinos, is an archipelago surrounded by reefs in the Honduran Caribbean. This area is home to a highly heterogeneous population of fisherfolk communities &#8211;most are members of the Garifuna ethnic group&#8211; and wealthy Honduran and foreign landowners. This case study also comprises three fisherfolk communities outside the protected area who fish in Cayos Cochinos. Local fishermen in Cayos Cochinos are settled in community-owned areas; however, these settlements started by the occupation of private lands. Wealthy landowners have either individual land titles or shares of a firm owning four of the islands. The protected area was established through the initiative of this firm to protect the natural resources. This area is nominally co-managed by a local nongovernmental organisation (NGO) and two government agencies; however in practice it is managed solely by the NGO. This study discusses the influence of the nature of the Honduran legislation regarding protected areas and of the co-management agreement on the management of Cayos Cochinos. This research also shows that the management priorities of this protected area are only partially based on the Honduran government&#8217;s laws and regulations and the guidelines specific for this area. Lack of government participation in the co-management of the area, financial constraints, influences on the NGO of stakeholders in higher positions of power with respect to it, personal preferences of the NGO managers and issues regarding the communities&#8217; leadership, have all had an influence on the management priorities of the protected area since its constitution. The combined effect of these factors has influenced the management of the NGO towards prioritising the natural resource conservation. This area is managed under a &#8216;people-out&#8217; conservation paradigm. The adoption of this paradigm has disadvantaged the fisherfolk communities inside and outside the protected area by restricting their access to the natural resources on which their livelihoods are highly dependent. However, the same situation has favoured the private landowners by limiting the access of the fisherfolk communities to the land owned by the former. The privileging of one community sector over another has created conflicts between the NGO and the fisherfolk communities. However, these conflicts have been fuelled by other factors such as the steady contesting of the land titles over the territories occupied by the latter, and by the support that external organisations have given to the latter at the expense of the original owners of the land. This research suggests that local NGOs in charge of the management of natural protected areas might have limited capacity to abide by national conservation and sustainable development priorities due to the likelihood to be influenced by external forces with different priorities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-governmental organisation (NGO)</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">protected area</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">marine protected area</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1237</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belt conveyer transfers : quantifying and modelling mechanisms of particle flow</field><field name="creator">Hastie, David Bryan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to determine if either analytical methods or numerical discrete element modelling could be used with accuracy to design conveyor transfers. This goal was achieved using two test materials, polyethylene pellets and corn, which were selected for their different particle and bulk properties and also for a third product, iron ore, but to a lesser extent due to test rig limitations. The design of conveyor transfers has traditionally been based on either trial and error or previous experience and seen as a &#8220;black art&#8221; rather than a science, as such very few design guides are available. The design of conveyor transfers can be based on experimental investigations, although this method can be costly to companies, taking vital resources away from the key goal of continuous production. The analytical models have existed for some time and have become widely accepted design tools; however, there is limited validation of these to determine their overall performance (both advantages and disadvantages). The analytical models are two dimensional in application and their accuracy with respect to the three dimensional nature of transfer chutes is not clear. This is an area which needs further investigation. The design of transfer chutes has undergone an evolution since the advent of discrete element modelling (DEM) as well as increases in computer processing power. The potential to simulate and predict the behaviour of a transfer chute design before it is constructed can be highly desirable with the prospect of saving substantial time and money. This being said, there has been little validation published on the application of DEM in industrial applications, although in recent years this has started to increase with the realisation that companies need to be convinced this is a legitimate design tool. Additional DEM validation is warranted with respect to conveyor transfers. An experimental test program was undertaken following the design and commissioning of a novel conveyor transfer research facility. This experimental work focussed on two main areas; investigation of particle flow of material through a conveyor transfer hood and spoon and the generation of conveyor trajectories. From these areas, &#8216;real&#8217; data was obtained for a range of granular free-flowing products, using a combination of high-speed video capture and still photography, for the purposes of validation. The effect of belt speed, material feed rate and the positioning of the transfer hood and spoon were considered in these investigations. Additional to this experimental work was the testing and collection of a wide range of particle and system characteristics for use in the analytical modelling and discrete element modelling components of this research. Two analytical models were then used to predict the particle flow of the test materials through the conveyor transfer hood and spoon. Belt speed, material feed rate and positioning of the transfer hood and spoon were all considered as part of this analysis to provide direct comparisons with the data obtained from the experimental testing.  Prediction of the conveyor trajectories was performed using seven trajectory models available in the literature. These comparisons investigated the effect of belt speed and mass flow rate on the trajectory profiles, again providing a direct link with the experimental data. The discrete element method was used to generate three dimensional simulations of the material flow through the conveyor transfer hood and spoon and also conveyor trajectories, based on 3D CAD models of the conveyor transfer research facility. These simulation outputs were then compared to both the experimental data and data obtained from the analytical models. Two software packages were used, Chute MavenTM and EDEM. Chute MavenTM was used to produce the initial transfer chute and trajectory simulations using spherical particles. High material feed rates corresponding to those tested experimentally could not be simulated and so EDEM was employed to develop further simulations. The fact that EDEM has the ability to model both spherical and shaped (clustered) particles was utilised to investigate the effect of shape on simulation output. A critical aspect of any discrete element modelling is whether the outputs are realistic. To minimise any potential issues, a wide range of bench-scale calibration experiments and simulations were also completed to validate both DEM packages used. It can be concluded that the analytical models for conveyor transfers provided close approximations from a two dimensional perspective, however, there were some slight over-predictions evident in some situations. For conveyor trajectories, the models presented a substantial variation in prediction, however, one method stood out as being accurate under all conditions for the materials tested experimentally. Findings from the discrete element modelling showed the dynamic behaviour mimics that of the experimental testing and there was a general agreement with both the experimental investigations and analytical models for the conveyor transfer comparisons. With respect to conveyor trajectories, the DEM results agreed with the results seen experimentally and also predicted the same trajectory path as the one &#8220;stand out&#8221; analytical trajectory method mentioned above. The importance of DEM calibration and validation has also been documented and shown to be an absolute necessity in the successful simulation of industrial applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3094</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D geometric and haptic modeling of hand-woven textile artifacts</field><field name="creator">Shidanshidi, Hooman</field><field name="description">Haptic Modeling of textile has attracted significant interest over the last decade. In spite of extensive research, no generic system has yet been proposed. The majority of the haptic models developed in the previous work assume a 2D mesh model for the textile which does not represent the real geometric configuration of the textile. In addition, they are based on empirical parameters obtained from textile samples using specialized instruments. The process is often time consuming and elaborate, consisting of manual measurement of physical and mechanical properties of the artifacts. The development of a generic approach for 3D haptic modeling of hand-woven textile artifacts is pursued in this work. In the proposed approach, the textile pattern and structure are recognized by digital processing of the artifact still image. A fuzzy-rule based expert system is developed to perform the recognition process. The data obtained in this process is employed to automatically generate the 3D geometric model of the artifact in VRML. The mechanical properties of the artifact are estimated by processing the textile geometric characteristics and yarn properties in a neural network system. These mechanical properties are then deployed in the construction of the textile mechanical model. The mechanical model is superimposed over the 3D geometric model to construct the haptic model. The proposed system is validated through both subjective and objective methods using a number of artifact samples.  An extensive review of the published literature on the haptic modeling of textile is provided in the thesis. The benefits of textile haptic modeling are identified. Applications of existing models are reviewed and the significance and unique contribution of the work is presented.The image processing method and the fuzzy rule based expert system deployed in the construction of the geometric model are described in detail. The outcome is a 3D geometric model of the artifact in VRML which could be explored in a virtual reality world viewer. Similarly, the neural network model designed to estimate the mechanical characteristics of an artifact is presented the results of the training and validation of the model are provided.Finally, two methods developed for the haptic model based on geometric and mechanical models in the Reachin are explained. The accuracy and effectiveness of the overall approach are validated through a series of experiments. Overall, the work conduced in this study offers a novel 3D generic haptic modeling for textile artifacts. It can be deployed in museums providing an opportunity for the visitors to touch unique samples of hand-woven textile artifacts. The approach is cost-effective, reliable and reproducible as the haptic modeling of these samples doesn&#8217;t need time-consuming and costly laboratory conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3095</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the risk of corporate failure for Australian listed companies : a fresh approach using probability-based tri-dimensional modelling</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Bill</field><field name="description">Corporate failure is a regularly recurring problem for stakeholders, particularly investors, creditors and customers.  Early attempts at predicting such failure typically relied on analysis of individual performance measurements such as accounting ratios; it was not until the late 1960s that a modelling approach to the problem started to evolve. Altman&#8217;s Z-score model was the first approach to combine a series of weighted ratios using the statistical technique of multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) to arrive at a final score, which was used to determine whether or not a company was likely to fail.  Substantial research has followed over the subsequent 40 years, resulting in model variants ranging from slight changes to the seminal Z-score approach, and finally to totally different approaches using a range of statistical tools.This thesis builds on this earlier research by, firstly, reviewing the extensive literature to assess the perceived strengths and deficiencies of previous modelling approaches.  Then, having set the key objective of arriving at a robust model that recognises these strengths and deficiencies and is readily accessible to researchers and practitioners, the model construct uses a combination of key components research has indicated to be of high predictive value.  These comprise a combination of Z-score component factors, indicators of excessive gearing and overtrading, and key cash-flow indicators.  The importance of non-financial factors has been emphasised by some researchers and, whilst they were considered and included in the model development, their value was found to be restricted to the most recent accounting period prior to the failure event; other problems also limited their overall effectiveness.  A raw cash flow from operations (CFFO) figure was not discussed at length in the literature and has been largely ignored in previous models, usually in favour of cash-flow ratios. However, its inclusion was found to enhance the robustness of the model developed in this thesis.One of the key problems highlighted in previous research was the practicality of embracing a fail/non-fail cut-off point as presented by the MDA approach so commonly applied in many models.  With the limitations and risks of such an approach it was decided instead to pursue a probability-of-failure scenario using the statistical tool, logistic regression.  Two databases of Australian listed companies were developed, one of 47 failed companies and the other of 35 non-failed, both from three closely related industry groupings.  The data from these companies, when applied to the model, produced results that predominantly met expectations with higher static and trending probability of failure as the actual failure event approached, and declining static and trending probability of failure for those companies in the non-fail category.Substantial scope exists for further application of the modelling approach used in this thesis once adjustments are made for different industry categories and/or geographic environments.  This could involve application of the model across a broad range of industry applications as well as ongoing refinement of the model in line with testing the effectiveness of an expanded range of potential indicator inputs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3092</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making links between theory and practice : an investigation into pre-service teacher learning experiences with an online simulation</field><field name="creator">Carrington, Lisa A.</field><field name="description">Current research in teacher education identifies a gap between what teachers are taught during their pre-service teacher education and what they are expected to do at the &#8216;chalk-face&#8217; in their professional career (Cole &amp; Knowles, 2000; Ramsey, 2000; Sorin, 2004). In response to the perception that theory is often irrelevant to practice, various studies assert that there is a need to integrate the various components of pre-service teacher education (for relevant studies see Brady, Seagal, Bamford &amp; Deer, 1998; Lanier &amp; Little, 1986). An integrated approach is advocated to enable pre-service teachers to gain a better understanding of the theory/practice nexus (Educational Training Committee, 2005; MACQT, 1998). In response to such studies, teacher educators are motivated to investigate strategies that might more effectively and relevantly bridge the gap between theory and practice.One approach has been to use simulations as a tool to experiment with practical scenarios while providing explicit links to the theory of pre-service teacher training. Simulations have the potential to enhance a learning experience by providing authentic and relevant scenarios in which learners apply their newly-acquired knowledge by experimenting and making decisions within a safe, virtual environment in which mistakes have no consequences, such as they have in the real world (Carrington, Ferry &amp; Kervin, 2006; Aldrich, 2004; Jonassen, 2000). Limited research has been conducted on the use of simulations in pre-service teacher education and how engagement with simulations can support the learning of pre-service teachers.The purpose of this inquiry was to investigate how pre-service teachers make use of a virtual learning environment provided by an online simulation - ClassSim - to link knowledge from university coursework with field experiences, in particular, whether and how experience with an online simulation contributed to the development of preservice teachers&#8217; emerging professional identity. A comparative case analysis was adopted, as this design was considered most appropriate as it allowed for an in-depth comparison of two cohorts of pre-service teachers. Andragogy (Knowles, 1970, 1980, 1984; Knowles, Holton &amp; Swanson, 1998) provide a theoretical framework through which the learning of pre-service teachers was examined and assumptions about their learning drawn.The findings indicate that virtual learning environments, such as ClassSim, provide significant potential for teacher education as theory is integrated with virtual practice. It was found that in order to facilitate an adults&#8217; learning within a virtual learning environment, educators must embrace the opportunities afforded by the technology. Virtual learning environments provide flexibility as learners engage with the learning environment anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace. To respond to the needs of adult learners, a virtual learning environment should have an interactive design, be learnercentred and able to facilitate and motivate self-direction in learners. Furthermore, the inclusion of practical real-life scenarios in conjunction with relevant learning/teaching theories is essential if a user is to develop an understanding of the theory-to-practice connection as they develop their professional identity.Overall, this inquiry has highlighted a number of important learning design principles an adult educator should take into consideration when designing and implementing virtual learning experiences for adult learners. It highlights the importance of a strong theory-to-practice connection in the development of a professional identity, which is explored in this inquiry via reflection.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3093</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of Sensory Feedback When Adapting to Novel Visuomotor Environments</field><field name="creator">Hinder, Mark</field><field name="description">The aim of the research described in this thesis is to improve our understanding of how the central nervous system (CNS) integrates feedback information from different sensory modalities to permit skill acquisition, and the subsequent consolidation of that skill, when exposed to a novel visuomotor environment. Indeed, such adaptation must be consolidated and recalled when appropriate such that we do not have to continually relearn skills we once possessed. By manipulating the sensory feedback available from the visual and proprioceptive systems during learning, it is possible to determine those facets of the sensory feedback that are essential for adaptation to occur. The thesis consists of seven chapters. The first and last provide a conceptual basis for, and an overall discussion of, the research. Chapter 2 reviews current visuomotor adaptation research, with particular focus on the manner in which information about novel tasks is stored within the CNS as we adapt, and the sensory information that is necessary to allow this adaptation to occur. Furthermore, this chapter serves to introduce many of the experimental techniques that are used to investigate motor learning in humans. Chapter 3 is a report of an investigation of the issues of interference and consolidation in an isometric target acquisition task. Exposure to a 30&#176; counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation was followed by a period of rest, trials with no rotation, or trials with a 60&#176; clockwise (CW) rotation. Retention of the initial adaptation was assessed 5 hours later. Full interference was manifested in circumstances in which either counter-rotated or non-rotated trials were encountered following the initial learning period. These results are consistent with the view that the observed interference is anterograde in nature, and highlight differences in the mechanisms employed by the CNS when compensating for novel kinematics (e.g. visuomotor rotations) compared with adapting to novel dynamics (e.g. external forces). Chapter 4 is a report of an investigation of the role of visual feedback in adapting to novel visuomotor environments in an isometric target acquisition task. Following trials with no rotation, participants adapted to a 60&#176; CCW visuomotor rotation before returning to the non-rotated condition. Separate groups received either continuous visual feedback (CF) of cursor position during task execution or post-trial visual feedback (PF), both indicating task performance. One CF group were instructed to make any (feedback) modifications necessary during the task to reduce errors and acquire the target, while another CF group were instructed to make uncorrected, ballistic movements. Colour cues permitted the identification of the task environment (nonrotated/ rotated) on every trial. The results indicate that an automatic recalibration of the visuomotor mapping occurs when CF is provided, and suggest that performance improvements with PF may occur via the adoption of a cognitively mediated strategy. Furthermore, execution of feedback motor commands to correct errors did not enhance the adaptation that occurred when CF was provided, indicating that the perception of sensory errors (and not feedback commands that may be applied to reduce those errors) drives feedforward visuomotor adaptation. To investigate whether additional proprioceptive feedback associated with movement altered the adaptation patterns observed in chapter 4, a study similar to that reported in chapter 4 was undertaken, and is reported in chapter 5. In this instance a discrete, goaldirected, movement task replaced the isometric task. Subjects were deprived of vision of their arm, but were provided with PF or CF indicating task performance. The patterns of adaptation noted in the isometric task were also exhibited in this dynamic task, indicating that the timing of the visual feedback of task performance has a profound effect on how performance improvements in a novel visuomotor rotation occur. The experiment reported in Chapter 6 assessed the ability to adapt to two conflicting visuomotor rotations interleaved within the same training period, when each task variant (rotation) could be identified by contextual (colour) cues. While full dual adaptation was not observed, the results suggest that the colour cues may have been utilised to explicitly select distinct motor commands for each task rotation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321400 Human Movement and Sports Science</field><field name="subject">320702 Central Nervous System</field><field name="subject">skill acquisition</field><field name="subject">CNS</field><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="subject">visuomotor environment</field><field name="subject">sensory feedback</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">relearning</field><field name="subject">proprioception</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131122</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation framework for collaborative management of protected areas: a cross-cultural case study in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Izurieta, Arturo</field><field name="description">Management of protected areas and natural resources is shifting from sole control by government agencies to a more collaborative and shared approach to governance between agencies and civil society. This collaboration, known as co-management (collaborative management or sometimes co-operative management) brings together elements of sharing power, decision-making and actions, with trust and capacity building. The engagement of Indigenous people in co-management of protected areas and natural resources in Australia is still maturing. Sharing authority and responsibility with Indigenous people in marine and coastal protected areas is more complicated than on land, since the legal impetus for co-operation is less clear and the &#8216;country&#8217; of Indigenous people does not recognise governance differences between land and sea. Responsibility and legislation concerning both land and sea differs greatly across Australian administrative systems. Indigenous people continue their search for mechanisms that allow them to exercise more control over the land and sea &#8216;country&#8217; that was once theirs. The Cardwell Indigenous Ranger Unit (CIRU) is an initiative to share the management of two world heritage areas, the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of Queensland, between the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation (GAC) an organisation of Traditional Owners, and Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS). This co-management initiative opens an opportunity for Traditional Owners to share with QPWS the responsibilities for and decisions on the management of their land and sea country, through shared management of the ranger unit. It also opens opportunities for QPWS to work closely with Indigenous people, to know more about their culture and to have their support in the day-to-day management of these two iconic protected areas. Their shared objective is protection and sustainable use of the natural resources within these two protected areas. The PhD research focused on the development of a participatory monitoring and evaluation framework to help the parties assess progress in, and thus continuously improve, their collaborative effort. It examined whether a participatory monitoring and evaluation process could enhance the effectiveness of the CIRU co-management initiative and promoted an adaptive management approach to governance and operation of the Indigenous Ranger Unit. Additionally, the research assessed whether the participatory process of building the framework contributed to strengthening the cross-cultural partnership between GAC and QPWS. A Participatory Action Research approach provided the way to identify the current cross-cultural co-management situation, common visions and objectives and to develop criteria and indicators to monitor and evaluate their co-management initiative. Two cycles of assessment enabled the parties to test the indicators they had developed, and to experience the benefits of dialogue and of acting on their assessment findings. The building of the framework contributed to information-sharing and communication, assisting GAC and QPWS in their day-to-day decision-making process and operations in regards to the CIRU. The information-sharing and communication processes also helped build understanding of the issues affecting their co-management arrangement and thus strengthened their partnership. The evaluation framework helped implement an adaptive management approach by providing the parties with information that allowed them to take decisions and adapt them to the circumstances. Decisions were monitored and amended, engaging GAC and QPWS in a learning experience to improve their governance and operations as they continued working together. The research is significant in that evaluation of protected areas has strong international momentum through sponsorship and co-ordination by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and co-management has a thirty year history in parts of the world, yet it is rare for co-management to have consistent evaluation. The participatory approach to evaluation, by and for the co-managing parties, enables them to take ownership of the improvement process for their own benefit and that of the areas and species they manage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131157</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Developmental Analysis of Apostasy from Religious Fundamentalism</field><field name="creator">Raoul Adam</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a broad exploratory analysis of apostasy from religious fundamentalism in light of cognitive developmental theory. Reciprocally, the thesis provides a critique of cognitive developmental theory in light of its application to apostasy from fundamentalism. Autobiographical narratives of approximately 200 apostates from Christian and Muslim fundamentalisms are used to represent the experience of apostasy. Three related and representative cognitive developmental theories are used to inform the analysis of these apostate narratives. These theories include James Fowler&#8217;s Stages of Faith (FDT) (1981); Fritz Oser and Paul Gm&#252;nder&#8217;s Stages of Religious Judgment (RJT) (1991); and Helmut Reich&#8217;s Levels of Relational and Contextual Reasoning (RCR) (2002). These three representative theories are used to generate cognitive developmental hypotheses for the experiences of apostates from fundamentalisms. There are three primary hypotheses guiding the research: (i) Fundamentalist contents predispose a particular form of cognitive operations. (ii) Fundamentalist contents suspend equilibration between accommodation and assimilation. And (iii), some forms of apostasy from fundamentalism are the product of a sociocognitive conflict. These hypotheses are addressed through four research questions: (i) How do fundamentalist cultures sponsor or arrest cognitive development? (ii) What are the developmental characteristics of apostates&#8217; experiences? (iii) What are the implications of cognitive development for apostasy and fundamentalism? And (iv), what are the implications of apostasy from fundamentalism for theories of cognitive development? The thesis utilises a paradigm of critical realism and a theory of interactionism. Critical realism assumes the existence of an objective reality, while acknowledging its exclusively subjective mediation. The interactionist approach acknowledges the potential influences of genetic predisposition, social-environmental context, and individual agency affecting cognitive development and apostasy from fundamentalism. A dual methodological approach is used to collect and analyse data relevant to the hypothesis. Data collection involves two phases: (i) Collection of existing unstructured apostate narratives. And (ii), collection of semi-structured apostate responses. The first phase narratives are collected using online databases, published anthologies, and solicited scripts. The second phase responses are collected using a semi-structured survey. The dual methodological analysis combines coded content analysis and narrative analysis. Coding is informed by the three developmental theories. The qualitative thesis findings may be summarised in two parts. The first pertains to apostasy from fundamentalism; the second pertains to cognitive developmental theory. Of the former, the research found: (i) Cognitive development represents a significant and even primary influence in some forms of apostasy from fundamentalism. And (ii), some forms of fundamentalism sponsor stage specific structures. Reflecting on cognitive theories of religious development, the research found: (i) Sociocultural, affective, and noncognitive physical influences may directly and indirectly facilitate or inhibit cognitive development. (ii) Specific stages and structures of cognitive development may be culturally embedded. (iii) Cognitive development may be compartmentalised. (iv) Cognitive development may regress or fracture when faced with transitional crises and environmental changes. (v) There are diverse trajectories of religious development. And (vi), fractured development at one stage may perpetuate fractured development in the next stage. Finally, the thesis discusses implications of these findings for contemporary dialogue on religious development. These collective findings provide support for a religious styles model (i.e. Streib&#8217;s Religious Styles Perspective, 2001) that integrates a cognitive stream based on Fowler&#8217;s faith development into a more multiperspective understanding of religious development. Such a model would account more adequately for the diverse influences interacting to produce different trajectories of religious development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="subject">Apostasy</field><field name="subject">Fundamentalism</field><field name="subject">Cognitive Development</field><field name="subject">Religious Development</field><field name="subject">Faith</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131309</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context Information Privacy and Context-Enhanced Distributed Authentication for Pervasive Computing Environments</field><field name="creator">Ryan George Wishart</field><field name="description">Rapid advances in computing technology have made it possible to create a pervasive computing environment where computing resources and facilities are available wherever a user may be. This pervasive computing environment goes beyond the concept of city-wide, or nation-wide, wireless network coverage and aims to make interaction between the user and the computing facilities as easy and natural as possible. This requires intelligence on the part of the underlying networks and software supporting the pervasive computing environment, and also awareness of the environment and the context in which the user is operating. Intelligence and awareness on the part of the pervasive computing environment are provided by analysing what is referred to as &#8220;context information&#8221;. This context information can be obtained from hardware or software sensors in the environment, be based on profiled information or derived from context information already known to the pervasive computing environment. The potential to misuse the pervasive computing infrastructure to violate the privacy of users is significant. These violations can range from trading context information about users without consent to abusing a user&#8217;s location information to stalk them. To make the link between users and context information gathered by sensors we developed a concept of contextdependent, multi-party context information ownership. In our approach, ownership of context information entitles the owner(s) to determine how, to whom and under what conditions context information is disclosed to third-party entities. This concept of ownership was then developed into modelling techniques and a representation compatible with a wide range of Object Oriented context modelling approaches. Context information privacy for the users of the pervasive computing environment was then addressed by building on our concept of context-dependent, multi-party context information ownership. Owners of context information, identified using our ownership modelling approach, were able to specify their disclosure preferences for context information modelled as belonging to them. These preferences were captured using a context-dependent privacy preference language. As part of the contribution to the field of context information privacy a context information obfuscation mechanism was also developed. Control of this obfuscation mechanism was integrated with the preference language permitting users to specify not only when, how, why and for what purpose their context information can be disclosed by the pervasive computing environment, but also at what level of detail disclosure may take place. If necessary, the obfuscation mechanism operates on requested context information to reduce its detail level to meet these disclosure requirements. After developing a context information privacy mechanism, we then focused on enhancing the operation of security mechanisms within pervasive computing environments by using context information. From a security perspective, the pervasive computing environment represents a significant challenge as (1) there is no single administrative entity to establish and enforce security policy, (2) nodes are highly mobile and may need to interact with other nodes with which they have no previous relationship and (3) connectivity may be intermittent meaning that trusted infrastructure may not always be available. These features of pervasive computing environments mean that existing approaches to security that rely on the existence of trusted infrastructure, need well-defined network boundaries and require pre-existing relationships between the security service are unable to function. As the security field is very broad, this thesis focused on one aspect: authentication. To facilitate authentication in pervasive computing environments, we developed the Distributed Certification and Authentication Service (DCAS). DCAS acts as a distributed Certification Authority comprised of a group of trustworthy nodes that collaborate to provide the services of a Certification Authority and can be set up on-the-fly to service clusters of isolated nodes. The trusted nodes within DCAS not only issue public key certificates, but also perform authentication of applicant nodes. Applicant nodes are able to authenticate using &#8220;traditional authentication factors&#8221; (such as public key certificates), as well as context information sensed from the environment, or a combination of both. To demonstrate the viability of DCAS, its core functionality was implemented and deployed on a small IEEE 802.11b network. In order to aid in establishing a DCAS within a network, a probability-based model of DCAS behaviour under certain conditions was created. This model was verified using simulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Dualism to Wholeness: Understanding Religion and Politics in the West</field><field name="creator">Erin Wilson</field><field name="description">International Relations (IR) scholarship has largely viewed the relationship between religion and politics in the West as irrelevant, owing to dominant perceptions of the West as secular. Yet this attitude is increasingly recognised as mistaken. I argue that the significant role of religion in Western politics has gone largely unnoticed because of deeply entrenched dualistic thinking in the West. Firstly, religion and politics are viewed as separated by the public/private divide. Secondly, religion itself is understood through three dichotomies &#8211; institutional/ideational, individual/communal and irrational/rational. However, only one side of each dichotomy has been emphasised. This has resulted in a limited understanding of religion as institutional, individual and irrational. After examining the reasons for and implications of dualistic thinking, the dissertation develops a holistic definition of religion that values all six elements: institutional, ideational, individual, communal, irrational and rational. I then apply this holistic definition of religion to a case study of US foreign policy. By conducting a close textual analysis of five State of the Union addresses, I reveal how religion plays an integral role in foreign policy, a role that is generally masked by embedded dualism within the West. The application of a holistic definition of religion serves to overcome dualistic thinking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131292</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic fatigue syndrome in Queensland: An investigation of fatigue, incidence of falls and fear of falling, and balance and mobility function</field><field name="creator">Jane Anne Clarke</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in two parts, a survey study and a comparative balance and mobility pilot study. Firstly, a series of self-administered questionnaires were mailed to people in Queensland with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The main purpose of the survey study was to 1) develop a demographic and health profile of the population of people who suffer from CFS in Queensland; 2) to establish the reliability and validity of an alternate measure of fatigue, the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) and 3) to document functional mobility, history of falls and degree of fear of falling experienced by those with CFS. The average age of CFS subjects who participated in the survey study was 52 years, and 69 percent were between the ages of 40 and 70 years. Seventy-seven percent of the subjects were women. CFS subjects reported a mean duration of CFS symptoms of 16.95 years. Sixty-three percent of CFS subjects suffered from a concomitant diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Fatigue severity was measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the MAF. The mean fatigue score obtained from the FSS and the MAF was 6.3 (SD+/-0.7) and 37.81 (SD+/-6.96) respectively. The FSS (Intraclass Coefficient=0.9, p&lt;0.001) and the MAF (Intraclass Coefficient=0.84, p&lt;0.001) were highly reliable when measuring fatigue in CFS over two occasions within a one-month period. There was a weak, but significant correlation between the MAF and the FSS (Spearman&#8217;s Rank Order Coefficient=0.476, p&lt;0.001), indicating that the MAF is a reliable and valid measure of fatigue in the CFS population. Fifty-one percent of the CFS cohort reported a history of a fall occurring in the past six months, while thirty-nine percent of the total CFS cohort were identified as recurrent fallers. A fear of falling was reported by fifty-two percent of CFS subjects. The mean modified falls efficacy score for the CFS cohort was 7.7 (SD. +/-2.24). Falls and fear of falling appeared to be related to a concurrent diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The high incidence of falls and fear of falling in the CFS population prompted a pilot comparative study of balance and mobility function in women with CFS. The main aims of this study were to 1) identify the type of balance and mobility deficits experienced by a cohort of younger women with CFS; 2) to compare balance and mobility function of women with CFS to an age matched control group and 3) to identify the test conditions that are best able to differentiate the balance and mobility performance of the CFS cohort and controls. The grip strength, gaze stability and balance and mobility function of 14 females with a current diagnosis of CFS and 20 age matched control females was tested. Upper limb strength (p&lt;0.003) and dynamic visual acuity (p&lt;0.003) were significantly reduced in CFS subjects when compared to control subjects. There were no significant differences between CFS and control subjects for postural stability measures of bilateral stance on the Clinical Test of Sensory Integration of Balance. There was a strong trending increase in velocity of postural sway demonstrated when CFS females stood on a firm surface with eyes closed (p=0.018). No significant difference between the CFS cohort and the controls was demonstrated for all single leg stance (SLS) time and sway measures. However there was a strong trend for increased postural sway and less time measured for left and right SLS with eyes open. Slower reaction times when weight shifting in a mediolateral direction ((R) p=0.004, (L) p=0.007) were demonstrated in CFS subjects. CFS subjects performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, manual TUG and the combined TUG significantly slower than control subjects (p=0.001). Gait parameters were significantly different between the two groups on all 10m walk tests. CFS subjects exhibited a slower gait velocity, shorter step length, less cadence and longer duration of gait cycle. Dual tasking did not appear to effect the gait pattern of CFS subjects more than controls, however, more complex multitask conditions may have identified greater differences between the two groups. This study has demonstrated that a community based cohort of the CFS population in Queensland experience significant levels of impairment and disability associated with fatigue and other CFS symptoms, falls and perceived fear of falling. Preliminary findings suggest that people with CFS exhibit mild balance and mobility deficits and impaired upper limb strength and gaze stability. Recommendations are made regarding the future delivery of intervention programmes for people with CFS in Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131286</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity and ecology of Symbiodinium in pocilloporid corals</field><field name="creator">Sampayo, Eugenia M.</field><field name="description">The decline of coral reefs is well documented, yet a detailed understanding of the processes involved in the establishment, persistence, and ecology of the coral-dinoflagellate associations still remains largely unknown. The advent of molecular techniques has resulted in significant advances in understanding the molecular diversity present of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium, but information concerning the functional, ecological, and biogeographical significance of this expanding symbiont diversity remains limited. This thesis therefore used molecular methodologies to uncover Symbiodinium diversity in Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix at ecological scales, in response to thermal stress, and to long-term environmental shifts. In addition, all the molecular methods currently used in Symbiodinium research are critically reviewed to provide an important baseline for future studies. The application of ITS2-DGGE coupled with the integration of alternate speciation concepts and analyses showed great merit in assessing Symbiodinium diversity in S. pistillata, P. damicornis, and S. hystrix along a depth gradient (3 m to 18 m) at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia), and emphasizes that sampling regimes should focus on the role of symbionts within their functional habitat. S. pistillata associates with symbionts C78 or C35/a in shallow areas and C79 in the deep, but also harbors a generalist type C8/a that can be found at all depths. P. damicornis harbors C42/a in shallow areas while C33/a is generally found in deeper reef zones, although it is occasionally observed in the shallows. On the other hand, S. hystrix only harbors a single symbiont (C3/t) at all depths. The data from Chapter 2 therefore shows that closely related symbionts within a single clade can diverge rapidly under influence of ecological differentiation whereby each symbiont represents a separately evolving lineage that occupies a specific ecological niche. As such, closely related symbionts are likely to have evolved specializations that optimize performance within their environmental range. Previous studies have sought to explain the bleaching susceptibility of scleractinian corals as a function of the presence or absence of six major clades of Symbiodinium. In chapter 3 it is shown that sub-cladal types of clade C in S. pistillata differ in their response to thermal stress, and these differences are as large as those previously reported between different clades. Molecular (ITS2-DGGE) data is integrated with physiological measurements (PAM fluorometry, host protein, symbiont cell density) to investigate the response to stress (bleaching) and is directly related to fine-scale differences in symbiont-types. This suggests that the cladal distinction of Symbiodinium is insufficient to explain the highly variable responses commonly seen in reef-building corals. Furthermore, the results highlight that shifts in symbiont community within a host population are due to differential mortality rather than the uptake of novel symbionts. It therefore appears that changes in the thermal tolerance of corals by acquiring novel more resistant Symbiodinium to meet the challenges of global warming may be restricted, and as such cannot be expected to prevent large-scale reef degradation. Whilst most Symbiodinium cladal studies have focused on bleaching, Chapter 4 combines molecular (ITS2-DGGE) and physiological analyses (PAM fluorometry) to assess the flexibility of the coral&#8211;symbiont assemblages in S. pistillata, P. damicornis, and S. hystrix when faced with long-term shifts in key environmental conditions. To test this, a 32 month reciprocal transplant experiment was set-up on Heron Island, whereby corals were transplanted to a new light environment, i.e. shallow to deep, or deep to shallow. Although some host-symbiont combinations were able to shuffle sub-cladal symbiont types, almost all colonies reverted back to their original type within 7 to 12 months. Interestingly, transplanted colonies showed a broad acclimatory response by adjusting their physiological responses to those of the control colonies at the transplanted depth. However, those that persisted with sub-optimal symbiont types suffered disproportionate rates of mortality at the onset of additional stress (bleaching). This suggests that, despite their large acclimatory capacity, the holobiont was likely living at the limits of its tolerance range. As such, it appears that coral species cannot readily form a novel symbiotic unit by changing their symbiotic partner in response to prolonged periods of change, and it is therefore unlikely that they will be able to adjust their symbionts in an attempt to cope with changing global conditions. Finally, Chapter 5 reviews the different DNA markers (18S, 28S, ITS1, ITS2, cp23S) and screening methods (RFLP, LICOR, SSCP, DGGE, cloning-sequencing) currently applied to uncovering Symbiodinium diversity. Current rDNA markers are used to identify ancient or more recent evolutionary lineages and separate symbionts into broad groups such as clades, as well as uncovering fine-scale differences between ecologically different sub-cladal types. The 18S and 28S rDNA in combination with RFLP are appropriate for studies that focus on large groupings at the cladal level and may uncover broad biogeographical. However, studies on the ecology or physiology of host-symbiont associations clearly benefit from the capacity to detect the full level of variability present within a community (e.g. 28S-SSCP, ITS2-DGGE). Despite the suitability of the rDNA, it is an imperative that sequence information is combined with ecological data in order to accurately predict how each hostsymbiont combinations responds as a unit that is optimized to function within the range of its distribution. Symbiont types present in individual hosts are shown to be distinct cohesive groups that are not interchangeable on an ecological, functional and evolutionary scale. In summary, this thesis expands on the current knowledge of the role of Symbiodinium on coral reefs and introduces a number of novel concepts. It is imperative that effort and resources continue to be channelled to combine genetic and ecological studies on Symbiodinium, as they appear to be an important factor driving responses of their host. Although diversity assessments would benefit from the development of a single-copy molecular marker, it is important to continue utilizing current methodologies to increase our knowledge of coral-symbiont diversity if we are to understand and manage coral reefs in the short-term as environmental conditions continue to change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270401 Plant Systematics, Taxonomy and Phylogeny</field><field name="subject">270702 Marine and Estuarine Ecology (incl.

Whether micropredators similarly affect marine ecosystems and hosts is not well understood. In coral reef fish communities, the most abundant micropredators are isopods, in particular, gnathiids. Our understanding of how isopods affect fishes has been restricted by a lack of information regarding basic isopod biology including; patterns of abundance, parasite identity, host specificity and host pathology. Also it is unknown if small juvenile fish are parasitised by isopods, and if this affects their survival. Sequentially, the aims of my PhD thesis were to understand the ecology of several lesser known parasites in sufficient detail to perform manipulative experiments that could test the effects of micropredation on small juvenile reef fish. All field studies took place at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef My first study aimed to describe temporal and spatial patterns of isopod abundance by measuring emergence rates. Gnathiid isopod juveniles emerge from the benthos into the water column to find hosts or change locations. Although diel patterns have been demonstrated, the relationship between substrate and emergence on coral reefs is not clear. I measured emergence rates of parasitic isopods (Gnathiidea and Flabellifera) in 6 &#8220;habitats&#8221; at 2 very different sites at Lizard Island. Isopods were collected from the periphery and centres of 3 sizes of reef, and from the substrate between these reefs (sand or rubble). At both sites, the most abundant gnathiid species (Gnathia falcipenis and Gnathia sp C), was exclusive to that site. Although strong diel patterns in emergence were observed, gnathiid abundance could not be predicted by habitat. However, gnathiids were larger and more often fed over reef borders than in the centres of reefs. To explain these patterns, I suggested that first stage larvae had the largest influence on total abundance and were patchily distributed in accordance with adults from which they had recently hatched. As later stage larvae also depend on fish, more successful (fed and older larvae) are found on the edges of reefs where appropriate hosts may be more abundant. Gnathiids were over-dispersed in all habitats investigated, including apparently homogeneous beds of coral rubble and sand. This indicated that gnathiid distribution may be better predicted by very fine scale differences in substrate, or that larvae are simply gregarious, and that abundance may be difficult to predict on the basis of substrate. Without reliable differences in parasite abundance among habitats at Lizard Island, subsequent studies would rely on manipulating parasite abundance via excluding wild parasites in the field (which proved very difficult) or by controlling abundance in laboratory simulations. I then investigated host specificity in the 2 most abundant gnathiid species from the previous study. Discrete species distributions between the two sites suggested that the 2 parasites may have had different diets. Host-specificity data for gnathiid isopods are scarce because the parasitic juvenile stages are difficult to identify and host-parasite contact is often brief. Engorged third stage gnathiids were photographed and permitted to moult into adults to allow identification. I compared mtDNA sequences from their blood meals to host sequences available on GenBank. The host frequency distributions used by each species were significantly different; only four host families were shared. I concluded that G. falcipenis and Gnathia sp C operate as preferential feeders. Importantly, this work showed that G. falcipenis was indeed a natural parasite of several species of damselfish (Pomacentridae) that could be collected as young recruits and used in manipulative experiments. I then used G. falcipenis as a model parasite to investigate the effects of isopods on recently recruited Dischistodus perspicillatus and small juvenile Acanthochromis polyacanthus damselfishes. Working with honours student Ms Rose Penfold, we determined that A. polyacanthus was infected by gnathiids in the wild at sizes as small as 4.2 mm SL. Laboratory infections revealed that larger A. polyacanthus were much better at eating gnathiids, a behaviour which prevented infection, and that smaller fish were more likely to die post-infection. Infection prevalence was &gt; 3 % during the day, but we could not sample fish for nocturnal infection prevalence. A caging experiment suggested that most micropredation on damselfish took place at night. For D. perspicillatus, I found that exposure to 2 parasites each evening for 7 nights after settlement halved the growth of these fish. Lastly, numerous free-swimming cymothoid isopods were found associated with larval fish in light traps. Cymothoids have a multi-morphic life cycle composed of micropredatory stages that eventually become females, which are permanently attached to fishes. Because cymothoid taxonomy is based around female morphology, natatory-stage cymothoids can not be identified. I sequenced mtDNA from natatory and adult female life history stages and matched 4 of 11 natatory cymothoid morphotypes. Molecular data were also used to produce a phylogeny exploring the evolution of different forms of host attachment within the Cymothoidae. This phylogeny suggests that external attachment, formerly thought to be plesiomorphic, is a derived condition and has evolved several times independently. I suggest that attachment to the buccal cavity or gills is a primitive form of attachment. This research has provided information on emergence patterns and hostspecificity which is necessary for the future study of isopod vector biology. It also provides a platform for future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on cymothoids. I demonstrate that gnathiids infect juvenile coral reef fish and suggest that they may influence survival both directly and indirectly by reducing growth and predisposing infected fish to size-selective mortality. Thus, interactions between isopod micropredators and recruiting fishes may determine the survivorship of individual fish and influence the subsequent community structure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300700 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="subject">270703 Terrestrial Ecology</field><field name="subject">270304 Infectious Agents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132177</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models and frameworks that enhance systematic planning for coral reef biodiversity conservation</field><field name="creator">Beger, Maria</field><field name="description">The global decline of coral reef biodiversity requires rapid, efficient and practical solutions. No-take marine reserves and reserve systems and other managed marine conservation areas are currently considered one of the most effective management methods to deal with this ongoing decline. Although the effects, design, and establishment of coral reef reserves have been widely debated in the literature, few examples of systematic approaches to the design of reserve systems exist. Systematic conservation planning is a procedure to prioritise sites for their inclusion in reserve systems based on data and a set of conservation principles. For coral reefs the systematic design of reserve systems has been hampered by the lack of spatially explicit data, and the lack of practical recommendations to resource managers of how to apply new scientific findings. This thesis fills critical gaps at the interface between theory, planning, and implementation of coral reef reserve systems, and provides practical guidance to reef managers. In the first chapter, literature on marine reserves is discussed and the implications for coral reef reserves are considered. Chapter 2 discusses the lessons learned in the design and implementation of a community-based marine reserve in the Philippines. Reviewing relevant literature, a framework of &#8216;lessons learnt&#8217; during the establishment of local protected areas is presented, highlighting the importance of a number of factors that are vital to the success of these reserves: (a) an island location; (b) small community population size; (c) minimal effect of land-based development; (d) application of a bottom-up approach; (e) an external facilitating institution; (f) acquisition of title; (g) use of a scientific information database; (h) stakeholder involvement; (i) the establishment of legislation; (j) community empowerment; (k) alternative livelihood schemes; (l) surveillance; (m) tangible management results; (n) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and (o) small-scale project expansion. To manage coral reef species it is important to understand the processes that influence their distribution. Chapter 3 identifies the environmental factors most influential in determining coral reef fish species distributions on a regional scale. Logistic regression models for 227 fish species related presence-absence data to four remotely determined environmental predictor variables: depth 500 m away from a reef, presence of a land-sea interface, exposure, and the distance to the nearest estuary. A novel method of evaluating model significance identified suitable models for 134 species. All four predictor variables were important for the distributions of the chosen suite of fishes. Depth was the most frequently significant variable in single variable models, and the proximity of a reef to an island was the least frequently important variable. For combinations of two predictor variables, depth and exposure as well as depth and distance from the nearest estuary were the prevalent predictors of fish distributions. Several fish species responded to the combination of the distance from an estuary and the presence of the terrestrial-marine interface, indicating that these species depend on intact coastal reef habitat, which is in decline near the main sediment-laden rivers. Significant models were predominantly developed for habitat specific species. These habitat specific species are of greater conservation concern than widespread species because of their restricted range, or because threats affect them more severely if they are selectively affecting their habitat. For this reason, species distribution modelling may be an efficient method to inform reserve design. The relevance of cross-taxon congruence to the suitability of taxa as conservation representation surrogates of coral reef biodiversity across the Indo-Pacific is tested in Chapter 4, using species lists of fishes, corals, and molluscs. Congruence is identified with a linear regression analysis of dissimilarity values. The utility of a surrogate was determined by the degree to which each taxon can represent the others in a marine reserve network using a greedy reserve selection algorithm. None of the taxonomic groups examined was capable of acting as a general conservation representation surrogate. Even a data-rich taxon like fishes could be severely under-represented in reserve systems designed based on a surrogate taxon such as corals, implying that data-deficient taxa are unlikely to be represented adequately where surrogate taxa are used for planning. Despite the high cross-taxon congruence between fishes and corals, and between corals and molluscs for some regions, cross-taxon congruence was not always a reliable indicator of conservation representation surrogacy. Consequently, in Indo-Pacific coral reef ecosystems one can only be sure that a target taxon is represented fully in a marine reserve network when data on this taxon are used to select reserve sites. The fifth chapter provides a theoretical and practical framework for incorporating ecological processes that span terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environmental realms into systematic conservation planning. Firstly the types of processes are classified as interactions that exist: a) on narrow interfaces such as inter-tidal zones; b) on broad interfaces such as mangrove swamps; c) along constrained connections such as corridors used by amphibian movements between natal ponds and adult habitat; and d) through diffuse connections like bird migrations. A framework of conservation planning approaches to promote the persistence of these types of processes and examples of how they might be implemented is developed. The framework focuses both on problem formulations consistent with existing decision support tools, such as the conservation planning software MARXAN, and on new methods. The review is aimed at a broad audience of scientists, planners, and managers and takes a practical and illustrative approach, providing examples of existing work and pointing readers to tools that are available to enhance conservation planning across realms. In the concluding chapter ideas from all chapters are synthesised. This chapter discusses how the approaches and frameworks presented here could be extended, and profitable areas for future research are suggested. Overall this thesis provides new insights, concepts, and tools that can assist reef managers and scientists struggling to minimise the loss of coral reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132162</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular epidemiology of yellow head-complex viruses of cultured prawns in the Asian region</field><field name="creator">Wijegoonawardane, Priyanjalie K. M.</field><field name="description">Yellow head virus (YHV) is highly pathogenic and was identified as the cause of mass mortalities associated with yellow head disease (YHD) that first appeared in Penaeus monodon farmed in Thailand in 1990. By 1992-1993, YHD was widespread throughout the Thai shrimp farming industry, causing losses estimated at ~US$70 million per annum. By the mid 1990s, gross signs consistent with YHD were also being reported in P. monodon farmed in many regions of the Indo-Pacific. Due to its high pathogenicity and economic impact, YHV has been listed as a notifiable pathogen by the OIE and the control of YHD remains a significant concern. At the outset of this study, two genotypic variants of YHV (genotype 1) had been detected in P. monodon in Australia (gill-associated virus, GAV, genotype 2) and Vietnam (genotype 3), suggesting that more variants might exist in other regions. The aim of this study was, therefore, to test the hypothesis that genotypic variants existed in P. monodon from other locations, and if so, to determine their genetic relationships to the three known genotypes. The study also aimed to improve existing PCR diagnostic protocols to accommodate the detection of all genotypes in the YHV complex. Fifty-seven field isolates of YH-complex viruses were detected by RT-PCR in tissues of P. monodon sampled from nine Indo-Pacific countries. Phylogenetic relationships determined for these isolates using a 671 nucleotide (nt) C-terminal region of the ORF1b gene identified 46 isolates that clustered with the three know genotypes and 11 isolates that clustered in at least three distinct new genotypes. All isolates other than genotype 1 (YHV) were detected in tissues of healthy shrimp. Genotype 4 isolates were detected only in shrimp from India and were slightly less distantly related at the nucleotide level to genotype 5 (85.2% identify) than the other genotypes (80.3%-82.3%). Genotype 6 isolates were only detected in shrimp from Mozambique and were least divergent (3.5%) from genotype 2. One each of three genotype 5 isolates was detected in shrimp from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The genotype 5 isolate from the Philippines was, however, 6.7% and 7% divergent from the other two isolates, respectively. This level of divergence was greater than found between genotypes 2 and 6 and was similar to that found between isolates of genotype 2 and genotype 3 (~6.7%). This suggests that the Philippine genotype 5 isolate might ultimately be considered as the founding member of a seventh genotype. Genotype 5 isolates were slightly more closely related to genotype 4 (~85.2% identity) than the other genotypes (83.4%-84.8% identity). Genotype 1 (YHV) isolates were only detected in Thai shrimp affected by YHD. Genotype 2 isolates were detected in Australian shrimp as well as shrimp from Vietnam and Thailand. Genotype 3 had the broadest geographic range, being detected in four countries in Southeast Asia. The finding of single genotypes in Australia (genotype 2), India (genotype 4) and Mozambique (genotype 6) supports the hypothesis that they have evolved independently in geographically-isolated populations of P. monodon. The detection of multiple genotypes in Vietnam (genotypes 2 and 3), Malaysia (genotypes 2, 3 and 5) and Thailand (genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 5) suggests that these genotypes have been disseminated by movements of infected P. monodon and the trade in live broodstock used for aquaculture. A ~1.3 kb amplicon at the 5&#8217;-terminal region of the ORF3 gene was sequenced for 28 field isolates to examine phylogenetic relationships to assess whether there is evidence of recombination between genotypes. The region, corresponding to N-terminus of gp116 envelope glycoprotein, displayed more sequence variation than the ORF1b amplicon. All isolates of the virulent genotype 1 (YHV) possessed a unique sequence (TILAGIPEKE/D) at the N terminus of gp116 adjacent to the site of endo-proteolysis that cleaves gp116 from the ORF3 polyprotein. In some genotype 1 isolates this unique sequence was followed by a 54 aa deletion that was also not present in other genotypes. The potential role of this unique sequence as a virulence determinant for YHV requires further investigation. Phylogenetic relationships deduced using the ORF3 amplicon sequences were similar to those deduced using the ORF1b amplicon sequence except that genotype 4 was more closely related to genotype 2 than was genotype 3. However, only 18 of the 28 isolates included in the analysis of both ORF1b and ORF3 amplicons clustered in consistent lineages and were assigned as the same genotypes. Inconsistent phylogenies were observed for ten isolates of which six clustered as genotype 3 in ORF1b and as genotype 2 in ORF3, two isolates clustered as genotype 3 in ORF1b and as genotype 5 in ORF3, one isolate clustered as genotype 5 in ORF1b and as genotype 2 in ORF3, and one isolate clustered as genotype 5 in ORF1b and as genotype 3 in ORF3. Discrepancies in genotype assignments were only observed to involve permutations of genotypes 2, 3 and 5 and involved isolates from healthy shrimp originating from Southeast Asia. Sequence analysis of the ~3.2 kb region spanned by the ORF1b and ORF3 amplicons of three putative recombinant viruses VNM-02-H258 (genotype 3/5), IDN-04-H10 (genotype 3/2) and PHL-03-H8 (genotype 5/3) indicated that recombination had occurred at a position just upstream of the ORF1b gene 3&#8217;-terminus. These data provide the first evidence of genetic recombination for any shrimp virus. The high prevalence of recombinants amongst isolates from Southeast Asia has significant implications for diversification, disease emergence and assignment of genotypes for YH-complex viruses. The region of the genome from the poly[A] tail to the 3&#8217;-end of the ORF1b gene (containing all structural protein genes) was sequenced for representative isolates of genotypes 3 and 4. The analysis was conducted to determine whether the evolutionary divergence in the structural protein genes differed significantly from the replicase (ORF1b) gene and to identify conserved motifs likely to be important for protein function and the regulation of RNA transcription and replication. The sequence of the near 3&#8217;-terminal genome region of a genotype 5 isolate was also determined to examine whether it possessed an ORF4 gene like genotype 2 or whether it was truncated as in genotypes 1, 3 and 4. Comparisons of the intergenic regions (IGR) upstream of ORF2 and ORF3 identified a conserved sequence 5&#8217;-GUCAAUUACACxxAxxUU-3&#8217; surrounding the central adenosine residue corresponding to the 5&#8217;-terminus of the sub-genomic (sg)mRNAs that is likely to represent the consensus motif used as a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). A sequence upstream of ORF4 possessed limited homology to the predicted consensus TRS but A&gt;G/U substitutions (genotypes 2, 3, 4 and 5) or a point deletion (genotype 1) occurred at the central critical adenosine residue. It is possible that these mutations explain why a sgmRNA is not transcribed in abundance to allow translation of an ORF4 protein, and why the apparently redundant ORF4 gene has accumulated nucleotide deletions or insertions interrupting its reading in all genotypes except genotype 2. The 3&#8217;-terminal genome sequence of genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 downstream of the putative ORF4 gene region was extremely highly conserved and was predicted to form a stable hairpin-loop RNA secondary structure with four bulges. Where nucleotide variations occurred in a genotype, other compensatory changes maintained base-pairing and stability of the structure, suggesting that this region is likely to be important for polymerase recognition of the (+) genomic RNA for transcription of (-) genomic RNA. Conventional and real-time PCR tests for the detection of all genotypes in the YH complex were developed by identifying highly conserved sequences amongst the 57 virus isolates at which primers could be targeted. In the consensus RT-nested PCR, PCR (358 bp) and nested PCR (147 bp) amplicon lengths were kept short to accommodate degraded RNA and pools of two primers were used rather than a single degenerate primer to accommodate all genotypes whist minimizing levels of degeneracy. The consensus real-time PCR used SYBR-Green chemistry and amplified a 147 bp product using single degenerate primers targeted to the same sites as the nested PCR primer pools. Each PCR method detected the RNA of representatives of all six genotypes. The RT-nested PCR was extremely sensitive, detecting down to a single copy of a GAV synthetic RNA. Phylogenetic analysis using the 95 nt sequence bounded by the nested PCR primers generated genotype associations similar to those generated using the 671 nt sequence, allowing the assignment of genotypes from the amplified products. The consensus RT-nested PCR test has been included in the 5th Edition of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (2006). The consensus real-time PCR was slightly less sensitive than the RT-nested PCR, detecting down to ~125 copies of the GAV synthetic RNA. However, the test generated products with the expected Tm (77.5&#186;C) with isolates of the six genotypes and showed a linear relationship between input RNA and Ct value up to 109 RNA copies. Thus, due to its ability to accurately quantify and compare viral RNA loads in clinical samples, the test could be used to define the infection status of shrimp in relation to threshold levels associated with disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yellow head virus</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">prawn farms</field><field name="subject">shrimp farming</field><field name="subject">Penaeus monodon</field><field name="subject">pathogens</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132213</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Activity, Sedentary Time and Blood Glucose in Australian Adults</field><field name="creator">Healy, Genevieve</field><field name="description">Background: Chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations are both a characteristic and a precursor of type 2 diabetes. Elevated blood glucose has also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. This risk is progressive, and extends both below and above established cut-points of risk. Physical activity and sedentary (sitting) time are modifiable behaviours that are independently associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. However, there is limited information on the associations of physical activity and sedentary time with continuous measures of fasting plasma glucose and 2-hr postload plasma glucose. Aim: Using both self-report and objective measures, the set of studies reported in this Thesis examined the independent and joint associations of physical activity and sedentary time with continuous blood glucose measures in a cross-sectional sample of Australian adults without known diabetes. Methods: The population-based Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study was initially conducted in 1999-2000, and repeated in 2004-2005. The associations of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity and sedentary (television viewing) time utilise the 1999- 2000 AusDiab data (n=9,214). Additionally, an accelerometer was used to objectively measure physical activity and sedentary time in a sub-sample (n=204) of 2004-2005 AusDiab participants. Fasting plasma glucose and 2-hr plasma glucose were measured by an oral glucose tolerance test at both time points. Results: Across the four studies reported, increased time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity was significantly associated with lower 2-hr plasma glucose; increased sedentary time was significantly associated with higher 2-hr plasma glucose. These findings were observed for both the self-report and the objective data, and were independent of each other. No significant associations were observed with fasting plasma glucose for either the self-report or the objective-measures. Even in those who met the National Physical Activity Guidelines (30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days of the week), increased television viewing time was associated with significantly elevated 2-hr plasma glucose. Importantly, the objective data showed that lightintensity activity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous intensity time, was significantly beneficially associated with 2-hr plasma glucose. Additionally, the objective data provided preliminary evidence that regularly breaking up sedentary time, independent of total sedentary time, was beneficially associated with 2-hr plasma glucose. Conclusions: These set of findings highlight the importance, particularly for 2-hr plasma glucose, of increasing time spent in physical activity and decreasing time spent in sedentary behaviours. The findings also suggest that substituting light-intensity activities for television time, or other sedentary behaviours, may be a practical and achievable preventive strategy to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Prospective data analyses, as well as experimental studies are required to investigate the possible causal nature of these observations and the mechanisms that may underlie them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132230</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Myosin VI in E-cadherin Adhesive Contact Biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Maddugoda, Madhavi</field><field name="description">The architecture of epithelial monolayers is critically influenced by the adhesion-mediating signalling receptor, E-cadherin. E-cadherin has long been known to be fundamental for maintaining cell-cell cohesion and cell-cell junctional integrity, and this relies on its close association with the actin cytoskeleton. The exact underlying molecular mechanism of Ecadherin-actin cooperation at contacts is, however, poorly understood. Analysing the many effector proteins that mediate the cadherin-actin interaction is the first step toward a clearer understanding of this interaction. The interaction between E-cadherin and actin is complex. This is likely due to the dynamic nature of intercellular contacts. A pertinent example of the dynamic evolution of cell-cell contacts is seen when cell contacts mature in relation to one another over a period of time. Here, initial discontinuous contacts are replaced by continuous linear contacts and cadherin and actin morphologies undergo a concomitant transformation. In this study I have identified a molecular pathway that is necessary for this intercellular contact maturation process. I now report that Myosin VI critically regulates the morphogenesis of epithelial cellcell contacts. When epithelial monolayers mature in culture, Myosin VI is recruited to cell contacts as they become linear and cohesive, where it forms a biochemical complex with Ecadherin. Myosin VI is necessary for strong cadherin adhesion, for cells to form cohesive linear contacts, and for the integrity of the apical junctional complex. Importantly, I found that vinculin mediates this effect of Myosin VI. In the absence of Myosin VI, vinculin is lost from cell-cell contacts and is unable to interact with E-cadherin. Further, vinculin is able to rescue contact integrity even in the absence of Myosin VI, thus identifying vinculin as a downstream effector of Myosin VI necessary for the biogenesis of intercellular contacts. Together this shows that the actin effector proteins, Myosin VI and vinculin, form a molecular apparatus that generates cohesive cell-cell contacts in cultured mammalian epithelia. From a broader perspective, this work emphasises the dynamic nature of cadherinactin interactions at cell-cell contacts and its regulation by the recruitment of specific actin effectors in a time-and context-dependent manner.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270200 Genetics</field><field name="subject">270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Units Of Genetic Transfer In Prokaryotes</field><field name="creator">Chan, Cheong Xin</field><field name="description">The transfer of genetic material and integration of the material into a genome via recombination are important in gene repair, maintenance of genetic variation, and initiation of DNA replication in prokaryotes. Lateral transfer of genetic materials between two species creates mosaic phylogenetic relationships in different regions across genomes, complicating the inference of a single species phylogeny based on gene sequences. To date, most studies of genetic transfer in prokaryotes have been restricted by the implicit assumption that the units of genetic transfer are whole genes. This thesis documents the implementation of a rigorous phylogenetic approach in the first systematic study of the unit of genetic transfer in prokaryotes. Two core aspects of the thesis are reviewed in detail: (a) the modelling of sequence changes in the study of molecular evolution, and (b) the detection of recombination (thus genetic transfer) in molecular sequences. A &#8216;shotgun&#8217; strategy is adopted to obtain optimal sequence alignments for subsequent analysis of genetic transfer, in which multiple alignments resulting from various algorithms were validated using a novel pattern-centric objective function presented in this work. A two-phase strategy is introduced to detect recombination at large scale: simple statistical tests are used to detect phylogenetic discrepancies within a group of sequences, and a rigorous Bayesian phylogenetic approach is then used to locate more precisely the breakpoints at which the recombination occurred. To formulate this strategy, an extensive benchmark study on various recombination-detecting approaches was conducted using simulated sequence data, focusing on the effects of subsequent evolutionary events in obscuring recombination. The alignment and recombination-detection strategies were applied to analyse the units of genetic transfer in (a) single-copy gene families from 144 prokaryote genomes and in (b) single-copy and multicopy gene families from 13 Staphylococcus genomes. In prokaryotes, within-gene (fragmentary) genetic transfer is generally more frequent than whole-gene transfer in singlecopy gene families. In Staphylococcus, however, both within-gene and whole-gene transfer contribute almost evenly. The units of fragmentary genetic transfer are found to correlate with protein structural features. A significant functional bias of whole-gene transfer was observed in single-copy and in multi-copy gene families of Staphylococcus, suggesting that fixation of an exogenous gene is influenced by the presence of similar gene copies in the target genome. This work demonstrates that units of genetic transfer in prokaryotes are not restricted to whole genes, and the extent of genetic transfer in prokaryotes could have been underestimated. The results support the view that both genetic transfer and gene duplication contribute to functional innovation in prokaryote genomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132182</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Background Oriented Schlieren Technique for Flow Visualisation in Shock Tunnels</field><field name="creator">Ramanah, Dwishen</field><field name="description">The Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) technique is a method that has been developed recently for easily and inexpensively visualizing density gradient variations in compressible flows.

K.</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease is the single greatest contributor to mortality within developed countries in our time. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, both of which are potent risk factors for coronary heart disease, are common conditions with rapidly rising rates of prevalence both globally and in Australia. Within Australia, Indigenous Australians suffer from disproportionately high rates of diabetes, obesity and coronary heart disease, the reason for which lies, in part, with changes in dietary intake and decreased levels of physical activity over the past 200 years. These disease trends have led to a substantially reduced life expectancy from an increase in excess cardiovascular deaths in Indigenous Australians. Assessment of cardiovascular risk in Indigenous Australians is complicated by ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk factors and their prevalence. There is also evidence that Indigenous Australians are genetically predisposed to diabetes. Current cardiovascular risk stratification algorithms are suboptimal, significantly underestimating risk in Indigenous Australians. This thesis aimed to address these issues. Firstly, to evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention programme to sustainably improve markers of health outcome in a cohort of Indigenous Australians who were overweight or had type 2 diabetes mellitus by improving diet and physical activity levels. Secondly, to evaluate the utility of anthropometric markers of obesity, ultrasound markers of atherosclerotic burden and serum C-reactive protein as additional cardiovascular risk stratification tools. The Healthy Lifestyle Programme (HELP) was a two year prospective intervention study designed and implemented with substantial input from the Indigenous community. The primary intervention consisted of a series of educational workshops delivered predominantly by Indigenous health workers advocating improving diet and increasing physical activity. To complement these workshops, facilities were established within the community to support dietary improvement and increased physical activity. Sustainable changes to markers of cardiovascular outcome, including significant reductions in central obesity and blood pressure were demonstrated over time. A slowing in the deterioration of renal function as marked by albuminuria was also detected. These beneficial changes were accompanied by increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. In a substudy, individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype, who were dyslipidaemic at baseline, benefited from lipid profiles that improved significantly during the course of the study. Changes in blood pressure and central obesity detected during the course of the project are likely to have significant clinical impact on health outcomes considering their sustained nature. Evaluating ultrasound imaging based markers of cardiovascular risk, carotid artery intimal medial thickness was a more reliable measure of risk based on its firm correlation with established cardiovascular risk factors compared to brachial artery flow mediated vasodilatation. Carotid artery intimal medial thickness may be the better surrogate marker to improve cardiovascular risk stratification in the Indigenous population. Examining anthropometric markers of obesity, body mass index and waist circumference but not waist hip ratio correlated well with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, both body mass index and waist circumference predicted insulin resistance fairly well using threshold values derived from receiver operating characteristics curve analyses. Both body mass index and waist circumference were simple to perform with a high degree of reproducibility between observers and will likely be valuable additional cardiovascular risk stratification tools. Raised inflammatory stress, as marked by elevated serum C-reactive protein levels, was found in individuals with diabetes or obesity. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with carotid artery intimal medial thickness, suggesting that C-reactive protein raises cardiovascular risk by means other than increasing atherosclerotic burden. Genotyping a small random sample of our the C-reactive protein gene promoter region. This SNP was found to independently increase serum C-reactive protein in the Framingham cohort. A genetic basis for increased inflammatory stress may contribute to coronary heart disease in Indigenous Australians. In summary, a community centred lifestyle intervention programme was efficacious in producing sustainable improvement in markers of health outcome. Examination of additional cardiovascular risk markers in the Indigenous community have provided evidence for using carotid artery intimal medial thickness, waist circumference, body mass index and serum C-reactive protein levels to improve cardiovascular risk stratification. These additional tools would allow for more specific resource allocation to target individuals at highest cardiovascular risk for preventative management. C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms, their contribution to circulating C-reactive protein levels and cardiovascular outcomes warrants further investigation in the Indigenous population. A more proactive risk management plan, which includes a lifestyle intervention component, may yield the greatest improvement in long term health outcomes if targeted at younger members of the Indigenous community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321003 Cardiology (incl.

Mathematical Conservation</field><field name="creator">Michael Bode</field><field name="description">Global conservation efforts are hampered by two fundamental limitations. First, there are not enough resources available to halt the destruction of vulnerable ecosystems, or to repair and manage those that have already been degraded. Second, the information required to inform effective conservation decisions is generally unavailable. Uncertainty surrounds the dynamics of the ecosystems themselves, the nature of the threatening processes, and the effects of conservation interventions. If conservation is to be effective, management plans must acknowledge and address these two fundamental limitations. All of the research in this thesis addresses one, or both of these limitations. In particular, each chapter focuses on the management of a conservation system using mathematical optimization techniques from the field of decision theory. A decision theory approach acknowledges the central role played by these limitations in the decision-making process - only by formally incorporating them can managers maximise the outcomes of the conservation system. In Chapters 3 &amp; 4, techniques are developed to efficiently share limited conservation resources between sets of high priority regions. The analyses in Chapter 3 apply existing allocation techniques to the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, and assess whether further research into the global richness distribution of relatively unknown taxa is necessary for effective conservation, or whether existing information on well-known taxa is sufficient. Chapter 4 demonstrates how optimal control theory can provide optimal solutions to the resource allocation problem, and insight into the motivations behind the best resource allocation strategy. Chapter 5 outlines methods for optimally managing cycling predator-prey systems that experience stochastic fluctuations. This stochasticity affects the dynamics of both speCies, and their response to management interventions, in an unpredictable way. Despite this uncertainty, the application of suitable mathematical methods allows the development of efficient management strategies. Chapters 6 &amp; 7 focus on ecosystems that can be described as metapopulations. In particular, these chapters concentrate on the "connectivity" between the individual populations in such systems. Through a more accurate description of this connectivity, novel analytic methods described in Chapter 6 are able to rapidly estimate the viability of species existing in fragmented populations, and to identify patches with the highest conservation priority. Marine metapopulations are the focus of Chapter 7, in particular those of a threatened coral reef fish species. While connectivity is an important determinant of species' persistence, this process is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. The research outlined in this chapter circumvents this lack of information by identifying reef characteristics that, in the right circumstances, act as surrogates that can ensure demographically important connectivity is protected. The research reported in this thesis is applied to different conservation problems, and uses a range of mathematical techniques. Nonetheless, the objective in each chapter is to overcome the two fundamental limitations of conservation situations - resources and knowledge - by identifying and incorporating them into the decision-making process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151286</field><field

name="creator">White, Campbell John</field><field name="description">Recent geopolitical events have focused debate about immigration in Western nations on Muslim immigrants and the role of Islamic culture in these societies. Several commentators have noted that Muslims have become increasingly &#8216;othered&#8217; by the mass-media, and that Muslim culture has been portrayed as incompatible with, and a potential threat to, the dominant Western culture (Manning, 2006). In Australia, which officially adopted a policy of multiculturalism more than 40 years ago, public opinion polls suggest that while support for the policy remains strong, many believe that certain cultural groups are not compatible with Australian society (Dunn, Forrest, Burnley, &amp; McDonald, 2004). This has important implications, as recent research into acculturation preferences of dominant groups in other Western nations suggests that acceptance of cultural maintenance may not extend to cultures which are regarded as incompatible or which are perceived as threatening the cultural status quo (Florack, Piontkowski, Rohman, Balzer, &amp; Perzig, 2003; Montreuil &amp; Bourhis, 2001). This research program sought to investigate the role of perceived threat in tolerance of Muslim practice in Australia, with a focus on the impact of media portrayals. Recent research suggests that media may influence the criteria which members of dominant groups use when making decisions about acculturation practices (e.g., Domke, McCoy, &amp; Torres, 1999). In a similar vein, this research pursued an information-processing perspective, seeking to demonstrate that accessible media exemplars of Muslims in conflict with others lead those who are reliant on the mass-media to take symbolic threat into consideration when making decisions about tolerance of Muslim cultural practice. Five studies were conducted, the first three using survey methodology, and the latter two using experimental designs. Study 1 demonstrated that Australians who were more reliant on television as a source of information considered issues such as terrorism and interethnic tension more important than those who were less reliant on television and that television reliance was more strongly associated with concern about both issues than either general or genre-specific levels of television viewing, (Ball-Rokeach &amp; DeFleur, 1976; Rubin, Perse, &amp; Taylor, 1988). Study 2 demonstrated that tolerance of Muslim practice in Australia was explained largely by general attitudes to multiculturalism, but that symbolic threat played an independent role in predicting tolerance for those who were reliant on the media. Study 3 replicated this finding, and demonstrated that it was symbolic threat rather than other forms of threat identified by Stephan and Stephan&#8217;s (1996) integrated threat theory which interacted with media reliance to predict tolerance of Muslim practice. Busselle and Shrum (2003) have suggested that media influences later decision making by making relevant exemplars more accessible in memory for those who use media frequently. In Study 4 participants read a transcript of a fictitious television interview describing a conflict between Muslims and Christians in Belarus, and then recalled examples of similar events. Results indicated that media reliance was positively associated with greater recall of events involving Muslims, and negatively associated with perceived difficulty of recall, providing support for the notion that the media reliant have more accessible exemplars of Muslim conflict. Study 5 aimed to demonstrate that the accessibility of such exemplars among the media reliant is the key factor explaining the interplay between media reliance and perceived threat on tolerance of Muslim practice observed in Studies 2 and 3. It sought to do so by comparing the responses of participants who first recalled an example of either a natural disaster (the control condition) or an act of terrorism (the experimental condition designed to make salient stereotypes about Muslims). As expected, among participants for whom terrorism was not made salient, symbolic threat predicted tolerance only for those high in media reliance (who ostensibly have accessible exemplars) &#8211; consistent with the results of Studies 2 and 3. However, among participants for whom terrorism was made salient, threat predicted tolerance even among those low in media reliance. Taken together, the research provides insight into an important real-world issue, tolerance of Muslim cultural practice in Australia. It demonstrates the role of both multicultural ideology and symbolic threat and makes a unique theoretical contribution to acculturation research regarding the mechanism by which the media may influence tolerance of minorities in multicultural societies.

The impact of change on the socio-spatial structure of postmodern cities is measured, the spatial patterns are quantified and the continuing applicability of the classic models is determined. A generalised pattern of social structure in a tourist city is identified and a stage of development model of spatial patterns is proposed to promote understanding of socio-spatial structure in postmodern cities. In this analysis of social structure in the recently developed tourist city of Gold Coast, physical, economic, social and political forces were found to have created a distinctive environment, an environment that, in turn, influenced the type of social structure, the spatial patterns of social variation that emerged and how these changed over time. Principal components analysis and cluster analysis were used to identify the main dimensions of social structure and their spatial representation in this tourist city at 1991 and again in 1996. The emergence of socio-economic status and family status, albeit with a number of minor dimensions and new sub-dimensions, showed that social structure in this city was fundamentally similar to that identified earlier in modern cities. These main dimensions reflected family structure, occupational and income status, while minor dimensions were associated with ethnicity and mobility. However, some change in the dimensions was identified in this research. Socio-economic status changed most over the five-year period to reveal two new sub-dimensions of social differentiation related to employment status and employment disadvantage, while family status also split to reflect new social differences according to age. These new sub-dimensions emerged from the analysis due to their growing importance in the postmodern city. Over time, these sub-dimensions have begun to account for more of the social variation in the increasingly complex contemporary city. Together these dimensions reflect a complicated interwoven social structure in contrast to the simple patterns of social structure previously identified in modern cities. The newly identified sub-dimensions are however, able to be described in terms of the commonly recognised three main dimensions of social structure and relate to aspects of employment status, employment disadvantage and lifestyle. When comparing the spatial patterns of social structure in this city to the classic sector and zone models of the modern city, some substantial differences emerged. In modern cities, socio-economic status most commonly varied in a sectoral fashion while family status varied by zone. However, in this research, socio-economic status and family status were each found to vary in both a sectoral fashion and in a zonal pattern. In another difference to the spatial patterns of the modern city, these neat zonal patterns were further complicated by the influence of secondary nodes of activity. Three such nodes were identified. Thus, the multi-nucleated settlement pattern was seen to be exerting its own influence on socio-spatial structure resulting in a complex pattern of over-lapping zones from each node. Compared with other cities, several differences in the socio-spatial structure of Australian postmodern cities were uncovered. Ethnicity did not exert as large an influence on social structure as in American or English cities. The relatively small Australian public housing sector prevented the emergence of concentrations of this type of housing being found in this postmodern city. Similarly, edge cities and concentrations of the global elite were not identified in this setting yet are typically found in American urban areas. According to the stage of development model proposed in this research, there is a range of possibilities in the socio-spatial structure of a postmodern city. The common main dimensions of social structure are likely to be in evidence but will probably split into a number of sub-dimensions reflecting the growing complexity of social differentiation in the postmodern city, as well as each city&#8217;s particular stage of development. Other minor dimensions will reflect the characteristics of the specific city. The possibilities described in this model also extend to variations in the spatial patterns of a postmodern city. One scenario involves the expansion of an expanding urban region to gradually encompass a number of previously separated nodes. The spatial patterns uncovered in this research into a contemporary tourist city were found to revolve around a number of related, but previously separated, nodes rather than a single dominant centre. This research concluded that, in the contemporary tourist city investigated, there remained strong evidence of the social structure and spatial patterns of the modern city. However, the patterns identified appear to reflect a new level of complexity and required a combination of earlier models to effectively explain. In effect, the socio-spatial patterns are a hybrid of the old and the new. Thus, we can rightfully designate this city as postmodern.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban

Winstanley</field><field name="creator">Catriona Mills</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that examining the career of nineteenth-century actress and author Eliza Winstanley (1818-1882) increases understanding of the operation and reception of mid-Victorian penny weeklies. Winstanley&#8217;s works&#8212;drawing structurally and thematically on her lengthy stage career&#8212;show how a working woman constructed female ambition in a period when women were barred from many professions. Simultaneously, her uniquely visible career&#8212;when most authors who wrote exclusively for penny weeklies are obscure figures&#8212;makes her methodologically valuable, as a means of better understanding the editing processes and economies of penny weeklies. First, I outline the way in which Winstanley became involved with penny-weekly publishing, through an examination of her early correspondence with editor G. W. M. Reynolds, and examine the texts that show her emergence as an independent writer, developing concerns that stemmed from her own experience and professional life: her earliest actress-heroines grapple with commodified bodies and lives, with the difficulties of being a professional woman, with disrupted ambition. Second, I examine her role as editor of the short-lived Fiction for Family Reading, in which she develops complex notions of the way in which religion, gender, and socio-economic distinctions operate in mid-Victorian society, rewriting existing texts to remove God and foreground sexual threats and economic hardships. Running through this fiction is the idea that middle-class domesticity&#8212; superior to aristocratic decadence&#8212;is preferable to working-class life only in the absence of grinding, unremunerative work and the disruptions to comfort that this entails. Third, I outline the nature of Bow Bells, the journal for which Winstanley produced the majority of her confirmed fiction, showing how it constructed authorship, relied heavily on female writers, and recognised the significance of women readers. Winstanley&#8217;s fiction for this journal shows an experimental approach to genre and narrative, and an interest in successful and professional women. Finally, I look at adaptations of Winstanley&#8217;s serials for suburban theatres, demonstrating how the playwrights negotiated the inherent theatricality of her writing. These adaptations show a tension between broad changes to the narratives and a conflicting desire for verisimilitude, manifested in the way in which the playwrights structured their works around the serials&#8217; original illustrations. Eliza Winstanley&#8217;s career illuminates the intersection between forms of popular entertainment in the mid-Victorian period and the processes by which such material was produced.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:156728</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictors of Supervision Behaviours</field><field name="creator">Natasha Crow</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157733</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential of Leisure to Overcome Problems Faced by the Deinstitutionalisation of People with Intellectual Disabilities</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Fallu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157743</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intraspecific Somatic Hybridization of Mango (Mangifera indica L.)</field><field name="creator">Ramezan Rezazadeh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157751</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Availability of nitrogen in green cane trash blanketed soils in the wet tropics and its impact on productivity / profitability: a systems analysis</field><field name="creator">Mrs Elizabeth Meier</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157815</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age-related changes in sensori-motor function, postural stability, functional balance and mobility.</field><field name="creator">Low Choy, Nancy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158954</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-Entropy Method in Telecommunication Systems</field><field name="creator">Sho Nariai</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we look at how the Cross-Entropy (CE) method can be used to solve various optimisation and estimation problems in telecommunication systems and network planning, especially in the presence of noise. In Chapter 2, we mention what comprises optimisation problems. Various optimisation problems, such as constrained optimization and convex optimisation, are discussed. We also address noisy optimisation and how dealing effectively with noise plays a crucial role in locating a global optimal solution. A brief overview of three algorithms that have successfully been applied to noisy optimisation problems is also given. Chapter 3 explores a short overview of the methodology behind the CE method. We discuss how the CE method requires two simple iterative stages to locate an optimal "degenerate" sampling distribution, and hence an optimal solution to the optimisation problem. We also show how a simple modification of the algorithm can tackle noisy optimisation problems. Numerical experiments for solving both non-noisy and noisy multi-extremal continuous optimisation problems are conducted. Three test functions are used to investigate the performance of the CE algorithm on both non-noisy and noisy cases. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can locate a global optimal solution accurately. Also, we show that the performance of the CE algorithm can be improved using the injection method. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 discuss two types of the Network Planning Problem (NPP): single-type NPP and multi-type NPP. The aim is to determine which links in the system should be purchased in order to provide the highest possible service to the consumers, subject to a constraint on the total budget. We introduce various CE-based algorithms to tackle such non-linear combinatorial optimisation problem. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithms perform effectively and reliably in all test cases. Chapter 6 is concerned with estimating the blocking probabilities in circuit switched networks. We look at how Importance Sampling and Sequential Importance Sampling can be used to estimate the blocking probabilities. Here, the CE method is used to find optimal sampling parameters to be used in Importance Sampling and Sequential Importance Sampling. Numerical experiments suggest that Sequential Importance Sampling achieves a variance reduction over Importance Sampling in almost all cases at a cost of increased simulation time. Using CE further increases the efficiency of both.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158988</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Competitive Interactions in a Tropical Marine Epifaunal Community</field><field name="creator">Erin O'Leary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">interspecific competition, overgrowth, ascidians, sponges, bryozoans, One Tree Reef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159079</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Architectures for Bang-bang Phase Locked Loops</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Chan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159101</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost Accounting System Design: The Impact of Competition on Cost Allocation and Cost Management</field><field name="creator">Ms Sandra-lee Wallace</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Costing Systems, Cost Management, Cost Measurement, Contingency Theory,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159109</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Krylov and Finite State Projection methods for simulating stochastic biochemical kinetics via the Chemical Master Equation</field><field name="creator">Shevarl MacNamara</field><field name="description">Computational and mathematical models of cellular processes promise great benets in important elds such as molecular biology and medicine. Increasingly, researchers are incorporating the fundamentally discrete and stochastic nature of biochemical processes into the mathematical models that are intended to represent them. This has led to the formulation of models for genetic networks as continuous-time, discrete state, Markov processes, giving rise to the so-called Chemical Master Equation (CME), which is a discrete, partial dierential equation, that governs the evolution of the associated probability distribution function (PDF). While promising many insights, the CME is computationally challenging, especially as the dimension of the model grows. In this thesis, novel methods are developed for computing the PDF of the Master Equation. The problems associated with the high-dimensional nature of the Chemical Master Equation are addressed by adapting Krylov methods, in combination with Finite State Projection methods, to derive algorithms well-suited to the Master Equation. Variations of the approach that incorporate the Strang splitting and a stochastic analogue of the total quasi-steady-state approximation are also derived for chemical systems with disparate rates. Monte Carlo approaches, such as the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, that simulate trajectories of the process governed by the CME have been a very popular approach and we compare these with the PDF approaches developed in this thesis. The thesis concludes with a discussion of various implementation issues along with numerical results for important applications in systems biology, including the gene toggle, the Goldbeter-Koshland switch and the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Cascade.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Krylov Methods, Chemical Master

developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field

the Cypro-Archaic Period</field><field name="creator">Sandra Christou</field><field name="description">Although the earliest known literary evidence for a dual-sexed divinity on Cyprus dates to the fifth century BCE, archaeological evidence indicates there was a tradition on the island of sexually ambiguous imagery which predates the literary sources. This information prompted the present research, which traces the tradition back to the earliest known examples on Late Neolithic Cyprus, and tracks its evolution through to the Cypro-Archaic period. Rather than rely upon descriptions, photographs and drawings presented in consulted publications, the various international museums that house the figures were visited by the writer in order to physically examine the images. Controversial aspects of these figures were discussed with senior museum staff and/or curators. If figurines were unavailable for viewing, where possible, photographs were acquired from the relevant museums, and controversial aspects of the figures discussed by email. As a result, the majority of the images discussed in this thesis have been examined and photographed by the author. A catalogue of the sexually ambiguous imagery for Cyprus from the Neolithic to the Cypro-Archaic period has been compiled and is included in this work. It is proposed that the imagery is of Cypriot innovation, and consists of proto-anthropomorphic, anthropomorphic and half-animal, half-human representations. The genre is influenced from its earliest period by the figurative art of the Syro-Anatolian mainland, but from the Late Bronze Age onwards, influences from the western Mediterranean and Aegean are also evident. Despite the periods in which there is little evidence for figurine production, sexually ambivalent imagery re-emerges when figurative evidence is once more apparent in the archaeological records. Furthermore, stylistic continuity of the genre from one period to the next is also apparent. This continuity is regardless of the cultural changes which occur intermittently during the seven millennia period relevant to this study. Although it is not until the Cypro-Geometric period that there is firm evidence to support a religious interpretation of sexually equivocal imagery, it is suggested that the genre from the earliest period was at least associated with fertility, and perhaps religious cult.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cyprus, neolithic, bronze age, cypro-geometric, cypro-archaic, figurative art, androgyny, dualsexed, sexual ambiguity, ancient religion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160605</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Population Ecology of Manta Birostris in Southern Mozambique</field><field name="creator">Andrea Denise Marshall</field><field name="description">Despite being the world&#8217;s largest batoid fish, manta rays have been the focus of very little research in the last century. Almost nothing is currently known about their ecology or distribution throughout the world&#8217;s oceans. Manta rays are considered to be near-threatened to vulnerable by the World Conservation Union&#8217;s Redlist of endangered species, yet many populations still face threats from target fishing for their fin cartilage, branchial filaments and meat. The taxonomic history of the genus Manta has been questionable and convoluted,with Manta having one of the most extensive generic and species synonymies of any living genus of cartilaginous fish. Currently this genus is considered to be monotypicwith a single recognized species, Manta birostris. Behavioural and morphological data collected during this study showed that there are two distinct, sympatric species of manta ray in Mozambique. This discovery has led to an examination of manta ray distribution worldwide, with the two species hypothesis receiving further support from study sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This thesis examined large populations of both putative species in Mozambique. Development and application of a photographic-identification methodology allowed identification of individuals based on their unique ventral surface markings (spots). The ability to recognise individuals enabled many aspects of both populations to be examined. A total of 449 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant A and 101 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant B. Both populations exhibited a highly significant female bias in observed sex ratios of 1:3.5 and 1:7.4 respectively. The photographic identification approach was used in studies of population size and structure and to examine the reproductive ecology of these two distinct populations. Population estimates incorporating four years of re-sighting data on Manta birostris variant A and five years of data on Manta birostris variant B were conducted using the program MARK resulting in super population estimates of 890 and 600 individuals respectively. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for Manta birostris variant A based on observations of mating events and fresh pectoral fin tip scars on female rays produced when the male rays bite onto the fins during copulation. The distribution of scars was highly biased, with 99% on the left pectoral fin, indicative of a strong lateralised behavioural trait in this species. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralisation. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals giving birth in the summer after a gestation period of approximately one year. Reproductive periodicity in M. birostris variant A was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were seen to be pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed in fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Morphometric analysis of late-term foetus (M. birostris variant A) was contrasted with measurements taken from adult rays. These are the only detailed measurements on M. birostris variant A from the western Indian Ocean. Predatory scarring and bite injuries on individuals of both variant A and B were consistent with attacks from sharks of various sizes. The frequency and effect of these predatory injuries on the two populations were examined over a three-year period. Acoustic tags were attached to fourteen rays and their presence/absence at sites around the major inshore reefs was explored to evaluate how the rays utilised their environment on a temporal scale. Cleaning activity of both putative species of manta rays by small fishes occurred on these reefs and was considered to be the main reason why the rays were present at these sites. Parasite removal and wound healing were implicated as the benefits received. Host cleaner fish species partition the manta ray body to avoid interspecific competition while the two putative species appear to partition cleaning habitats, with very little overlap apparent. This research on manta rays is the first of its kind in African waters. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this genus. The study additionally provided sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the separation of these two putative species of Manta and a full revision of the genus with the systematic examination of specimens throughout Manta&#8217;s range. The results of this study may be useful in this endeavour as diagnostic characteristics have been isolated that may help to differentiate members of this genus. The results of this research study are directly applicable to management strategies for both putative species of manta rays off the East Coast of Africa as well as populations worldwide and have highlighted the potential need for different conservation strategies</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elasmobranch, Manta ray, Population biology, Taxonomy, Morphology, Reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160974</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous Narratives of Success: Exploring Conversation Groups as Research Methodology with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Students at The University of Queensland</field><field name="creator">Mrs Janice Stewart</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs and verifies a methodological practice of conversation groups and grounded theory for examining and changing the dominant discourse that situates Indigenous Australian tertiary students in mainstream education. Within this research, not only was a rich shared discourse development on a conceptual level valuable and necessary in the telling of our stories but it offered us as co-researchers&#8212;Indigenous students and a non-Indigenous researcher&#8212;a means of revealing and working through understandings and mis-understandings. Using such a methodological approach also suggested future possibilities for effective Indigenous/non-Indigenous stakeholders&#8217; working relationships in research, and possibly policy-making in Australian institutions generally. As a methodological and communicative tool for opening up a dialogic space, the use of conversation groups for developing effective communicative relationships held promise for highlighting the experiences of Indigenous students who themselves, then negotiated the position for theoretically and pragmatically directing individual and collective decisions and actions. Inviting Indigenous students into this space provided an environment for the development of an Indigenous standpoint, which is not merely an Indigenous opinion but requires an engagement with the questions and issues affecting Indigenous students as interdependent individuals. Such a standpoint does not happen automatically and needs opportunities to grow and mature. I found that conversation groups involving the Indigenous students and me working together as co-researchers provided this opportunity. With Indigenous students&#8217; narratives of success chosen as the research topic, productively communicating views became a verification of the research methodology used and an enactment of their right to be heard, both highlighting voice and representation issues. The research methodology we used and the ensuing discourse development became an entwined interplay, where each served to reinforce the other. The Indigenous students and I were practising the research approach of conversation groups while developing a conceptualised discourse on being successful. This transdisciplinary approach in co-research, encompassing Indigenous and Western research approaches, allowed for experiential and theoretical engagement with questions of cultural authority, representation, power and agency by Indigenous students and me as a non-Indigenous researcher. Central to the Indigenous students&#8217; stories were notions of &#8220;place&#8221; as created, negotiated and manipulated by successful Indigenous students as they move between and within fluid subjectivities or stances in relationships, time and space. A broader view was taken of how intersections, layers and parallels are negotiated by the Indigenous students within and between multitudes of places in the blurring of living in two worlds: Black and White.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous tertiary students</field><field name="subject">narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">conversation groups</field><field name="subject">success</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161712</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agitators and Patriots: Cultural and Political Identity in Queensland's Spanish Communities, 1900-1975</field><field name="creator">Robert Mason</field><field name="description">Abstract In 1900 there were fewer than a dozen Spaniards in Queensland, most of whom were transient labourers from Victoria. By 1975 there were several thousand Spaniards, of which the majority had travelled directly to Queensland to settle permanently. The thesis uses a chronological structure to trace the development of Spanish political and cultural identities in Queensland over the seventy-five year period. Early settlers were strongly influenced by radical anarchism, and were engaged in ideological debates and Queensland industrial disputes that referenced patterns of behaviour throughout the Hispanic world. Later settlers were predominantly Basques, and used political associations and cultural events to project their identity and to engage with Queensland society. Queensland&#8217;s Spanish communities were never defined simply in terms of ethnicity, nationality or political persuasion. Their cultural and political identity was the product of dynamic interactions between social narratives and transnational and local spaces. Spanish identities were the result of an ongoing and complex dialogue between experiences in Spain and Queensland, which channelled migrants&#8217; memories and expectations. Spaniards were deeply involved in Queensland politics for the entire period of their settlement. Their engagement involved the application and modification of Spanish models of political and cultural action to the Queensland environment. Memories and behaviours were re-articulated through a dialogue that referenced events in Queensland and Spain, and debated their future implications to the local communities. The thesis does not try to separate migrants&#8217; political and cultural identity. Cultural norms enacted in Queensland provided models to achieve both political and social goals in Australia and Spain. Later migrants used ethnic networks to assert their cultural difference, in processes that often had clear political implications. Queenslanders were tolerant of what were seen as folk cultures, and were rarely attuned to the political discussions that underpinned regional ethnicities. Yet, within the Spanish communities, tensions regarding the valid parameters for regional cultural expression were often foils for broader political debates. Queensland Spaniards&#8217; self-perception, and their negotiation of multiple identities, continued to reference the spaces and imagery of Spain. Yet, these identities were subjective, and the move to Queensland altered their purpose and modes of expression. Queensland Spaniards sought to recreate comparable social networks to those that had sustained their identities prior to emigration, frequently contacting comparable Australian groups that shared similar means of expression. Spaniards did not set old identities aside, but new issues in Spain and Queensland forced a process of clarification and the compartmentalisation of roles. Sharp divisions in Spanish communities&#8217; social memories were accentuated by the regional nature of Queensland settlement, focussing cultural debates on regional norms. The regional nature of Queensland&#8217;s Spanish settlement altered the expression of cultural and political identities, but also left them relatively uncontested until the influx of Castilian migrants in the late 1950s. Most Spanish migrants to Australia preferred the southern states of Victoria and New South Wales, where greater stability fostered larger and more cohesively &#8216;Spanish&#8217; communities. Queensland&#8217;s long distances and radical political atmosphere instead facilitated the replication of Spain&#8217;s regional characteristics. Industrial tensions aided radicals who were able to find comparable political identities, whilst family networks that referred to spaces in Spain developed sophisticated strategies to accelerate chain migration. The thesis corrects a serious lack of research into Spanish migrants in Australia. The group&#8217;s small size has led researchers to favour larger communities, despite the important information offered by the Spanish example. The thesis provides a historical narrative of Spaniards&#8217; experiences in Queensland, but also applies academic debates regarding social memories, and investigates their relationship to cultural and political identities. This includes not only the maintenance of social memories, but also their replication and modification over several generations. The analysis uses awareness of political change in both Queensland and Spain, to investigate migrants&#8217; long-term response to political trauma and changed social circumstance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Hispanic Studies</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Spain</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162229</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amino Acid Digestibility and Requirements of Broiler Chickens</field><field name="creator">Mulyantini Ni Gusti Ayu</field><field name="description">The dietary requirement for protein is actually a requirement for the amino acids contained in the dietary protein. The efficiency of protein utilization depends to a large extent on the amino acid composition of the diet. Although a large volume of published amino acid digestibility values for poultry feedstuffs is available, there are still many gaps in our knowledge on digestibility and utilization of amino acids. The major focus of this thesis was to examine several aspects of amino acid digestibility and utilization in broiler chickens. Initial studies examined the performance of two commercial broiler strains fed diets formulated on total or digestible amino acids. The objective of this study was to determine the individual bird response to 4 different diets formulated on: 1) total amino acids; 2) digestible amino acids (book values)using the same ingredient as diet 1; 3) digestible amino acids values determined on the same ingredients as used in diet 1: and 4) digestible amino acids but formulated commercially. The results show that birds given diets formulated on digestible amino acid basis, grew faster, ate more feed and converted it into body weight more efficiently, and had a higher proportion of body protein (P&lt;0.05) than birds given diet formulated on a total amino acid basis. It was also shown that males broiler were significantly faster growing, consumed more feed and had better feed efficiency than do female broilers. There was also a significant (P&lt;0.05)sex x diet interaction for weight gain. Whilst, males always grew faster than females, the difference was much greater for those given the digestible amino acid formulated diets. The studies reported in Chapters 5 and 6 was conducted to determine the digestible methionine, lysine and threonine requirement of broilers during the starter and finisher periods. The minimum digestible methionine requirements to maximize weight gain for starter was similar with grower. Digestible lysine requirements to maximize weight gain represent a decrease 25%, respectively from starter to grower. The lysine digestible requirement for weight gain decreased from 11.4 g/kg diet (0 to 3 wk) to 8.5 g/kg diet (3 to 6 wk). For threonine, the starter threonine level of 6.5 g/kg resulted in the best responses (P&lt;0.01). The study reported in Chapter 7 was to identify the extent of differences in the nutritional value of sorghum available within Australia, in particular the apparent digestibility of amino acids in sorghum samples based upon digesta samples taken from the lower ileum of the chicken. The results of this study suggest that it is possible to estimate digestible amino acid supply from sorghum from the protein content of the grain. Crude protein content (N x 6.25) of sorghum varied from 80.2 to 117.5 g/kg dry matter. In most Australian cereal based diet lysine is first limiting amino acids. In this experimental diet, methionine is the first limiting amino acid content ranged from 1.06 to 1.42%. It followed by lysine, histidine and glycine, respectively. The cereal-based diets fed to poultry contain substantial quantities of phytin,which is poorly digested by poultry. The poor digestive utilization of phytin-bound P by poultry and its consequences on digestibility of protein and amino acids lead to do some more extensive research in this aspect. In this regard, the effects of enzyme supplementation on apparent ileal amino acid digestibility of cereal were studied in Chapter 8. Supplementing wheat fed to 5-wk-old broilers with xylanase alone or a combination of xylanase and phytase improved the ileal digestibility of amino acids. Although there was improvement in sorghum based diet, phytase and xylanase supplementation had no effect on the avaergae of ileal amino acid digestibility. Overall, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that formulation of poultry diets on a digestible amino acid basis is superior to formulation of diets on a total amino acid basis. This study suggested that genotype and sex differences in performance and body composition should be taken into account when formulating diets to maximize performance of broiler chickens. Moreover, the requirement of digestible lysine, methionine and threonine for broiler chicken during the starter and finisher periods were obtained in this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162399</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criminal Nation: The Crime Fiction of Mary Helena Fortune</field><field name="creator">Miss Nicola Bowes</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the crime fiction of Mary Helena Fortune (c.18331910). My analysis concentrates on Fortune&#8217;s series, &#8220;The Detective&#8217;s Album&#8221;, more than four hundred self-contained crime stories published over forty years that are framed as the &#8220;casebook&#8221; of a colonial detective, Mark Sinclair. Although this series remains nominally the reminiscences of Sinclair, the stories within the casebook increasingly employ private and amateur detectives, and Sinclair himself transforms from a member of the colonial police force into a private inquiry agent. I characterise this move as constituting a shift from Fortune&#8217;s detecting heroes acting essentially as &#8220;public avengers&#8221; to becoming instead predominantly &#8220;private defenders&#8221;. Accompanying the evolution of the detective are other structural changes in Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction, so that by the 1880s an increasingly private model of detective was more often resolving a domestic mystery in a suburban setting than investigating a violent crime on the mean streets. The central aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the ways in which these transformations relate to the differentiated social and historical conditions within colonial Australia. Through the close analysis of Fortune&#8217;s crime texts and examination of the cultural and historical context in which they were produced, the thesis offers perspectives on broad cultural patterns. This thesis draws predominantly on a lineage of critics who have analysed crime fiction using Marxist, Foucauldian and Postcolonialist strategies. I utilise in particular the central paradigm of D. A. Miller&#8217;s The Novel and the Police (1988): &#8211; his assertion that in the nineteenth-century novel the &#8220;move to discard the role of the detective is at the same time a move to disperse the function of detection&#8221;. The appearance of private and amateur detectives in Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction indicates respectively the professionalisation and privatisation of the mechanism of detection, evolutions that reflect a broad embourgeoisment within her crime corpus. Such a social transformation of nineteenth-century crime fiction occurred across the industrialised world. In British crime fiction, for instance, the ordinary workaday policeman of the 1850s had given way by the 1890s to such independent and professional detectives as Sherlock Holmes. But while the embourgeoisment of crime fiction was an international phenomenon, I argue that in Australian crime fiction the emergence of private and surrogate detectives also performed a second, crucial function: to distance the agent of detection, and demotic crime fiction itself, from the enforcement of imperial order in the colonial landscape. The movement from simple criminal apprehensions to financial and reputation protection also increasingly distances Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction from the kind of direct social control necessary to enforce imperial order. v This thesis contains four analytical chapters, each of which is devoted to exploring mechanisms by which Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction dispersed the function of detection and concealed the conservative disciplinary order that underpins the fiction. The first three chapters examine familiar forms of fictional detectives: the official police detective; the private and the amateur detective; and the female detective, both official and unofficial. The final analytical chapter examines the way in which the criminal also worked as part of the dispersed function of detection. One of the key ways in which Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction works to reinforce disciplinary order is, paradoxically, to make the detectives often fail to solve the crime, so that order is restored only by the collective efforts of several individuals or through the mechanism of fate or an avenging land, or even as a consequence of the criminals&#8217; own actions. Thus Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction is not a celebration of virtuoso individualism, as is found in the stories of Sherlock Holmes, but instead of an ethically logical and just world in which order is the product of collective efforts on the part of a largely cohesive community, and in which the apprehension of criminals and restoration of order are presented as inevitable outcomes. Stephen Knight has described Fortune as &#8220;internationally the most significant woman writing about crime in the mid-nineteenth century&#8221; (Continent of Mystery 4), and yet her impressive corpus of crime fiction has never received extended scholarly attention. This thesis addresses this omission, but more importantly, the conclusions I offer about Mary Fortune&#8217;s crime fiction contribute to an understanding of a much larger question about how Australians began to imagine and adopt a national identity in the nineteenth century. It is certainly clear from Fortune&#8217;s crime corpus that well before the nationalist-democratic cultural insurrection of the 1890s, Australian fiction already offered versions of the key paradigms that still inflect the national imagination into the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">mary fortune,</field><field name="subject">crime fiction,</field><field name="subject">australian literature</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">nationalism</field><field name="subject">detective fiction</field><field name="subject">female detective</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">bushranger</field><field name="subject">postcolonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162386</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins of Left Behind Eschatology</field><field name="creator">Mr David Bennett</field><field name="description">"The Origins of Left Behind Eschatology&#8221; examines the origins of the beliefs that undergird the popular Left Behind novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. How that system of belief arose has long been hotly debated. Using mainly non-fiction books and articles by authors with Left Behind views, I first seek to determine what those beliefs are. From that I draw out eight specific beliefs that are essential to Left Behind eschatology. I next conduct an examination of eschatology in certain eras of Church history, looking for the origins of each of these eight test criteria and seeking when they all first came together to form a system. I examine the early Church thoroughly, but briefly, noting that five of the test criteria were present in the first three hundred years of Christian history. However, no individual taught more than four of them. In addition, the four scholars in this period who each taught four of these beliefs also taught doctrines contrary to Left Behind. I then look at the period from the Reformation, with particular emphasis on the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. While teachings similar to two of the three remaining Left Behind concepts are found in the seventeenth century those two ideas do not properly emerge until the eighteenth century in a work by Morgan Edwards, a Welsh/American Baptist. The final criterion does not appear until the late 1820s in the thought of J.N. Darby of the Plymouth Brethren. Darby was also the first to draw all eight elements together in the early 1830s.

The essential context for such a study is twofold. First, within the Australian Church there is clearly a dominant emphasis on an anthropocentric mission strategy, and consequently it will be argued that such a position is inadequate. Second, it will be argued that it can almost be taken as a &#8220;given&#8221; that the ecological or environmental crisis facing life on planet Earth is immediate and critical, and covers a range of well-documented categories &#8211; global warming, extreme weather events, degradation of the soil, and other factors. The loss of bio-diversity is gathering pace, while the threat to iconic features such as the Great Barrier Reef is very real. Even just from a pragmatic or humanitarian point of view, it seems important for the Christian Church to be part of a global response. From that background the thesis proceeds in three essential stages. The first issue is the identification of a sound ecological theology, or ecotheology. From the background of a large and increasing volume of literature, a range of both human-centred and eco-friendly theological positions is considered, concluding with an argument in favour of theistic biocentrism, but acknowledging that a responsible Christian environmental response may emerge from other theological positions. Thus, the thesis proposes that in addition to the scientific evidence, there is a compelling theological argument for Christian action in caring for the environment as God&#8217;s creation, and this represents a clear rationale for eco-mission. In the second part, the issue that is considered is the range of existing theologies of mission. This literature has tended to be strongly anthropocentric and very weak in the ecological area; however, there is an increasing volume of literature demonstrating a shift in emphasis towards an enhanced awareness of an ecological dimension, and in identifying that trend the thesis seeks to develop an eco-mission theology. However, there is still a perception in many congregations and denominations that ecology is not really part of the Church&#8217;s agenda. While practical action guidance models are not common, this thesis aims to challenge such a perception, and to change the culture of apathy and non-involvement in building on a foundation of ecotheology and a theology of eco-mission. Third, the thesis then explores the range and extent of Christian eco-mission, beginning with a study of how that is practised in England, and continuing with a comparative study of emerging eco-mission activity in Australia. Thus, it addresses the fundamental question as to why Christian denominations (and, by implication, local congregations) are not more actively involved in ecological mission, and explore possibilities for that position to be changed. The thesis is set within a practical theology paradigm, and employs a qualitative methodology. This involves a series of interviews supplemented by written comments and personal observations, from which dominant themes will be drawn and analysed. Thus the thesis is designed to help the Christian community to understand the seriousness of the situation as well as the biblical and theological rationale for appropriate action in &#8220;the greening of mission&#8221; and the establishment of an Australian eco-church model. In grasping the ecological aspects of its divine charter in caring for God&#8217;s creation, the Church may operate with greater confidence alongside other concerned people and groups in the community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="subject">Ecotheology; eco-mission; ecology; environment; biocentrism, anthropocentrism; theocentrism; stewardship</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:163691</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourses in Values Education: A fractured fairytale</field><field name="creator">Dana Anders</field><field name="description">Abstract Ongoing tension surrounding values education in both the wider community and among politicians and academics, as well as the plethora of values education programs on the commercial market, all contribute to a number of competing values education discourses that can make it difficult for individual classroom teachers to make choices regarding what and how to teach values. The aim of the current study was to contribute to an understanding of discourses of values education in Australia and investigate the way in which the Discourse models of government policy documents and classroom teacher Discourse models of values education intersect in terms of both alignment and fragmentation. In addressing the problem of how teachers choose to bring clarity to competing values education discourses, this research comprises two parts. The first part is an analysis of a key policy text, the National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools (2005). The second part focuses on fourteen interviews with seven primary school classroom teachers conducted at different times during one school term. Each teacher was interviewed twice. The interviews were treated as objects of analysis and not just as an information source. The informal theories that underpin the policy and interview texts are analysed through James Paul Gee&#8217;s (2005) lens of &#8220;Discourse models&#8221;. This is a critical discourse approach to analysing a social phenomenon, with analytic focus placed on the language in the texts, as well as the localised and broader social context in which the language is situated. The way in which the policy and interview texts functioned strategically was analysed. The Discourse models evident in the texts were then identified through the use of &#8216;storylines&#8217; as an analytic tool. In identifying Discourse models, insight was gained into how the official policy and the teacher participants in the study conceptualised values education. Analysis of the policy document showed how the text acted strategically to build legitimacy and the appearance of consensus surrounding the approach to values education advocated in the document. The storyline that emerged was one of the Australian Federal Government as a &#8216;hero&#8217; intervening in values education to save young people who are at moral risk in the 21st century. Analysis of the interview transcripts showed how these texts also acted strategically to build legitimacy and the appearance that each participant&#8217;s approach to values education was right, normal and needed. A similar storyline emerged in the interview texts, where young people were in need of rescuing due to the moral peril of current times but it was the teacher participants who were now in the role of &#8216;hero&#8217;. The teacher participants in the study showed that they called upon a multiplicity of social roles, everything they were as moral beings, in their efforts to rescue students. The results indicate that there is both alignment and fragmentation in the Discourse models identified in both the policy and interview texts. Values education was conceived of in largely behavioural terms, where values were fixed, and change towards these value norms was focused on the individual behaviour of the student. Alignment centred on a dominant &#8216;salvation&#8217; story in the texts that regarded values education as a way to rescue students from moral peril. This master model of the salvation story was fractured, however, by the experiences of the classroom teachers in the study. Most poignant was that not all students were able to be rescued despite the best of professed intentions. There are several implications emerging from these findings. First, the explicit move towards fixed values norms has exclusionary effects. Second, the focus on changing the behaviour of students as individuals ignores systemic levels of oppression. Third, and overall, the didactic teaching of values creates tensions over the perceived interference of the state in the lives of young people. Recommendations emerging from the study include that teachers be given increased opportunities to become more aware of their own values systems, the impact of these in the classroom; and develop their understanding of the broader social structures in which values education in classrooms is situated. This awareness is a necessary complement to the official discourses of values education in Australia in order to mitigate the potential exclusionary effects of policy. 130105 Primary Education 35%, 160506 Education policy 35%, 1399 Other Education 30%</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Values Education</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:164956</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and Functional Analysis of Osteal Macrophages: Resident Tissue Macrophages are Intercalated throughout Mouse Bone Lining Tissues and Regulate Osteoblast Function In Vitro</field><field name="creator">Ming-Kang Chang</field><field name="description">Resident tissue macrophages are an integral component of many tissues and are important in development, homeostasis and repair. Macrophages are present at sites of both pathologic bone deposition and loss, and can produce osteo-active factors. These observations link macrophages to bone disease, however their contribution to bone dynamics is poorly understood. The molecular and cellular mechanisms driving osteoblast differentiation, matrix deposition and mineralization in vivo are incompletely understood and this deficiency is translated to limited ability to clinically manipulate bone formation. The emerging understanding of the bi-directional interactions between the osseus and immune systems (osteoimmunology) provides a novel avenue to identify mechanisms involved in the regulation of bone formation. In this study, the presence and distribution of macrophages on bone surfaces was systematically analysed and their functional contribution to the bone microenvironment was investigated. Using immunohistochemistry a discrete population of mature resident tissue macrophages was demonstrated throughout resting murine osteal tissues, termed OsteoMacs. Utilising MacGreen mice (csf1r promoter drives eGFP transgene expression in macrophages and other myeloid cells), it was demonstrated that OsteoMacs were intercalated amongst other bone lining cells in both the endosteum and periosteum. OsteoMacs were TRAPneg in situ and had limited osteoclastogenic ability in vitro therefore they are unlikely to serve as the immediate physiologic osteoclast precursors in vivo. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that macrophage gene expression was regulated in response to a characteristic feature of the bone microenvironment, elevated extracellular calcium. Quantitative PCR validated upregulation of sphingosine kinase 1, interleukin 1 receptor antagonise, progressive ankylosis, vascular endothelial growth factor c and dipepetidase 2 mRNA in response to elevated extracellular calcium, suggesting the potential roles of these genes in this unique niche. GNF Symatlas microarray and quantitative PCR demonstrated the expression of macrophage-restricted genes throughout a 21-day primary osteoblast differentiation time course, suggesting co-isolation of OsteoMacs with primary osteoblasts. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that over all 15.9% of the digested primary calvarial cell preparations were OsteoMacs. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that OsteoMacs persisted and expanded in standard 21-day osteoblast differentiation assays. Contrary to previous studies, we demonstrated it was the OsteoMacs, and not osteoblasts, within calvarial preparations that selectively detected patho-physiological concentrations of the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A protocol was developed to deplete OsteoMacs from calvarial digests to determine if their presence within these cultures facilitates osteoblast differentiation or function. OsteoMac removal did not affect expression of the early osteoblast differentiation marker genes collagen type I or alkaline phosphatase. However, OsteoMac removal significantly decreased gene expression of the osteoblast mineralisation marker osteocalcin and mineralisation function, assessed by von Kossa staining. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrated that osteoblast enrichment had a broad impact on transcription within the culture, identifying both candidate OsteoMac marker genes as well as osteoblast expressed genes that are regulated by OsteoMacs. Potential OsteoMac-enriched candidate genes insulin-like growth factor a, dipepetidase 2, glycoprotein NMB, and macrophage expressed gene 1 as well as osteoblast-specific genes bone sialoprotein and thrombospondin 1 were selected based on their potential involvement in osteoblast function. In a transwell co-culture system of enriched osteoblasts and macrophages, it was demonstrated that macrophages were required for osteoblast mineralisation in response to the physiologic remodelling stimulus, elevated extracellular calcium. A blocking soluble receptor strategy provided evidence that this is mediated in a BMP-2 and -4 independent manner. To investigate the relevance of OsteoMacs to bone formation in vivo, immunohistochemistry staining for the mature tissue macrophage marker F4/80 was performed in long bone sections from rapidly growing mice. OsteoMacs were closely associated with areas of bone formation in situ, forming a distinctive canopy structure over mature cuboidal osteoblasts (collagen type I+, osteocalcin+) on endosteal cortical surfaces. Using adapted histomorphometic analysis, we determined that 77 &#177; 2.1% (n = 7) of the endosteal mature osteoblast surface was covered by the F4/80+ OsteoMac canopy. This observation suggested that OsteoMacs are optimally located to regulate osteoblast function in vivo. In summary, we have demonstrated that OsteoMacs are an integral component of bone lining tissues and play a novel role in bone dynamics through regulating osteoblast function. These observations implicate OsteoMacs, in addition to osteoclasts and osteoblasts, as principal participants in bone dynamics. Further delineation of OsteoMac functions is likely to provide new avenues for treating bone disease and assisting bone repair.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macrophage</field><field name="subject">osteoblast</field><field name="subject">bone</field><field name="subject">osteoclast</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">osteoimmunology</field><field name="subject">bone formation</field><field name="subject">osteomac</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165763</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adults&#8217; Physically-Active Transport: A Population- and Destination-Based Perspective</field><field name="creator">Rachel Cole</field><field name="description">Increasing population levels of physical activity is a key public health priority in combating chronic non-communicable diseases. Epidemiological evidence for the health benefits of moderate-intensity physical activity has aroused interest in active transport, particularly walking. Social ecological models, and specifically policy and environmental approaches to increasing active transport are core elements of public health goals. There is currently limited walking for transport data in Australia that can be analysed using public health criteria. There is some evidence that socio-demographic differentials may exist. Investigations of the correlates of walking for transport suggest that residents of neighbourhoods with greater population densities, more land use mix, greater street connectivity and better walking and cycling infrastructure, tend to walk and cycle more. The studies in this Thesis start to address some aspects of these knowledge gaps by focussing on the social, personal and environmental correlates of adults&#8217; walking for transport. These studies aim to identify how active commuting and transport options might potentially be used to increase adult levels of health-enhancing physical activity, through increased walking. In doing so, it assists in increasing understanding about ways to link public health policy initiatives more strongly to the transport and urban-design fields, and to other sectors with an interest in active transport. The thesis begins with a literature review of the descriptive epidemiology and correlates of walking for transport. Chapter 2 is a secondary analysis of existing data from a statewide survey of adults. It reports socio-demographic variations in moderate to brisk paced walking for transport, and the contribution of walking for transport to health-enhancing physical activity, separately from walking for recreation. The results showed that rates of sufficient walking for transport using public health criteria (10% for men; 9% for women) were slightly less than those for walking for recreation or exercise (14% for both men and women). Few socio-demographic differences emerged in rates of walking for transport. Men aged over 60 years were significantly less likely to walk for transport. Walking contributed more toward meeting the current public-health guidelines among women (15% to 21%) than among men (6% to 8%). The Thesis then examines relevant issues associated with walking to two discrete destinations, within a defined local-community context. The first destination-type was primary schools (Chapter 3). In this study, the prevalence and duration of walking to and from school, together with perceived influences on doing so, were examined among parents of primary school children. Findings showed that, despite the overall low prevalence of walking to school by parents, health-enhancing benefits may be achieved, even when other modes of transport are used in conjunction with walking. Walking was a common (28%) mode of transport for journeys less than two kilometres. Eighteen percent of parents who travelled by modes other than walking also walked for at least 10 minutes. Significantly greater proportions of parents who walked for at least 10 minutes: had only one car in their household; had a child who attended a government school; did not have a driver&#8217;s licence; had 10 years or less of education; and, lived within two kilometres of the school. Factors perceived by parents as influencing walking to and from school were: being physically active; safety concerns for the child walking alone; not having to park; walking being the child&#8217;s preferred option; there being too much motor vehicle traffic; and, their child&#8217;s age and road sense. The second destination-type examined was tertiary education institutions (Chapter 4). In this study, associations of stages of motivational readiness for active transport with perceived barriers and incentives to walking to and from university among students were examined. Common barriers to walking were long travel distances, inconvenience and time constraints. Common incentives were shorter travel distance, having more time, supportive infrastructure and better security. Those not considering active commuting (pre-contemplators) were significantly more likely to report shorter travel distance as an incentive compared to those in the contemplation-preparation stage. Those in the contemplation-preparation stage were significantly more likely to report lack of motivation, inadequate infrastructure, shorter travel distance and inconvenience as barriers; and, having more time, supportive infrastructure, social support and incentive programs as enablers. Chapter 5 explores ways of linking public health policy initiatives with other sectors. Structured interviews with senior and middle level administrators from public, private and community groups were used to assess perceived barriers and enablers to active transport. Key themes emerged from the study relating to infrastructure delivery, public transport services, walk- and cycle-friendly community attributes, political leadership and government coordination, and societal travel norms and culture. There were also themes relating to limited resources and limited relevant technical expertise, institutional and practitioner cultures, and agencies not identifying with their roles in active transport. Broader intersectoral policies and cross-government initiatives were seen to hold promise, including economic incentives and built environment guidelines, campaigns targeting public attitudes and opinions, and community participation in policy-making. The findings from these studies and the implications for increasing physical activity through walking for transport are discussed in Chapter 6. These findings have potential to be used to inform intervention approaches, study initiatives and future research directions across key sectors for specific subgroups and particular destinations.

The divine couple R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the object of devotion of the greater Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava bhakti tradition has been the focus of several academic studies. Almost all scholarly publications and literature relating to the religious tradition of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a tend to focus on R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the divine couple. In contrast, very little is published on Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a divine couple. My doctoral research examines the almost 700-year old Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition that is still very much alive today and that continues to thrive in the state of Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra in India. The research has focused on centrality of Goddess Rukmi&#7751;&#299; in the tradition and its doctrine as revealed from the Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; devotional literature written by its poet-sants. I also study the devotional practices and profile of contemporary Ru-K tradition followers to establish how their understanding of the doctrine influences and shapes their personal practices. In particular, I explore the hypothesis that the Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition is a distinctive, syncretistic, and living devotional tradition that integrates Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and &#346;aiva elements in its Marathi poet-sant literature as well as in its religious practice amongst its followers. Thus, in both theory and practice, the tradition caters to the needs and dispositions of followers from various social classes. My research methodology mainly comprised textual analysis Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; devotional literature written by the four major poet-sants of the Ru-K bhakti tradition. The research also involved a small component of field trip to study the contemporary followers and practices of the tradition. Research revealed that the followers of Rukmi&#7751;i-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition look upon Rukmi&#7751;&#299; as pure devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The analysis of the hagiographies and local legends reveal Rukmi&#7751;&#299;&#8217;s role as a mediator and facilitator of meetings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with those who love him and are devoted to him. Acting as a mediator between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and his common devotees, she brought him out of his royal pastimes of Dv&#257;rak&#257; to Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura, albeit on the pretext of getting upset with him. Following K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#8217;s appearance in Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura, it has become the centre and springboard of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition. The Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a primarily involve personal loving exchanges between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (as Vi&#7789;&#7789;hala) and his devotees from all walks of life. In these pastimes, Rukmi&#7751;&#299; plays the compassionate mediator between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and his devotees, facilitating their meetings and exchanges. Therefore, Rukmi&#7751;&#299; is also looked upon by devotees as a kind and considerate mother. Analysis of the sant literature of the tradition revealed the dichotomous doctrinal stance of Advaitic (non dualistic) nirgu&#7751;a bhakti towards an impersonal Supreme taken by J&#241;&#257;ne&#347;vara and Ekan&#257;tha, and that of Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava (dualistic) sagu&#7751;a bhakti towards a personalised form of Supreme, taken by N&#257;madeva and Tuk&#257;r&#257;ma, co-existing under the umbrella of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition. The reason for such a harmonious co-existence of mutually incompatible doctrines and flourishing of the tradition despite the incongruity is owing to the two common practices, singing the glories of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and worshipping of personal form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, both of which are considered to be of significance by both doctrines, albeit for different reasons and to achieve dissimilar objectives. Both practices have been instrumental in bringing together the followers and devotees with contrasting and incompatible doctrinal leanings. The case study of the contemporary devotees revealed a dichotomy, in the form of two different classes of devotees found within the tradition, one consisting of the non-elite rank and file devotees from rural and semi-urban regions displaying sagu&#7751;a bhakti practices and understanding, and the other consisting of devotees from the elite class taking an Advaitic nirgu&#7751;a stance. These classes continue to be maintained because the preachers, although Advaitic in their personal stance, tend to preach sagu&#7751;a bhakti to the masses, considering them to be insufficiently qualified for the advanced stage of Advaita. Consequently, the dichotomy perpetuates itself and is apparently harmonized through this bivalence on the part of preachers and common devotees. The unique aspect involving the fusion of &#346;aivism and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism that one finds in the form of Hari-hara-aikya-bhava, sets the Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition distinctly apart from the greater Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava tradition, where such a fusion is not just absent, but rather clearly and consciously avoided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rukmini-krishna, vitthala, rukmini, marathi vaishnavism, varakari, panduranga, saguna bhakti, nirguna bhakti, marathi poet-sant, pandharpur.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167636</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proenvironmental Behaviour in Organisations: The Role of Emotion and Issue Ownership</field><field name="creator">Sally Russell</field><field name="description">It is now clear that managers, and their organisations, are under increasing pressure to respond to environmental issues (IPCC, 2007; KPMG, 2005). Research has identified the important role that individuals play in affecting organisational change (Andersson &amp; Bateman, 2000; Bansal, 2003; Starik, 1995), yet more remains to be done. Despite past success of cognitive and behavioural perspectives in explaining proenvironmental behaviours, few researchers have explored its affective dimensions (Kals &amp; Maes, 2002; Vining &amp; Ebreo, 2002). While organisations and the natural environment (ONE) research does mention emotive components of proenvironmental behaviours (Andersson &amp; Bateman, 2000; Bansal &amp; Roth, 2000; Ramus &amp; Steger, 2000), there are very few studies that examine emotion directly. The lack of affective research on environmental issues in organisations has meant that ONE research has not kept pace with the theoretical and empirical developments in wider management literature that clearly demonstrate that emotion is an inescapable part of work-life (Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1995; Fineman, 2003; H&#228;rtel, Zerbe, &amp; Ashkanasy, 2005). As such, therefore, more research is needed to examine further the role of emotion in driving proenvironmental behaviours (Kals &amp; Maes, 2002; Vining &amp; Ebreo, 2002). Within this research, I aim to address this need by developing an understanding of the contribution of emotion to workplace proenvironmental behaviours. I draw on Weiss and Cropanzano&#8217;s (1996) Affective Events Theory and Pratt and Dutton&#8217;s (2000) theory of issue ownership to assimilate current understanding of the role of emotion in proenvironmental behaviour, from the fields of environmental psychology, ONE, and emotions in organisations. I also integrate Stern&#8217;s (2000) Value-Belief-Norm theory in order to account for both attitudinal and affective antecedents of proenvironmental behaviour. The relationships between environmental issues, emotions, and proenvironmental behaviour were explored in Study 1. Thematic analysis and content analysis of 31 interview transcripts revealed that managers experience positive and negative emotional responses to environmental issues. Results showed that emotions were expressed significantly more often when managers discussed environmental issues and proenvironmental behaviours at the individual level, compared to the organisational level. These findings demonstrate the importance of the organisational context in exploring the antecedents of workplace proenvironmental behaviour. In Study 2, my aim was to test a conceptual model of affective and attitudinal components of workplace proenvironmental behaviour. The sample for the study was 324 employees from five Australian organisations. I developed a web-survey to collect data from the employees and used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the data. Results showed that aggregated positive emotions enhanced workplace proenvironmental behaviours. Contrary to expectations, however, I found that aggregated negative emotion impeded proenvironmental behaviour. Furthermore, results suggested that the direct relationships between emotion and behaviour were more important than the mediated effect of issue ownership. I conducted two experiments to test further the direct effects of emotion on workplace proenvironmental behaviour and issue ownership. In Study 3, I conducted a laboratory experiment. Five discrete emotions were manipulated using audio-visual stimuli developed for the purposes of the research. One hundred and ninety-four masters and final year undergraduate students participated in the study. Results demonstrated that emotions of the same valence led to different effects on workplace proenvironmental behaviour intentions and recycling behaviours. Contrary to expectations, results showed no significant effect of emotion on environmental issue ownership. Study 4 extended this work by testing the effect of the five discrete emotion manipulations in a field study. The sample for the study was 135 office-based employees. Results revealed that the emotion manipulations had a significant effect on proenvironmental behaviour, as measured by requests for information on improving environmental performance. Congruent with findings from Study 3, results of Study 4 demonstrated that emotions of the same valence led to different effects on workplace proenvironmental behaviour. Comparisons of effect sizes across Studies 3 and 4 revealed attenuation of the effect of emotion in an organisational setting. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of emotion as an antecedent of proenvironmental behaviour. Findings demonstrated the significant role of organisational context in the relationship between emotions and workplace proenvironmental behaviour. Indeed, this research demonstrates that emotional reactions can induce proenvironmental behaviour. In a workplace context, however, results revealed that individuals also look to the organisation for cues as to the appropriateness of engaging in such behaviour. This research has implications for theory, research, and practice, and makes a contribution to the three research areas of organisations and the natural environment, environmental psychology, and emotions in organisations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental issues</field><field name="subject">proenvironmental behaviour</field><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="subject">issue ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167564</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Modelling and Intervention of the Spread of HIV/AIDS</field><field name="creator">Asrul Sani</field><field name="description">Since the &#64257;rst cases of HIV/AIDS disease were recognised in the early 1980s, a large number of mathematical models have been proposed. However, the mobility of people among regions, which has an obvious impact on the spread of the disease, has not been much considered in the modelling studies. One of the main reasons is that the models for the spread of the disease in multiple populations are very complex and, as a consequence, they can easily become intractable. In this thesis we provide various new results pertaining to the spread of the disease in mobile populations, including epidemic intervention in multiple populations. We &#64257;rst develop stochastic models for the spread of the disease in a single heterosexual population, considering both constant and varying population sizes. In particular, we consider a class of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). We establish deterministic and Gaussian diffusion analogues of these stochastic processes by applying the theory of density dependent processes. A range of numerical experiments are provided to show how well the deterministic and Gaussian counterparts approximate the dynamic behaviour of the processes. We derive threshold parameters, known as basic reproduction numbers, for both cases above the threshold which the disease is uniformly persistent and below the threshold which disease-free equilibrium is locally attractive. We &#64257;nd that the threshold conditions for both constant and varying population sizes have the same form. In order to take into account the mobility of people among regions, we extend the stochastic models to multiple populations. Various stochastic models for multiple populations are formulated as CTMCs. The deterministic and Gaussian diffusion counterparts of the corresponding stochastic processes for the multiple populations are also established. Threshold parameters for the persistence of the disease in the multiple population models are derived by applying the concept of next generation matrices. The results of this study can serve as a basic framework how to formulate and analyse a more realistic stochastic model for the spread of HIV in mobile heterogeneous populations&#8212;classifying all individuals by age, risk, and level of infectivities, and at the same time considering different modes of the disease transmission. Assuming an accurate mathematical model for the spread of HIV/AIDS disease, another question that we address in this thesis is how to control the spread of the disease in a mobile population. Most previous studies for the spread of the disease focus on identifying the most signi&#64257;cant parameters in a model. In contrast, we study these problems as optimal epidemic intervention problems. The study is mostly motivated by the fact that more and more local governments allocate budgets over a certain period of time to combat the disease in their areas. The question is how to allocate this limited budget to minimise the number of new HIV cases, say on a country level, over a &#64257;nite time horizon as people move among regions. The mathematical models developed in the &#64257;rst part of this thesis are used as dynamic constraints of the optimal control problems. In this thesis, we also introduce a novel approach to solve quite general optimal control problems using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method. The effectiveness of the CE method is demonstrated through several illustrative examples in optimal control. The main application is the optimal epidemic intervention problems discussed above. These are highly non-linear and multidimensional problems. Many existing numerical techniques for solving such optimal control problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, we &#64257;nd that the CE technique is very efficient in solving such problems. The numerical results of the optimal epidemic strategies obtained via the CE method suggest that the structure of the optimal trajectories are highly synchronised among patches but the trajectories do not depend much on the structure of the models. Instead, the parameters of the models (such as the time horizon, the amount of available budget, infection rates) much affect the form of the solution.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS, Mobility, Multiple Patches, Epidemiology, Density Dependent Markov</field><field name="subject">Diffusion Approximation, Epidemic Control, Cross-Entropy Method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and Diet in Roman Britain</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Crane</field><field name="description">The thesis has considered what foods were available to the populations of the Late Iron Age and Roman Britain and the levels of nutrition possible. Evidence for (or the absence of) nutritional deficiency diseases was used to reach conclusions about the standard of health, and knowledge of modern nutritional food models enabled the author to assess the state of health of ancient individuals from a study of the foods to which they had access. To provide a benchmark for what can be ascertained about the Roman&#8217;s choices in food production, selection, cooking, consumption and storage, an examination was made of the sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum, where archaeological investigations have revealed aspects of daily life, trade, living and cooking arrangements, food utensils and human remains. A study of the literary sources determined the attitude of the Romans towards food; it was clear that Romans in the ancient world knew how to source their food, and were aware that, if not properly handled, some food could be detrimental to their health. Sites in Britain from the pre-Roman Iron Age were then considered in regards to food production, selection, cooking and storage, in order to be able to assess the situation after the Roman invasion. For the Roman period, different types of sites were considered: small and larger civilian centres and cemeteries, and military bases. To discover if there were regional differences in diet or nutrition, sites were selected from the North, Midlands, East Anglia, the South and South East and the South West. Also discussed was the role that external influences, features and facilities and occupation of each site had on developing the level of health of their inhabitants. It was found that the native and introduced populations throughout Britain during the Romano-British era did have access to a nutritionally sound food supply, and thus it was possible for them to maintain a healthy diet. Despite the introduction of new foods with the advent of the Romans, there was no discernable difference in the state of health and nutrition from the Iron Age to the Roman, with the exception of dental health, where there was a distinct deterioration as the result of sugar-rich foods being added to the diet. Those cases where the nutritional levels of the people fell below what might be considered conducive to good health were probably due to other factors: it was the physical features or facilities of a settlement (or lack of them) and the occupations and economic status of individuals that actually dictated standards of health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roman Britain, Diet, Nutrition, Food, Human Remains, Iron Age, Ancient Sources, Pompeii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170369</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's for love not money: Queensland graziers' perceptions of sustainable development</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Moffatt</field><field name="description">Despite a National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development and the embodiment of this in numerous national and state statues, environmental degradation continues to occur on rural land. This raises the question of how the primary land managers in Queensland perceive sustainable development. Australia&#8217;s early reliance on agricultural production and international markets contributed substantially to the extensive environmental degradation that has occurred. Consequently economic and environmental issues have dominated the research on sustainable development, with the social dimension relatively neglected. In addition, despite the large quantity of work that has been conducted with farmers and graziers, little is known about how either of these types of land managers interpret sustainable development. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in-depth understanding of graziers&#8217; perceptions of sustainable development to make a contribution to this area. An exploratory interpretative approach was taken to conduct this investigation because previous research had been limited. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted with 57 Queensland graziers in the tropical savannas in a case study with two locations &#8211; the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Central West. This approach was supported by participant observation and a brief questionnaire to provide background information. The fieldwork was conducted over a period of five months which allowed analysis to be conducted as the study progressed. Most of the graziers were interviewed on their properties with the goal of adding richness to the data and assisting with interpretation. Several bodies of literature have been used to interpret the results of this study. Areas of the sustainable development literature relevant to this thesis are reviewed to provide a context for the thesis. The literature on structural change in Australian agriculture provides a background to the broad influences on the agricultural sector and farmers. Also reviewed are the approaches taken to change the land management practices of farmers. The enduring value of farming and the changing values of rural land use are explored through a review of agrarianism, the goals and values of farmers and the post-productivist transition. The results for both study locations showed that these graziers preference the economic dimension of sustainable development over the environmental and social dimensions. The rationale for this preference is that maintaining economic viability will allow them to achieve their social goal &#8211; to continue their preferred way of life. A strong focus therefore, is on economic viability as a means to a social end. The objective is to overcome the constraints of being market and season dependent and the costs of operating in rural and remote locations through a whole-of-enterprise business management approach. The need for graziers to continue increasing their productivity to remain economically viable and to continue being competitive in international markets, challenges their ability to balance the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. For some the environmental dimension of sustainable development may be compromised to accommodate their economic priorities and social goals. A perceived future threat, more so for Gulf graziers, arises from the belief that they and their interests are marginalised through consultation processes. This contributes to their belief that the government prioritises Aboriginal land rights and environmental protection interests over their production interests. They believe that if this continues their future is at risk through further decreases to the security of their tenure. The results of this study suggest that a more innovative and integrated approach will be required to meet the challenges of sustainable development in these areas, in early twenty-first century Australia. The holistic approach from a social science perspective has provided an understanding of what graziers value and why. These insights contribute to knowledge of how to progress sustainable development. They could be tested with other types of land managers and as a foundation on which to build a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable development; graziers; farmers; agriculture; land management; business</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170415</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological Responses to Acute Global Hypoxia and their Relationship to Brain Injury In the Newborn Piglet: What are the Important Responses?</field><field name="creator">Thomas Harris</field><field name="description">Perinatal asphyxia is a significant contributor to neonatal brain injury. In the clinical environment there is variability in the severity of neural injury in neonates with similar clinical histories. Whilst the duration and intensity of hypoxia is well known to influence the severity of neurological outcome, the global physiological responses to hypoxia may also affect the subsequent variability in neurological outcome. The first step in this project was to identify which physiological response/s during a constant global hypoxic-ischemic insult influence the severity of neurological outcome in the newborn piglet and to assess the relative importance of these responses. Hypoxia/hypercapnia was induced in anaesthetized piglets by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to 0.1 (10%) and the ventilation rate from 30-10 breaths per minute for 45 minutes. Neurological outcome was determined by using functional markers including aEEG amplitude and cerebral impedance, and the structural marker microtubule associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry at 6 hours post hypoxia. The results from the initial study indicated that there was significant variability in neurological outcome following a constant hypoxia/hypercapnia insult. Serum cortisol concentrations were highly variable at the end of hypoxia (mean &#177; SD; 240.7 &#177; 90.9 nmol/L) and associated with cardiovascular function (time heart rate below baseline; r = 0.69) and neurological outcome (r = 0.70). Cardiovascular function (time heart rate was below baseline) and neurological outcome were strongly associated (r = 0.77). In this study we observed an oscillating pattern in cardiovascular function during hypoxia in some animals. In the regression analysis variability in cortisol concentrations and cardiovascular function explained 68% of the variability in the severity of neurological outcome. Additional physiological factors did not improve the strength of the association with neurological outcome. The variability in the physiological responses, particularly cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hypoxia may be more important determinants of neurological outcome then previously recognised. Results from the initial study opened up several questions about the relationship between cortisol and cardiovascular function during hypoxia and the relationship to the subsequent neurological outcome. Since variability in cortisol concentrations was associated with both cardiovascular function and neurological outcome the second step of this thesis was to investigate what factors contributed to the variability in serum cortisol concentrations during hypoxia. It is important to understand why some individuals produce more cortisol than others, and as a result are protected against brain injury. The aim was to determine if the variability in serum cortisol concentrations was the result of variability in ACTH concentrations during acute global hypoxia. The results from this study showed that early changes in serum cortisol concentration (15 minutes) were not correlated with ACTH (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.1), however, later changes (30 &#8211; 45 minutes) were (R2 0.45 - 0.68). This suggests that the primary factor controlling serum cortisol concentrations before hypoxia and during later hypoxia is ACTH concentrations. These data suggest that other factors may control cortisol secretion during early hypoxia; a key mechanism responsible for these changes may be the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the maturity of the adrenal medullae. Since, higher cortisol concentrations were associated with better cardiovascular function and neurological outcome. As a result of this observation the aim of this study was to determine if cortisol concentrations during hypoxia are the causative factor responsible for improved cardiovascular function and better neurological outcome. The results from this study showed that manipulating serum cortisol concentrations into high (&lt;500nmol/l) and low (&gt;50nmol/l) levels during hypoxia did not affect cardiovascular function (P = 0.68) or neurological outcome (P = 46). Within each group (low, high and control hypoxia group) there was significant variability in cardiovascular function during hypoxia, which was associated with neurological outcome. (r = -0.63, p = 0.01). This study showed that serum cortisol concentrations during hypoxia are not the causative factor impacting on improved cardiovascular function and neurological outcome. It is possible that factors affecting both cardiovascular function and cortisol production such as activity of the sympathetic nervous system, may be a possible mechanism behind the variability in neurological outcome and cardiovascular function. Additionally, this study showed that cortisol concentrations at 3 hours post hypoxia were associated with neurological outcome (r = -0.67, p = 0.01). The animals with poorer outcome may also be those with greater multi-organ damage and thus reduced ability to clear cortisol from the systemic circulation. In light of this finding it may be interesting to assess cortisol concentration in the human neonate at 3 hours post hypoxia and determine the relationship to neurological outcome. In the final study of this thesis the function of the cardiovascular system during hypoxia was investigated in more detail because of its strong association with neurological outcome (results observed in Chapter 2 and 4. Few researchers have reported on oscillations in cardiovascular function, particularly type-3 waves, during hypoxia in the neonate. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics and occurrence of type-3 waves in the neonatal piglet and their relationship to neurological outcome following acute global hypoxia. The result showed that the development of type-3 waves in cardiovascular function occurred in 56% of animals. An oscillating pattern was significantly associated with better neurological outcome (p = 0.01) and a lower duration of hypotension during hypoxia (p = 0.02), and occurred more frequently in females (p = 0.024). The development of type-3 waves during acute global hypoxia is a key mechanism in promoting natural tolerance; and may be the result of greater activity, maturity or sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system in females compared to males. This may explain the improved neurological outcome following hypoxia in the female neonate seen in the clinical setting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cortsiol</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular function</field><field name="subject">neurological outcome</field><field name="subject">oscillations</field><field name="subject">sympathetic nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170885</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music, the Arts and the Dual Aesthetic in Seventeenth- and Early Eighteenth-Century English Thought</field><field name="creator">Barnaby Ralph</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines affect, rhetoric and aesthetics in relation to English thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, focusing in particular on music. It argues that a &#8220;dual aesthetic&#8221;, or a division in perception of an artistic experience between broad conceptions related to the intellectual and the sensual, was an implied discourse running through discussions of art, philosophy, music, education and other areas. I argue that both seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophers of the arts viewed the intellectual and sensual experiences as different things, and this distinction meant that they felt that an individual could perceive a painting, a work of music or another expression of artistic intent on two levels. A related division is between the macro-rhetorical, or broadly constructional, elements and the micro-rhetorical, or minutiae. In terms of music, ideas of affect and rhetoric were employed in three main ways in the period, given here in increasing order of their level of specific detail. The first was as concepts of general relation between different arts such as poetry, music and painting. Philosophical thought of the period held that the aim of any art was to move the passions and affections, and rhetoric was a template used to establish terms of discussion. The second way in which these ideas could be related to music was as general metaphors, such as the common metaphor of a piece as an oration. The third relation was on the constructional level, where ideas of musical affect were applied to instrumentation, rhythm, dynamics and other areas. Rhetoric served here as a specific constructional model, providing tools such as templates for the general structure of a work and figures that could be used in order to move the passions appropriately. The primary sources consulted are, for the most part, works either written in England, translated into English in the period, or well-known there during the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Many of these were not concerned in the first instance with music, and explored instead aesthetics, philosophy or the arts in general. Such a contextual examination helps clarify terminological confusion, and many terms which have, for example, a musico-rhetorical function can thus be identified. There was no unified theory of affect and the passions, and certainly no definitive catalogue of musico-rhetorical devices in England in this period. Instead, this dissertation looks at commonalities of approach and the chronological development of affective and rhetorical elements in music. To this end, a wide range of sources have been discussed and contextualized, including works on classical rhetoric and its derivatives, education and medicine. General concepts are identified and information is then extrapolated from this. Ultimately, the elements combine in a hierarchy of construction, with overreaching principles coming from rhetoric, broad elements from affective theory and minutiae from both. The dual aesthetic, an implicit principle underlying seventeenth- and eighteenth-century thought about the arts, is thus made explicit in this dissertation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music, affect, rhetoric, aesthetics, England, philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171676</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern-Aware Prediction for Moving Objects</field><field name="creator">Hoyoung Jeung</field><field name="description">This dissertation challenges an unstudied area in moving objects database domains; predicting (long-term) future locations of moving objects. Moving object prediction enables us to provide a wide range of applications, such as traffic prediction, pre-detection of an aircraft collision, and reporting attractive gas prices for drivers along their routes ahead. Nevertheless, existing location prediction techniques are limited to support such applications since they are generally capable only of short-term predictions. In the real world, many objects exhibit typical movement patterns. This pattern information is able to serve as an important background to tackle the limitations of the existing prediction methods. We aims at offering foundations of pattern-aware prediction for moving objects, rendering more precise prediction results. Specifically, this thesis focuses on three parts. The first part of the thesis studies the problem of predicting future locations of moving objects in Euclidean space. We introduce a novel prediction approach, termed the hybrid prediction model, which utilizes not only the current motion of an object, but also the object's trajectory patterns for prediction. We define, mine, and index the trajectory patterns with a novel access method for efficient query processing. We then propose two different query processing techniques along given query time, i.e., for near future and for distant future. The second part covers the prediction problem for moving objects in network space. We formulate a network mobility model that offers a concise representation of mobility statistics extracted from massive collections of historical objects trajectories. This model captures turning patterns of the objects at junctions, at the granularity of individual objects as well as globally. Based on the model, we develop three different algorithms for predicting the future path of a mobile user moving in a road network, named the PathPredictors. The third part of the thesis extends the prediction problem for a single object to that for multiple objects. We introduce a convoy query that retrieves all groups of objects, i.e., convoys, from the objects' historical trajectories, each convoy consists of objects that have traveled together for some time; thus they may also move together in the future. We then propose three efficient algorithms for the convoy discovery, called the CuTS family, that adopt line simplification methods for reducing the size of the trajectories, permitting efficient query processing. For each part, we demonstrate comprehensive experimental results of our proposals, which show significantly improved accuracies for moving object prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods, while also facilitating efficient query processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moving Objects Databases</field><field name="subject">Predictive Query Processing</field><field name="subject">Spatio-Temporal Data Mining</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171706</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploiting the Internet for Teacher Professional Development and Mathematics Teaching and Learning: An Ethnographic Intervention</field><field name="creator">Sitti Maesuri Patahuddin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to investigate how primary teachers in Queensland, Australia can make use of the Internet for professional development and to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. As a result of this study, implications for using the Internet for the professional development of Indonesian mathematics teachers in primary schools were drawn. The genesis of the study had emerged from reflecting upon my personal experiences in using the Internet for my own professional learning, by exploring education phenomena related to the Internet in Indonesia and Australia, and identifying gaps in research as a result of my literature review. I argue that the Internet has potential as a medium for professional development and for teaching and learning mathematics. However, little is known about the personal and professional characteristics of teachers who use the Internet to promote and renew their professional knowledge and to support their on-going learning process as well as to be good facilitators for &#8216;new learners&#8217;. The literature review establishes the need for investigating how teachers can use the Internet for professional development and for teaching and learning mathematics. The literature review also examines the characteristics of effective professional development, identifies inadequacies in existing professional development programs, and examines the potential advantages and limitations of using the Internet for professional development. The review suggests that there is a need to build a new model of professional development to shed light on how the Internet might be used to support primary mathematics teacher professional development. In this study, two case studies have been conducted. The first case study was of a &#8216;high use Internet (HUI) teacher&#8217; (a teacher who intensively uses the Internet to sustain his/her professional growth as a mathematics teacher) and the second case study was of a &#8216;low use Internet (LUI) teacher&#8217; (a teacher who has not made use of the Internet for those main goals but has a willingness to do so). The researcher learned from the HUI teacher and formulated ways to help the LUI teacher. An ethnographic approach was chosen for this study, as the researcher went into the field for an extended period of time. This study employed multiple data gathering methods, namely: participant-observation, interviews, questionnaires, and written and non-written sources. The research reported in this thesis investigated factors (personal and contextual) that support or inhibit mathematics teachers in making use of the Internet for teacher professional development and for teaching mathematics. The findings support the notion that teachers&#8217; knowledge and beliefs are key determinants in embracing technology as a tool for teaching and learning. The findings are also significant in underscoring the non-linear, interactive and contingent nature of authentic professional development. The significance of this research is that it deepens our understanding about what is necessary for primary mathematics teachers to optimise the potential of the Internet for mathematics teaching and learning both for teachers and students. This study established the extent of the positive and negative potential effects of the Internet for professional development and the difficulties of using only this for professional development. Yet another significant outcome from this research is the construction of a theoretical framework for identifying the implications of using the Internet for professional development of Indonesian Primary teachers and for mathematics teaching and learning in Indonesian primary schools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher professional development</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">low use Internet (LUI) teacher</field><field name="subject">high use Internet (HUI teacher)</field><field name="subject">zone theory</field><field name="subject">Indonesian context</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171711</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With the voice of this calling: The experience of community development practitioners in the organisational context of bureaucracy</field><field name="creator">Lynda Shevellar</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to understand the experiences of community development practitioners who are located in the organisational context of bureaucracies. Over the last decade there has been a revitalised interest in community development as a means of addressing social issues within Australia. Local, state and federal governments, as well as large non-government organisations, have developed policies and programs aimed at building, strengthening, renewing and revitalising communities. At the same time, a set of ideologies have emerged that have given rise to a global neoliberal welfare regime, and that have shaped ways of thinking and behaving within bureaucracies. Whilst much has been written about these two broad trends and their impact upon Australia, what appears to be missing from these analyses is an understanding of the impact upon the actual practitioners operating at the intersection of these forces. This research addresses the gap in the literature between the academic discussion and the personal experience of undertaking community development in bureaucracies. This investigation adopts a qualitative approach. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted with community development practitioners from federal, state and local government and from large non-government organisations in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The interview transcripts were then analysed utilising a framework known as Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) which enabled the responses to be examined through multiple lenses: social, discursive and metaphoric. What this study reveals is that community development practitioners have a largely negative experience of bureaucracies: the work is difficult to do, it is not well understood, and it is not well supported. Whilst this is not particularly surprising, what IS of interest is the level of shock and frustration felt by practitioners, and their lack of preparedness for these experiences. Whilst community development workers have a very good understanding of the content of their practice, what appears to be missing is a critical analysis of their context and themselves as practitioners, and this invites a more negative experience of the work. Practitioners respond to these experiences by distinguishing between themselves as bureaucrats and what they name as their true and authentic selves. They articulate a difference between &#8220;working developmentally&#8221; from within bureaucracies and undertaking what they call &#8220;real&#8221; community development, which occurs &#8220;in community&#8221;. The acts of distinguishing an authentic self and authentic community development are both forms of resistance. However, I suggest that such constructions are largely unhelpful as they construct false binaries which render practitioners ineffective. The work of community development practitioners is compromised because the context in which they are operating is compromised. I also argue that community development students require greater preparation for the organisational context of bureaucracy, which includes understanding not only methodology, but also the objectives, arenas and structures for practice. Practitioners need a deeper understanding of relations of power within these contexts. This requires workers to be clear about their motivations, their commitment and their analysis. Finally I contend that what is required is the creation and sharing of metaphors that articulate a relational rather than individualistic and heroic form of agency. In this way community development theory and practice can shift away from a modernist narrative of development to a discussion of mutual transformation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">human agency</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">metaphor</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171994</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pentecostalism in Urban Java: a Study of Religious Change, 1980-2006</field><field name="creator">Mark Robinson</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the reasons for religious change to Pentecostal Christianity in urban Java during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It investigates the conversion trend to Pentecostal forms of Christianity that has taken place in recent decades in the cities of Java. Why some of Java&#8217;s Muslim urbanites, particularly young traditionalist Javanese Muslims of lower and middle class status, have converted to this ecstatic expression of Christianity since 1980 is the focus of this study. The thesis considers the utility of current social science theories that emphasise social, cultural, political and selected religious factors, to understanding this conversion trend in urban Muslim Java. Socio-political factors, particularly political and social crises, rapid urbanisation, and state support for monotheistic religions; and selected religious factors, mainly delimited religious pluralism and reaction to Islamic extremism, produced a climate in urban Java conducive to conversion to this indigenous, moderately strict, this-worldly focussed and modern Christian movement. While this thesis demonstrates the utility of current social science explanations, it argues that these explanations, which rely solely on socio-political and some religious factors external to the converts, do not fully explain why some of the Muslim inhabitants of the cities of Java have converted to Pentecostal Christianity over other religions, and over other forms of Christianity. I argue that existing social science theory be extended to be more inclusive of specialised aspects of the Pentecostal movement. These specific characteristics are considered under the schema of &#8216;religious experiences and movement specificities&#8217; (REMS), and are particularly concerned with the role of Pentecostal worldview, religious experiences, community and institutional aspects in conversion. This thesis demonstrates the value of an integrated approach to the scientific study of the reasons for religious conversion, one that considers the contribution of external socio-political forces and inner subjective religious experiences, personal faith aspects and specificities of movements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="subject">Urban</field><field name="subject">Pentecostal</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">conversion</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">social science</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:172822</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging with Gender in Public Transport Planning</field><field name="creator">Evelyn H. Ybarzabal</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis investigates the extent to which gender considerations are being incorporated into the planning and policy making of the public transport system in Queensland, Australia. Using public transport in South East Queensland (SEQ) as a case study, this thesis analyses why and how gender issues are still being overlooked and excluded from mainstream planning. It investigates the application of a gender analysis approach in theory and practice and provides recommendations for integrating a gender perspective in the development of public transport policy. The study is beneficial in terms of making contributions to promote better understanding of how feminist theory could enhance the development of public transport policy. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed. Participants were selected from different demographic groups (politicians, bureaucrats, academics, women&#8217;s subgroups and individuals from the broader community) using theoretical/purposive sampling methods. The collection and analysis of data were guided by feminist sociological theory as a framework and gender analysis was utilised in reviewing transport research, policies, programs, plans and legislation. The thesis findings showed that there are gender differentiated behaviours between men and women in relation to their transport needs. In particular, the manner in which men and women behave is linked to an array of underlying factors such as gender relations, the social role of women and their personal circumstances, household structure, transport-disadvantage issues, and their broader socio-economic environment. The research noted that gaps exist in the current public transport delivery in SEQ. Three main categories of issues were identified namely key gender issues, gender-obscured issues and gender-neutral issues. The key gender issues included personal safety and security, time-space pressured travel, lack of adequate facilities, driver&#8217;s knowledge, skills and attitudes, mobility-constraint issues and features of public transport that have gender impacts. The gender-obscured issues included language difficulty, cost and infrequency of service. The gender-neutral issues included but not limited to public transport design, unequal distribution of transport services and impacts specific to areas outside the TransLink network. The research highlights how the issues interlock with the social, economic, cultural, structural and political factors of the environment in which women and men live. The thesis concludes that there is a lack of effective engagement with women, and that greater attention to gender consideration in developing public transport policies is required. While Queensland State Government has made a commitment to improving public transport provision for women, it appears that such rhetoric has not yet been translated into practice. The research also noted that the practicality and political implications of transport policy seem to obtain a higher priority in decision-making domains than gender considerations. Failure to examine both ends of the gender continuum in service delivery will make more difficult the development of public transport policy as a gender-sensitive social policy. Furthermore, public transport policy making should not be undertaken in isolation from other planning activities. Other considerations outside the traditional planning approach have to be examined, so planners will have a greater appreciation of, not only the needs of the conventional public transport users, but also of those not belonging to this category including different subgroups of women. Policy planning often overlooks the construction of women as an homogenous category, without considering that they are a heterogeneous group with tremendous differences in age, ethnicity, religion and class, thus requiring different considerations for policy intervention. Policy planning has been constructed as an exercise with a focus on a narrowly defined scope and immediate concerns, paying little attention to long-term impacts on a broader and holistic level. The consideration of gender in transport planning is a case in point &#8211; gender considerations are important in transport planning not only because there are significant differential impacts between men and women, but also because in the long run, these impacts in turn will have great economic and social implications. Economically, the lack of consideration of gender issues in public transport often results in increased travel time for women, leading to loss in productivity for the economy. Socially, difficulties and inaccessibility of public transport for women, particularly in relation to performing and balancing their care and work duties could also lead to increased stress and tensions, affecting family relations and wellbeing, would also incur considerable social costs. Policy planning tends to assume the position of policy makers and rarely considers the policy impacts from a user or benefactor perspective. In the case of public transport planning, how best an experiential perspective rigorously incorporate the users and gender point of view, will require not only consultation but also political will and commitment. A true incorporation of gender consideration into public transport planning will also require the support of other social policies including welfare policies. Hence, the thesis argues that new ways of researching, designing and planning for public transport as a gendered set of practices are required.

Several blackouts have been reported in the past due to insufficient damping of the oscillatory modes. The starting point to avoid catastrophic behaviors would be to simulate actual power system and study the response of the system under various outages leading to blackouts. Recently, it has been identified that appropriate modeling of the load is necessary to match the actual system behavior with the computer simulated response. This research throws some insight into the detailed load modeling and its impact on the system small signal stability. In particular, Composite load model is proposed and its effect on the system small signal stability is investigated. Modeling all the loads in a large power system would be a cumbersome job and hence the method for identifying the most sensitive load location is also proposed in the thesis. The effect of load modeling on the eigenvalue movement is also investigated. The low damped electromechanical modes are always undesirable in the large inter-connected power systems as they might get excited under some event leading to growing oscillations. Proper damping of these modes is essential for effective and reliable system operation. Power system stabilizers have been proved to be an effective way of damping these electromechanical modes. The optimal number and location of PSS to effectively damp the modes via improved Differential algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the effect of TCSC, series compensated FACTs device, on enhancing the system damping is investigated. A fixed order model matching technique is presented to design a damping controller for the TCSC. With the increasing global pressure for reducing carbon emissions, there is a great amount of interest in the renewable sources of energy, particularly Wind Energy Conversion Systems. Of all the present methods of wind generation systems, Doubly Fed Induction Generation (DFIG) based wind farms are gaining popularity. The comparison of various methods of wind generation techniques is presented. In particular, the impact of DFIG based wind farms on the system small signal stability is investigated in this work. Co-ordinated tuning of the controllers is performed using Bacterial Foraging Technique, which is another member of Evolutionary algorithms. Damping controller for the DFIG system is proposed to enhance the damping of the electromechanical modes. Results have proved the effectiveness of the control methodology. The contributions made in this thesis could be utilized to promote the further development of the damping controllers for large power systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">Power system stability, small signal stability, load modeling, FACTS devices, TCSC, PSS, Eigenvalues, Sensitivity analysis, damping controller, Wind Energy Conversion Systems, Wind farms, Wind turbines, Doubly Fed induction Generator (DFIG).</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174625</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65279;BETWEEN TWO WORLDS: CLAUDIO POMPILI, ITALIAN-AUSTRALIAN COMPOSER</field><field name="creator">Claudio Pompili</field><field name="description">Between Two Worlds, with its implied dualities, alludes both to my Italian and Australian backgrounds and to my popular and art music experiences. The dissertation comprises of analyses of and critical commentary on a selection of compositions from instrumental through electroacoustic to musico-dramatic works. Further, Part I presents a pr&#233;cis of relevant background in order to locate the compositions within both Australian contemporary classical music and international settings, and Part I includes sections on analytical methodology and compositional technique. Compositions examined in Part II illustrate the salient features of compositional technique, specific influences and aesthetic concerns. Both instrumental works, Fra l&#8217;urlo e il tacere and Ridendo vado sul fiume, were written during the earlier period of the doctoral candidature. The discussion presents not only the seminal influences including the use of interval-class (ic) construction and music technologies but is also intended to guide the reader from solo and chamber instrumental writing through sound design and electronic soundscape composition towards the larger-scale, musico-dramatic works. Part III discusses the major contribution. It is concerned with three mixed-media musictheatre compositions that were created in the period 2000&#8211;08 and which explore crossdisciplinary relationships. Whilst maintaining a continuous development of style, the works are on a larger scale in all respects: involve national (The Last Child and Touch Wood) and international (Lontano Blu) production teams and a greater number of performers; are interdisciplinary, conceptually more complex and multilayered, and longer in duration; include extensive use of music technologies, multimedia and multichannel surround sound in performance; and use graphic/text/prose scores. By their very nature, these compositions involved significant collaborative endeavour not only with the key members of the creative teams, such as artistic directors, writers and set designers, but also the performers in general and musicians in particular. The collaborations included development of the conceptual structures of the works with the creative teams and &#8216;hands on&#8217; interaction with the musicians in shaping the sound in real time through group-devised processes where appropriate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410000 The Arts</field><field name="subject">CLAUDIO POMPILI, ITALIAN-AUSTRALIAN COMPOSER</field><field name="subject">australian composition, contemporary classical music, music theatre, electroacoustic, electronic music, sound design, italo-australian</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174467</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community level serious leisure networks</field><field name="creator">Lawrence Bendle</field><field name="description">Abstract Drawing on the serious leisure perspective, social world theory, and social network analysis this thesis utilizes an exploratory methodology to develop a structural view of a social world network of 49 social actors comprised of the grassroots associations and the allied organisations expressly concerned with amateur artists in a regional Australian city. Semistructured interviews were conducted with spokespeople in leadership and management roles with the associations and organisations. The purpose of the interviews was to develop an understanding of the key attributes of the grassroots associations and the function of the allied commercial, cultural, and educational organisations, and to discover the patterns of links between these two types of social actors. In addition, the interviews explored the types of social world participation among the associational memberships; and the role, rewards, and costs experienced by the spokespeople who were fulfilling coordinating duties in the grassroots associations. The research found that associations of amateur artists were active in the local community coordinating their memberships, activities, and assets to provide calendars of events for the participants in a regional social world of the creative arts and that, the allied organisations provided complementary goods and services. Further, it emerged that links of varying intensity connecting the associations and organisations coalesced into a network. This comprised a cluster of social actors connected by their concern with actors, dancers, and musicians; a cluster of social actors connected by their concern with craft practitioners, community cultural development workers, visual artists, and writers; and of social actors with bilateral links connecting the two clusters. Also mixed serious leisure emerged as a significant mode of participation among the sample of grassroots association spokespeople who were interviewed and this was important to the sustainability of their associations over time. There are three major outcomes from the research. First, structural concepts from social network analysis in combination with social world theory developed into definition of a community level serious leisure network; second, this definition proved empirically viable in the research context, and third, a model to depict the phenomenon of a community level serious leisure network has emerged from the exploratory process. The findings have both theoretical and empirical implications. Theoretically, they assist research into the structure of community level leisure provision. The findings also encourage investigation of mixed serious leisure. Empirically, the application of network knowledge to improve community leisure resources can improve the outcomes for the social actors involved and the community in which they are embedded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">serious leisure, social network analysis, social worlds, creative arts, community</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177143</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literature&#8217;s Ghosts: Realism and Innovation in the Novels of Christine Brooke-Rose and A. S. Byatt</field><field name="creator">Andrew Williamson</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the novels of Christine Brooke-Rose and A. S. Byatt in order to question the extent to which contemporary British novelists are free to innovate with the forms of literary realism, forms that have a long and valued tradition in British literary production. Both authors, I argue, have reassessed the limits of the realist novel over the course of their careers, and the specific ways in which they engage with, or depart from, their literary inheritance are discussed. The introduction contextualises the literary climate out of which the two writers emerge. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was a commonplace of literary criticism to declare the &#8220;death of the English novel.&#8221; In the years following modernist experimentation, British novelists made a conscious return to the mimetic realism of the nineteenth century. Rather than the intellectual sterility that is often assumed to have dominated this period, I observe that there were in fact many writers who were continuing the innovations of the preceding generations, Christine Brooke-Rose and A. S. Byatt amongst them. To view realism to be in need of renewal is first of all to view literary production in terms of an ontological-historical distinction of texts as types of objects. It may be also to neglect the ways in which literary history is always already in dialogue with the present. Both authors have made concerted efforts to refresh literary realism; however, they have proceeded in very different ways. Brooke-Rose has experimented with the content and the form of the novel in order to renew conventions she insists are fatigued or overworked. The novels she has published since 1964 depart radically from what would ordinarily be recognised as realist fictions as they make no attempt to disguise their own textuality. Byatt, on the other hand, has reassessed realism through the forms of realism itself. Through an engagement with literary history, she revisits realism to pursue what has always been of value within it. In so doing, she creates a developmental model of literary production in which literary debts are made visible in the work of the contemporary writer. Chapter One examines Thru, the literary experiment for which Brooke-Rose is most celebrated. My starting point is her claim, following Roland Barthes&#8217;s S/Z, that she is the author of writerly as opposed to readerly texts. I argue that to establish any such easy opposition is to neglect Barthes&#8217;s departure from the polemicism that had marked his earlier work. Rather than interrogating how well her texts are supported by her claim to be writerly, I turn the opposition around in order to examine precisely how Barthes&#8217;s readerly operates within Thru. Through a close reading both of the novel and of Barthes, I illustrate that many characteristics of literary realism that Brooke-Rose argues are exhausted, in particular characterisation and narration, are still operating in Thru. Chapter Two develops Brooke-Rose&#8217;s opposition of readerly and writerly in order to examine its consequence for her own experimental writing. Here I return to Thru to demonstrate the ways in which Barthes&#8217;s readerly and writerly operate as interdependent processes rather than as opposing terms. I then reconsider her earliest work, a period she has since disavowed. I argue that rather than a separation, there is a continuum between her earliest works and her later, more experimental, writing that has not been recognised by the author or her critics. In Chapter Three I turn my attention to Byatt&#8217;s insistence on a developmental model of literary production. Here I identify the role that evolutionary narratives play in her texts. Two of her works, Possession and &#8220;Morpho Eugenia&#8221; are set largely in 1859, a year in which a specific epistemological emergence was to reconsider genealogical relations. In this chapter I examine the writings she invents for her characters and argue that she takes metaphors from natural history in order, not only to show the close relationship between literature and natural history, but to provide her reader with a framework of literary-generational descent. Chapter Four examines more closely the ways in which Byatt converses with her literary predecessors. She offers a version of realism that has always been concerned with perception, and with the impossibility of translating that perception into verisimilar fiction. In this chapter I identify the role that art works play within two of Byatt&#8217;s earlier novels, The Virgin in the Garden and Still Life, as she finds in them the same metaphorical ambiguities that bind the language of the novelist to imprecision. I then examine the ways in which metaphor works in these novels to elude precise signification of meaning. Chapter Five returns to Byatt&#8217;s neo-Victorian texts, Possession and Angels and Insects, and examines the author&#8217;s ventriloquism of her Victorian characters, which includes Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Arthur Hallam. Ventriloquism, I argue, is concerned with a remembrance of the literary dead within the present work and is thus an expression of mourning. However, to avoid melancholia the new text must also emphasise its difference from that which is being ventriloquised. I then discuss Byatt&#8217;s focus on nineteenth-century spiritualism, as it is through the trope of the s&#233;ance that she reconsiders the afterlife of literary history itself. The final chapter examines the role of the critic. The mourning of Byatt&#8217;s fictionalised Tennyson is singular and overpowering. Chapter Six begins with a consideration of two of Possession&#8217;s critics, Mortimer Cropper and Leonora Stern, whose readings, I argue, are similar to Tennyson&#8217;s mourning in their inhospitality to other readings, other mournings of the literary text. I compare Cropper and Stern to Possession&#8217;s other critics, Roland Michell and Maud Bailey, whom Byatt places in the role of literary heir. Not only do Roland and Maud display an essential respect for the texts that they study, but also their reading is open to revision. The literary text, as Barthes argues, must always keep in reserve some essential meaning. Only through interpretive revision, Byatt implies, is the promise of this hopeful-yet-impossible revelation made to the reader.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">a. s. byatt, british literature 1945-, christine brooke-rose, experimental novel, haunting, influence, literary history, neo-victorian novel, realism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177169</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology, demography and conservation of rays in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Simon Pierce</field><field name="description">Thirteen elasmobranch species were collected during a four year seine-net survey of the intertidal margins of Moreton Bay, a large subtropical embayment in southeast Queensland, Australia. The inshore elasmobranch fauna of Moreton Bay is relatively species rich in comparison to sites elsewhere in Australia, emphasising the regional importance of this ecosystem. Stingrays were the most common large predators in the intertidal, with overall catches dominated numerically by the blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii (53.8%) and the estuary stingray Dasyatis fluviorum (22.2%). The biological and demographic characteristics of these two species were examined in detail. Neotrygon kuhlii ranged in size from 11.5 &#8211; 46.5 cm disc width (WD), with 50% maturity in females at 31.4 cm WD and 6.32 years old and at 29.4 cm WD and 3.95 years in males. Neotrygon kuhlii has a synchronous annual reproductive cycle, producing one litter of 1 &#8211; 3 pups (mean of 1.67 &#177; 0.71 S.D.) in the late Austral summer after a four month gestation. Maximum age estimates of 13 and 10 years were obtained from females and male N. kuhlii, respectively. Annual band pair deposition was confirmed through the recapture of four wild calcein-injected individuals from 22.7 to 30.2 cm WD. A three parameter power function provided the best statistical fit to age-at-size data for both sexes, providing parameter estimates of y0 = 163.13, a = 58.52 and b = 0.58 for females and y0 = 165.13, a = 59.02 and b = 0.54 in males. Individual growth rates obtained from tagged specimens were not qualitatively different to modelled growth predictions. Tagging studies produced a total recapture rate of 16.1%, with individual rays at liberty for up to 1081 days. Direct estimates of instantaneous mortality for N. kuhlii were derived by creating catch curves for both sexes from age-frequency keys. Mortality was estimated at 0.171 &#177; 0.024.yr-1 S.E. in females, corresponding with a population growth rate of 1.00.yr-1 based on deterministic matrix demographic model predictions, and 0.345 &#177; 0.022.yr-1 S.E. in males. Seven age-independent and two age-dependent indirect mortality estimates produced negative population growth rates of 0.84 to 0.98.yr-1. Elasticity results were relatively robust to mortality estimates, with juvenile survivorship contributing 74-75% of total elasticity under all scenarios. Dasyatis fluviorum is endemic to near-shore, estuarine and riverine habitats along the eastern coast of Australia. Previous records of the species from northern Australia and New Guinea appear to be misidentifications of other, similar species. Dasyatis fluviorum was caught at 15.5 cm to 76.2 cm WD in Moreton Bay, with 50% maturity occurring at 63 cm WD (13.40 years) in females and 41.2 cm WD (6.97 years) in males. Maximum age estimates of 21 and 16 years were obtained from females and males, respectively. The Gompertz growth function provided the best fit to estimated age data in female D. fluviorum, providing parameter estimates of WD&#8734; = 100.3 cm, k = 0.09.yr-1 and t0 = 5.66. The modified two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the best fit to male size-at-age data, providing parameter estimates of WD&#8734; = 73.4 cm, k = 0.10.yr-1 and b = 0.86. An annual reproductive cycle in female D. fluviorum was hypothesised based on preliminary reproductive data. Fecundity estimates were derived from the related D. americana for input into deterministic and stochastic demographic models. Six out of nine indirect mortality estimates produced positive population growth in deterministic models, with a probabilistic estimate of 1.02.yr-1. Elasticity results were robust to model structure, mortality and fecundity estimates, with juvenile survivorship comprising 74-78% of total elasticity under all scenarios. Both N. kuhlii and D. fluviorum provide interesting case studies in elasmobranch conservation. Neotrygon kuhlii is a common bycatch of demersal prawn-trawl fisheries in Australia. Although mandatory turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) exclude most large vertebrates from trawl catches in Australian waters, their benefits in the reduction of smaller elasmobranch bycatch has not been empirically tested. The results of deterministic demographic models show that TEDs can, in principle, mitigate the impacts of trawl fisheries by partially excluding highly-elastic large juvenile age-classes. However, N. kuhlii is the largest of the four Neotrygon species found in Australian waters and bycatch of the three smaller species may be less reduced by current bycatch reduction technologies. Dasyatis fluviorum is affected by a suite of anthropogenic threats in its near-shore and estuarine habitats including commercial and recreational fisheries, habitat modification and pollution. Within Moreton Bay, 10.8% of the surveyed population bore evidence of past interactions with fisheries as evidenced by retained hooks or mutilated tails. Deep-hooking resulted in significant pathological effects including fibrocollagenous scar tissue masses, peritonitis and hepatitis. Stochastic demographic scenarios were created to model the potential effects of low (0.02 yr-1), medium (0.05 yr-1) and high (0.10 yr-1) rates of additive anthropogenic mortality to simulate stage-specific conservation interventions on D. fluviorum. Removing anthropogenic mortality on juvenile age-classes provided the largest benefits in terms of reducing population decline. The probability of the species&#8217; conservation status declining further to Endangered, based on IUCN criteria, ranged from 39% to 100% under these mortality scenarios if no conservation measures were applied.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">Stingrays</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Recreational fishing</field><field name="subject">Bycatch</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177579</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Before everything, remain Italian": Fascism and the Italian population of Queensland 1910-1945</field><field name="creator">Brown, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Italian diaspora</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland history</field><field name="subject">Fascism</field><field name="subject">Ethnic politics</field><field name="subject">Transnationalism</field><field name="subject">Catholicism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177581</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advances in Cross-Entropy Methods</field><field name="creator">Thomas Taimre</field><field name="description">The cross-entropy method is an established technique for solving difficult estimation, simulation, and optimisation problems. The method has its origins in an adaptive importance sampling procedure for rare-event estimation published by R. Y. Rubinstein in 1997. In that publication, the adaptive procedure produces a parametric probability density function whose parameters minimise the variance of the associated likelihood ratio estimator. This variance minimisation can also be viewed as minimising a measure of divergence to the minimum-variance importance sampling density over all members of the parametric family in question. Soon thereafter it was realised that the same adaptive importance sampling procedure could be used to solve combinatorial optimisation problems by viewing the set of solutions to the optimisation problem as a rare-event. This realisation led to the debut of the cross-entropy method in 1999, where it was introduced as a modification to the existing adaptive importance sampling procedure, with a different choice of directed divergence measure, in particular, the Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy. The contributions of this thesis are threefold. Firstly, in a review capacity, it provides an up-to-date consolidation of material on the cross-entropy method and its generalisations, as well as a collation of background material on importance sampling and Monte Carlo methods. The reviews are elucidated with original commentary and examples. Secondly, two new major applications of the cross-entropy methodology to optimisation problems are presented, advancing the boundary of knowledge on cross-entropy in the applied arena. Thirdly, two contributions to the methodological front are (a) an original extension of the generalised cross-entropy framework which enables one to construct state- and time-dependent importance sampling algorithms, and (b) a new algorithm for counting solutions to difficult binary-encoded problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">cross-entropy</field><field name="subject">importance sampling</field><field name="subject">rare events</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177603</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of a bioinformatic/biochemical hybrid approach to determine the structure of protein complexes and multi domain proteins.</field><field name="creator">Dmitri Mouradov</field><field name="description">A recent shift towards proteomics has seen many structural genomics initiatives set up for high-throughput structure determination using traditional methods of x-ray crystallography and NMR. The next step in the proteomic revolution focuses on the interplay of multi-protein complexes and transient protein-protein interactions, which are involved in many cellular functions. Greater understanding of protein-protein interactions will inevitably lead to better comprehension of the regulation of cellular process, which has implications in biomedical sciences and biotechnology. Even though many high-resolution initiatives focus on proteins and protein complexes, their structure-determination success rates are still low. An emerging approach uses chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry to derive a set of sparse distance constrains, which can be used for building models of proteins and to map out residues in protein interaction interface based on partial structural information. This technique allows low-resolution identification of protein structures and their interactions in cases where traditional structure determination techniques did not produce results. Chemical cross-linkers have been successfully used for many years in identifying interacting proteins. However, recent advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the identification of exact insertion points of low-abundance cross-links and hence has opened up a new perspective on the use of cross-linkers in combination with computational structure prediction. For protein interaction studies, the approach uses chemical cross-linking information with molecular docking, so that the cross-links are treated as explicit constraints in the calculations. This study focuses on a low-cost and rapid approach to structure prediction, where partial structural information and distance constraints can be used to obtain the relative orientation of interacting proteins and domains, specifically as a rescue strategy where traditional high resolution structure determination methods were unsuccessful. This hybrid biochemical/bioinformatics approach was applied in the determination of structure of the latexin:carboxypeptidase A complex, and succeeded in achieving 4 &#197; rmsd compared to the crystal structure determined subsequently (Mouradov et al., 2006). Application of the bioinformatics/biochemical approach to multi-domain proteins was carried out on murine acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (Acot7). X-ray crystallography provided structures of the two separate domains of Acot7, however the full length protein did not crystalise. Combining chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, molecular docking and homology modeling we were able to reconstruct how the two domains are arranged in the full length protein (Forwood et al., 2007). Limitations of this technique caused by the enormous complexity of the cross-linking reaction mixtures were identified and emphasized by analysing a large (four protein) complex of DNA polymerase III, where only one inter-protein cross-link was identified. A rapid and cost-effective method for identification of cross-linked peptides using a commercially available cross-linker was developed as part of the overall aim of streamlining the hybrid biochemical/bioinformatics in order for it to become a generally applicable technique for rapid protein structure characterisation (King et al., 2008). Finally an in-house software package was developed for assignment of cross-linked peptides based on m/z values.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cross-linking; mass spectrometry; molecular docking; low resolution structure determination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177658</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Courting Controversies: Salman Rushdie, the Novelist and Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="creator">Sui-sum-grace Wong</field><field name="description">Salman Rushdie is one of the world&#8217;s most pre-eminent writers of contemporary literature. He is best known as a literary author who has written the controversial religious satire in The Satanic Verses, which brought him a prolonged death threat imposed by Islamic authorities. The novel Midnight&#8217;s Children won the prestigious Booker of Bookers prize in 1993 and the Best of the Booker award in 2008. Throughout his writing career, however, he has exceeded his role as a novelist and shown his commitment to using his fame and cultural authority to open debates and publicize his opinions on social and religious issues and world politics. This thesis analyses the various aspects of controversies surrounding Rushdie, as an elite transnational author, a literary celebrity, a public intellectual and an outspoken critic on sensitive topics. It comes to examine the social significance of public personas and the nature of complexity embedded in their career. Rushdie&#8217;s presence draws the media&#8217;s attention, and more often than not, instigates international disputes and contentions. By looking at different aspects of Rushdie&#8217;s identity, the thesis addresses controversies raised by his diverse roles and his traversing of spaces in the cultural industry &#8211; in academia, the book market, public forums, talk shows, celebrity jamborees and even fashion magazine dinner parties. As an elite postcolonial writer, does his iconic status &#8220;compromise&#8221; him in the literary field by the generation of exotic cultural stereotypes and the exploitation of his Indian upbringing? What can literary and cultural critics do to work beyond condemning this trend? As a literary celebrity and public intellectual, do his involvements in publicity activities and New York&#8217;s celebrity circuit make him abandon the professional integrity and the time-honored &#8220;disinterested&#8221; position of the writer? How should the reader understand the connections between the media and the author, and the novel and popular culture? In addition, given his deeply skeptical position on religious matters, how does the writer understand the world of Islam, and how does this understanding underpin his antagonistic relationship with the fundamentalists? Addressing these questions, the thesis is by no means an account of a single writer&#8217;s life and career, but suggests that the complexity of intellectual life in general is made necessary in a cultural landscape saturated with media hype, publicity maneuvers and commoditization. In such contexts, writers exploring their time must, in different degrees, participate actively in what they write against, and be implicated in these processes. Under the influence of the market, the change in social trends and with their aspired career in mind, it seems that there can be no non-involvement for these individuals. Yet, by taking the case of Rushdie, I also argue that implicit in the novelist&#8217;s self-conscious manipulation of his diverse roles and the parodic metafiction in his work are important indications about the image construction of controversial public personas, the cultural meaning of the novelist as a public intellectual, and the implicated career that a writer may have at the turn of the century.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Controversies</field><field name="subject">Salman Rushdie</field><field name="subject">Novelist</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177662</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive training, conflict resolution, and exercise: Effects on young adolescents' well being</field><field name="creator">Mark Taylor</field><field name="description">Abstract By 2020 the World Health Organisation has predicted that depression will be the largest cause of disease burden in the world (Ellen, 2002). This study investigated the effects of three interventions (Explanatory Style, Conflict Resolution, and Exercise) on the level of well-being of adolescents from the middle years of schooling. The research consisted of three studies. Study 1 involved the design of a Student Perception Questionnaire. The 28&#172;&#8211;item Student Perception Questionnaire was created to measure the outcomes of the three interventions and was trialled on 215 Middle School students. A Principal Components analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on the data retrieved from the respondents, and all items were retained on the questionnaire, although four factors did not show a .30 loading. Study 2, a Pilot Study, was conducted with three students to trial the interventions and measures in preparation for the final study. It included the collection of qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data was gained from interviews held with the students, parents, and teachers. Study 2 revealed that the interventions and the measures used to determine the effectiveness of the interventions would be suitable for Study 3. Study 3 was the full intervention that involved 25 students in an intervention group and six students in a no-intervention group. The 25 students were allocated to six groups that were engaged in a counterbalanced design study using the Explanatory Style, Conflict Resolution, and Exercise interventions. The group of six students was used as a comparison group. The results showed that students in the intervention group experienced a reduction of internalising behaviours such as withdrawal and depressive symptoms following all three interventions. The program as a whole was successful in reducing depressive symptoms and the interventions individually also significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The intervention group developed more optimistic thinking styles following the explanatory style intervention. Analysis of parent data revealed that parents of the intervention group were experiencing significant feelings of incompetence and guilt towards themselves as parents. In the members of the no-intervention group, having good social skills and a strong support network of friends and family were protective factors against depressive symptoms. The thesis showed that interventions can be used with adolescents that are effective in reducing depressive symptoms and do not have negative side effects, such as those associated with medications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Cognitive training, conflict resolution, exercise, adolescents, well being</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177781</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with miscarriage: Australian women's experiences</field><field name="creator">Ingrid Rowlands</field><field name="description">This thesis combines quantitative and qualitative methods to examine both women&#8217;s psychological wellbeing after miscarriage and the specific coping strategies that are associated with coping well with this event. Chapter 1 reviews the ways in which miscarriage has been defined and its estimated prevalence. As definitions of miscarriage tend to vary across Western countries, the research implications of this are discussed. Chapter 2 reviews the literature related to women&#8217;s psychological responses following miscarriage, discussing the main outcomes which have been examined, including depression, anxiety, stress and grief. As the literature is relatively small, and current research is limited by small and non-representative samples, Chapter 3 takes an epidemiological approach by cross-sectionally investigating the psychological correlates, and relevant sociodemographic, reproductive and health-related variables associated with miscarriage using a large population sample of young Australian women. Sociodemographic and reproductive variables most strongly predicted membership of the Miscarriage and No Miscarriage groups, while psychological wellbeing did not distinguish the two groups in the stepwise logistic regression. Using the same data but applying longitudinal methods, Chapter 4 examined whether trajectories of Mental Health, Stress and Optimism varied over time and according to women&#8217;s miscarriage status. Relevant sociodemographic and reproductive variables identified in Chapter 3 as possible confounding variables were controlled in these analyses. Miscarriage was found to affect trajectories of Mental Health, Stress and Optimism, with poorer outcomes on all variables for women reporting miscarriage by comparison to women who had never miscarried over a seven-year period. Because miscarriage has significant effects on women&#8217;s mental health and wellbeing, the next part of the thesis was dedicated to examining the predictors of, and coping strategies related to, coping well after miscarriage. Since the term coping well is not easily defined, Chapter 5 is a critical review of the theoretical frameworks of coping, with an emphasis on identifying the conceptualisation and measurement problems which have limited advancements in the field. Chapter 6 is a review of the psychological, reproductive and sociodemographic predictors of adjustment to miscarriage, highlighting the conflicting evidence and the need for multivariate methods when analysing these relationships. Using the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#8217;s Health data, Chapter 7 uses longitudinal methods to investigate predictors of Mental Health among young women reporting miscarriage. Optimism, social support and the number of miscarriages were strong predictors of Mental Health among women reporting miscarriage. Chapter 8 is a review of the research which has examined the coping styles and strategies that women use to cope with miscarriage. The majority of this research tends to be of a qualitative nature, and therefore the next step was to complete interviews with nine women to gain a more in-depth understanding of the specific coping strategies related to positive outcomes after miscarriage. Social support was reported as facilitating adjustment to miscarriage, consistent with the quantitative analyses. Acknowledgement and support from health professionals was also described as facilitating adjustment. While the quantitative analyses had also initially suggested that satisfaction with the general practitioner was an important predictor of adjustment, this variable did not reach significance when other reproductive and psychological variables were controlled for. Taking all the results into consideration, it appears that changes to social norms and attitudes regarding miscarriage may help women to cope with this challenging and distressing experience. Interventions to help women cope with miscarriage need to be grounded in an understanding of women&#8217;s need for social and family support, and understanding from health professionals. However, it is essential that interventions should be comprehensively evaluated, and future research in this area is warranted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miscarriage</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Optimism</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">Social support</field><field name="subject">multilevel modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177791</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the rumen microbial community degrading the non-protein amino acid ADAB from Acacia angustissima</field><field name="creator">Erin Collins</field><field name="description">The tropical legume Acacia angustissima exhibits remarkable drought tolerance and can thrive in extreme environments. A. angustissima has been proposed as a protein supplement to improve the nutrition of livestock in Africa, South-East Asia and Northern areas of Australia. The widespread implementation of such supplementation practices with A. angustissima have been impeded due to adverse effects of its consumption in animal feed trials. The amino acid content of the plant has been investigated to assess the putative anti-nutritive factors, as a number of non-protein amino acids are known to result in ill effects in livestock. The non-protein amino acid &#947;-acetyl-2, 4-diaminobutyric acid (ADAB) was determined to comprise above 60% of the total amino acid fraction and this equates to between 1.8 and 2.9% dry matter of the plant. In similar cases where anti-nutritive properties of plants have had deleterious effects on livestock, inoculation with and/or transfers of rumen microorganisms have conferred tolerance. Therefore microorganisms with the ability to degrade ADAB were the target of this research. A polyphasic approach combining both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques was adopted. Initially rumen contents were enriched to select for ADAB degrading microorganisms using the amino acid containing fraction of A. angustissima, and these enrichment cultures provided the basis for investigation into the members of this community responsible for ADAB degradation. A dilution series of an ADAB degrading enrichment culture was carried out in order to provide a source of the enrichment where ADAB degradation was and was not occurring, allowing direct comparison. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene clone libraries were constructed to compare representatives of the ADAB degrading and ADAB non-degrading enrichment cultures with a view to discern the identity of microorganisms integral to ADAB degradation. A defined group of sequences belonging to the cluster IV of the clostridia within the Firmicutes phylum were found only in the ADAB degrading 16S rRNA gene clone library, and were the target of probe design. The 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probe ADAB1268 was designed to target this group of microorganisms specifically. The ADAB1268 probe was synthesised with a fluorescent label and optimised for use in the fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) procedure. Cells hybridising the ADAB1268 probe were numerically dominant within the ADAB degrading enrichment cultures, adding further weight to the hypothesis that this group of microorganisms were involved in ADAB degradation. Attempts to isolate microorganisms that can degrade ADAB in pure-culture were carried out and the phylogeny of the resulting isolates investigated. One isolate PC13 was found to cluster with the 16S rRNA gene clones from the ADAB degrading library targeted by the ADAB1268 probe. Therefore isolate PC13 was the subject of further research. It was found that isolate PC13 carried out complete degradation of up to 10 mM ADAB in growing culture, deaminating the compound. Isolate PC13 is a rod-shaped microorganism that utilises acetate and produces butyrate. Additional experiments using cell extracts were carried out to examine whether this microorganism degraded a range of other substrates, in an attempt to elucidate the process of ADAB degradation. The isolation and identification of an isolate with the ability to degrade the non-protein amino acid ADAB was a significant finding. Little is known about the degradation of non-protein amino acids by rumen microorganisms, and thus this isolate provides opportunities for further investigation into this process. Attaining this isolate also allows us to explore avenues for manipulation of rumen populations to provide protection against the anti-nutritive property of ADAB.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178000</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation and Implementation of a Great Ape Welfare Index</field><field name="creator">Amanda Fernie</field><field name="description">This thesis has the overall aims of creating a welfare-sensitive additive index of captive great ape husbandry using the expert opinion of relevant stakeholders, highlighting the aspects of husbandry requiring most improvement and allowing enclosures in different zoos and wildlife parks to be ranked in a uniform way. I investigated the attitudes of experts on the management of captive great apes to gain a greater understanding of the features of their environment that may be critical in maintaining a high standard of welfare. From the experts ranking of the different Levels of facilities offered to the great apes I constructed an additive index with 17 key attributes with between two and four Levels for each. The Great Ape Welfare Index (GAWI) derived from expert opinion has Social structure, Enclosure appearance, Group size, Enclosure furnishings and Avoidance provision as the most important attributes of a management system. The GAWI was then validated by recording the behaviour of the captive great apes housed in Australian and overseas zoos, and comparing their activity budgets to wild individuals. Using a Penrose Distance Statistic a significant negative correlation was found between Index score and the departure from wild activity budgets. Additionally I found a significant negative correlation between the change in the proportion of time spent resting and the welfare Index score achieved indicating that those great apes housed in enclosures achieving higher Index scores are more active in general. Finally the husbandry and management systems for great apes currently used by zoos globally were investigated and their ranking in the Index were calculated. This allowed the particular aspects of great ape management requiring improvement to be identified for each enclosure. Comparisons of regional means showed that Australian zoos achieved significantly higher Index scores than those in other parts of the world. The proportion of great apes housed in New Zealand zoos reported as displaying an abnormal behaviour was significantly higher than all other regions with the proportion of great apes housed in Australia displaying significantly less abnormal behaviour when compared to the US. The highest index achieved by any enclosure was 97.5 for an enclosure that housed a group of gorillas, with the lowest index allocated was 52.2 for an orangutan enclosure. The presence of abnormal behaviours was also investigated with the most common abnormal behaviours reported being regurgitation and re-ingestion (15.8%), hair plucking (10.2%) and begging (7.9%) with some animals reported as exhibiting four different abnormal behaviours. The GAWI has the potential to improve the captive environments provided to great apes through highlighting the most critical aspects of their husbandry requiring improvement. This should encourage zoos to aim higher than just complying with minimum standards set by their regional zoological associations. As the index correlates with the behaviour of the great apes housed, their behaviour may more closely resemble wild individuals if improvements are made. The GAWI has been compared to two alternative models to investigate whether the methods used to create the index could be simplified while still allowing adequate discrimination between enclosures and species. This index can be adapted for use in other institutions housing great apes and can act as a model to create indices for other species.

Researchers have indicated that clinically significant anxiety can exist in preschool aged children and can be sub-typed into patterns similar to that of older children. This early identification of anxiety has lead researchers to recommend that prevention efforts occur early in the life course (Beinvenu &amp; Ginsburg, 2007), before the onset of disorder(s). Research remains scarce as to when the ultimate time to intervene would be, as anxiety research with young children is minimal. The studies presented in this thesis attempt to expand the current literature within in the area of early childhood anxiety. The first objective of this thesis was to extend the literature in the field of early childhood anxiety by examining the aetiology of anxiety and behavioural inhibition (BI) through the investigation of potential risk factors. This study (Study One) represents one of the first investigations within the research to examine risk factors for early childhood anxiety. Two hundred and thirty-six children aged four to six years participated in this study. Parents of the children completed self-report questionnaires at one time point. Results revealed that BI did not significantly predict anxiety, nor did any of the risk factors significantly predict BI. Significant predictors of anxiety included mother&#8217;s negative affect and mother&#8217;s parenting stress. Father&#8217;s parenting stress was found to play a mediating role between mother&#8217;s parenting stress and child anxiety. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of both parents (directly or through mediation) in the aetiology of early childhood anxiety. The findings of Study One provide important information regarding the aetiology of early childhood anxiety and provide important implications for the development of preventative intervention programs. Study Two sought to examine the efficacy of a preventative intervention program (Fun FRIENDS; Barrett, 2007a) for preschool aged children, delivered as a school- based, universal intervention. This was the first study conducted evaluating the Fun FRIENDS program and was one of only a few prevention trials cited within the literature examining early childhood anxiety. The study involved a cohort of 263 children enrolled in one of 16 preschool classes. Children were aged between four and six years. Schools were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG) or a waitlist control group (WLG). Parents of the children and teachers completed self-report questionnaires at preintervention, postintervention, and at 12-month follow-up (parents in the IG only). Parent report data revealed no significant differences between intervention conditions on anxiety at postintervention, although participants in the IG experienced larger reductions in anxiety than participants in the WLG. Children in both conditions decreased in BI symptoms at postintervention, except for boys in the IG. Significant increases in social-emotional strength were found for girls in both conditions, but not for boys. When examining the IG only over the long-term (pre, post, 12 month follow-up), nearly significant decreases in anxiety were found at postintervention and significant decreases were found again at 12-month follow-up. Improvements in BI were found at all time points for girls but not for boys and improvements on social-emotional strength were found from preintervention to 12-month follow-up, with girls scoring significantly higher than boys. For teacher report, children in the IG improved significantly more on BI compared to the WLG at postintervention indicating that the intervention program may have had a positive impact on these children in learning strategies to manage BI symptoms. However, at pr-intervention, scores on BI were significantly different between the IG and the WLG. Similar to parent report, girls in the IG experienced the largest decrease in BI symptoms at postintervention. On social-emotional strength, children in the IG improved significantly more than children in the WLG at postintervention with girls in the IG experiencing the largest improvement from pre to postintervention. Overall, these findings suggest that the intervention program had a positive impact on some children as evidenced by improvements in anxiety, BI, and social-emotional strength at postintervention and at 12-month follow-up. Parent report indicated that children in the WLG also improved on these measures, making it difficult to contribute positive changes solely to the program. However, teacher report did indicate that children in the IG improved significantly more than children in the WLG. The improvements gained at 12-month follow-up highlight the potential long-term impact of the program although, without a comparison group, it is unknown whether significant differences would exist between both conditions. Implications of these results are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anxiety, prevention, social-emotional competence, resilience, universal prevention, risk factors, protective factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178027</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural Inhibition in Children with ADHD: Does Stimulant Medication Eliminate Potential Deficits?</field><field name="creator">Caroline Johnson</field><field name="description">Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by higher than normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Behavioural inhibition is proposed to be a primary deficit in children with ADHD, and is included as a component of a number of models accounting for the core behavioural symptoms of ADHD. Children with ADHD often show deficits in their performance on behavioural inhibition tasks relative to typically developing children of the same age, although inconsistent findings have been observed. Stimulant medication is associated with reduction in the core symptoms of ADHD in the majority of children. The primary goal of this thesis was to examine the effects of stimulant medication on behavioural inhibition in children with ADHD. Furthermore, this thesis sought to determine whether children with ADHD who have, and have not taken stimulant medication differ from normally developing children in terms of behavioural inhibition. In order to achieve these aims, it was necessary to firstly determine which tasks provide the best measures of behavioural inhibition. While many tasks have been used to measure inhibitory control amongst children with ADHD, it was unclear from previous research which tasks measure the same constructs. Study 1 investigated relationships in task performance among seven measures of inhibitory control, including the Stop-Signal task, Go / No-go task, Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; analogous the not-X Continuous Performance Task), Eriksen Flanker task, Stroop, Opposite Worlds task and Task-Switching task. Significant developmental changes in a variety of cognitive abilities occur across childhood and adolescence. To limit the possibility that developmental changes in task performance would be observed, the age range for children included in the study was restricted to seven to 10 years. Nevertheless, to interpret correlations among inhibition measures from the tasks, it was necessary to determine whether children showed comparable developmental trends in their performance across tasks. Study 1A investigated developmental changes in the performances of the seven tasks purported to measure inhibitory control in normally developing children aged seven to 10 years. The results of this study suggested that the tasks chosen were appropriate for use among this age group, and that there is little change in behavioural inhibition across the seven to 10 years age range. In Study 1B, inhibition measures from each of the tasks were included in an exploratory factor analysis to determine those tasks measuring the same constructs. The results of Study 1B suggested that the Stop-Signal, Go / No-go and SART tasks provided the best measures of the behavioural inhibition construct. Performance on the Eriksen Flanker task was also related to the performance on these tasks, but in a direction contrary to that predicted. The Stroop and Opposite Worlds tasks measured the same construct, which appeared to be interference control. Performance on the Task-Switching task was not related to the performance on any other task, suggesting that this task did not measure behavioural inhibition or interference control. Study 2 investigated the performance of children with ADHD on the three tasks shown to be the best measures of behavioural inhibition in Study 1B (i.e., the Stop-Signal task, Go / No-go task and Sustained Attention to Response task). Children with ADHD were aged from seven to 11 years, and were tested both when they had, and had not taken their regularly prescribed stimulant medication. The performance of children with ADHD on these tasks was compared to that of normally developing children matched in age. The results of Study 2 suggested that stimulant medication leads to significant improvement in behavioral inhibition amongst children with ADHD, such that children with ADHD do not differ from matched controls. However, this effect was not observed across all three tasks. Reasons for this, along with study limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder</field><field name="subject">Behavioural Inhibition</field><field name="subject">Stimulant Medication</field><field name="subject">Interference Control</field><field name="subject">Inhibitory Control</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178030</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the lifelong learner qualities of post-diploma learners pursuing a degree</field><field name="creator">Yuen Lie Lim</field><field name="description">Rapid technological advances and globalization have resulted in the rise of the information era and with it, the emergence of knowledge economies and the call to lifelong learning viewed as necessary for producing skilled workers. This study examines the characteristics of lifelong learners in different environments, in order to understand how education contributes to the development of the lifelong learner, as well as how active pedagogical approaches, namely problem-based learning, may be especially beneficial for developing the lifelong learner. Using a mixed-methods research approach, this exploratory study was conducted on a sample of polytechnic graduates from Singapore who were continuing their learning in bachelor degree programs at different universities. It was guided by a framework of four main attributes which were identified as possible descriptors of the lifelong learner: capacity for self-directed learning, motivation, metacognitive awareness, and learner disposition. Quantitative data were collected via responses to an instrument, the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), while quantitative data were collected through interviews, to capture in-depth information about individuals&#8217; lifelong learner attributes as well as to probe into their experiences in Singapore&#8217;s formal education system that enabled (or hindered) their lifelong learner development. The data generated from the survey and interviews indicated that this group of young learners from Singapore who were continuing their learning journey did manifest some of the qualities of effective lifelong learners. However, there was also some suggestion that their engagement in lifelong learning was not so much from an intrinsic love for learning, but more out of compulsion because of the better job prospects that came with it. Also, despite the aim of the Singapore Ministry of Education to develop lifelong learners under the policy umbrella of Teaching Schools, Learning Nation (TSLN), learners&#8217; experiences suggest that reforms have not reached all secondary schools to the same extent, and that many government schools were still using more didactic teaching rather than learner-centred pedagogies. Cross-case analyses found that the experience of problem-based learning seemed to equip learners with more self-direction in learning, more intrinsic motivation to learn, and a greater metacognitive awareness. At the same time, the positive outcomes of this pedagogy appear to be mediated by the learner&#8217;s own readiness for self-directed learning: learners with lower readiness for self-directed learning appeared to be less able to enjoy the learning benefits of problem-based learning. The study concluded with implications of these findings for the Singapore education system, as well as on problem-based learning as a pedagogy for developing lifelong learners.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lifelong learning</field><field name="subject">problem-based learn</field><field name="subject">Educational Policy</field><field name="subject">knowledge economy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178057</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms in Caenorhabditis elegans</field><field name="creator">Qiang Cheng</field><field name="description">Phosphine, hydrogen phosphide (PH3), gas is a fumigant that is used worldwide to protect stored grain from infestation by insect pests. Despite a long history of phosphine use, little is known about either the mode of action of this compound or the mechanisms whereby insect pests have become resistant. To better understand phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms, a genetically well-characterised model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used in my PhD project. Three previously created phosphine resistant C. elegans mutants (pre-1, pre-7 and pre-33) developed from the wild type N2 strain were used in this study, though analysis of pre-33 was the primary focus. The three mutants were determined to be 2, 5 and 9 times more resistant toward phosphine than was the parental N2 strain by comparison of LC50 values. Molecular oxygen was shown to be an extremely effective synergist with phosphine as, under hyperoxic conditions, 100% mortality was observed in wild-type nematodes exposed to 0.1 mg/l phosphine, a non-lethal concentration in air. All three mutants were resistant to the synergistic effects of oxygen in proportion to their resistance to phosphine with one mutant, pre-33, showing complete resistance to this synergism. I take the proportionality of cross-resistance between phosphine and the synergistic effect of oxygen to imply that all three mutants circumvent a mechanism of phosphine toxicity that is directly coupled to oxygen metabolism. Compared with the wild-type strain, each of the three mutants has an extended average life expectancy of 12.5 to 25.3%. This is consistent with the proposed involvement of oxidative stress in both phosphine toxicity and ageing. Indeed, a correlation between phosphine resistance and resistance to other stressors (e.g. heavy metal, heat and UV) was also detected. On the other hand, no significant difference in methyl viologen sensitivity was found between pre-33 and N2 strains, suggesting that pre-33 mutant does not seem to provide resistance to phosphine via protection against oxidative damage. Additionally, to test for possible involvement of the DAF-2/DAF-16 signalling pathway in the phosphine response, the levels of phosphine sensitivity of mutants in this pathway were tested. Phosphine resistance levels were increased in daf-2 and age-1 mutants but decreased in daf-16 nematodes, which mirrors the longevity phenotypes of these mutants, suggesting some congruence in glucose signalling between the phosphine resistance and longevity traits. In contrast, no congruence is observed between phosphine resistance and oxidative metabolism as the clk-mutation, which disrupts oxidative metabolism does not cause phosphine resistance and neither do the phosphine resistant mutants cause the severe developmental delay of the clk-1 mutation. The phosphine induced time-dependent mortality was assessed in both N2 and pre-33 nematodes at two fixed phosphine concentrations (0.3 and 3.0 mg/l), allowing the determination of minimum exposure periods required for any mortality as well as the exposure time required to achieve 50% mortality. As a result, it was determined that 15 hours of exposure was needed for significant mortality in N2 and pre-33 strain when exposed to 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, respectively; whereas this period is 5 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l phosphine. The fact that the LT50 value for N2 at 0.3 mg/l phosphine is indistinguishable from that of pre-33 at 3.0 mg/l (24.6 and 24.5 respectively) suggests that 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine have the same toxic effects on N2 and pre-33 nematodes respectively. This result is consistent with the finding that pre-33 is ~9 fold more resistant to phosphine than is the N2 strain. Moreover, the LT50 was determined to be 8.4 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, which is only three times faster than pre-33 when exposed to the same level of phosphine. In contrast to the differential toxicity of phosphine between the N2 and pre-33 lines, the delay in reaching reproductive maturity caused by phosphine exposure is indistinguishable between WT and pre-33 nematodes. This indicates that the phosphine induced delay in maturation is independent of the toxic effects of phosphine. Since the inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been proposed as a mechanism of phosphine toxicity, the phosphine effects on cellular ATP metabolism, presented as ATP+ADP content and ATP/ADP ratio, were also assessed. Phosphine exposure (0.3 mg/l, 25 hours) led to a significant decrease in ATP+ADP levels as well as the ATP/ADP ratio in N2 nematodes. Similar results were also detected in pre-33 nematodes when exposed to 3.0 mg/l phosphine for 25 hours. These observations indicate that phosphine can interrupt cellular ATP metabolism, which is associated with phosphine induced mortality. Additionally, the fact that mutant pre-33 can maintain its ATP levels under phosphine exposure at 0.3 mg/l suggests it has a greater ability to maintain mitochondrial function than does the N2 strain. To better understand the mechanism of phosphine toxicity in the wild type N2 strain, gene expression profiling by DNA microarray analysis was employed. A significant overlap between phosphine and DAF-16 regulated genes was detected, supporting the previous finding that the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway can contribute to phosphine resistance. Phosphine exposure also strongly induced xenobiotic detoxification and stress responses, indicating nematodes are able to sense phosphine induced toxic effects and protect themselves by switching on native detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were also up-regulated by phosphine, possibly due to an increase in energy demand caused by increased xenobiotic detoxification activities. Consistent with the previous findings that phosphine delays median reproductive age and reduces fertility, expressions of a large number of genes involved in growth, embryonic development and reproduction were suppressed by phosphine. Moreover, the microarray results of seven genes whose expression levels were significantly altered by phosphine were validated using RT-PCR, confirming the robustness of the microarray results. The most direct way to determine the phosphine resistance mechanism in mutant pre-33 is to identify and characterise the mutation itself. Using a classic F1 test, the resistance mutation in pre-33 was determined to be incompletely recessive. Additionally, using three mapping strategies, the resistance mutation was mapped to Chromosome IV between 12,591,683 and 12,879,637 bp with 45 genes located in this small region. In an attempt to identify the resistance gene, the effect of suppressing each of 28 of the 45 genes in the interval was determined using a commercially available gene suppression library. It was observed that only knockdown of gene vha-7 resulted in a slight decrease in phosphine sensitivity (84.6%) compared to N2 (97.6%). However, this result does not clearly implicate vha-7 as the resistance gene in pre-33. The microarray results indicated that linoleate and arachidonate signalling pathways might be activated by phosphine. This was observed as induction of a phospholipase A2 gene that regulates the release of arachidonic acid from the C-2 position of membrane phospholipids, as well as several CYP genes predicted to catalyse the oxidation of linoleate and arachidonate. Therefore, phosphine effects on the linoleate and arachidonate dependent signalling pathways were assessed. It was found that, in the presence of phosphine, the pre-33 mutant has a greater ability to transform linoleate and arachidonate epoxides to diols than does N2. This activity may help pre-33 to better maintain mitochondrial function and, therefore, ATP metabolism than N2 during phosphine exposure. The microarray results also showed that phosphine exposure caused up-regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, indicating phosphine regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. As expected, a preliminary metabonomic analysis by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) into the effect of phosphine exposure on metabolism in N2 nematodes revealed significant alteration of the metabonomic profile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Longevity</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Metabonomics</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">ATP metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anti-Sectarian Adult Education in Northern Ireland</field><field name="creator">Simone Smala</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an analysis of adult education programs concerned with reconciliation, and more specifically with reconciliation pedagogy used by community organisations in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland for many years was the site of inter-ethnic violence expressed through sectarian and paramilitary presence, but has moved towards a more peaceful, civil society in recent years. This thesis investigates how the role of the citizen-subject in the new Northern Ireland is constituted in adult education programs and how funding regimes govern such community relations initiatives. The thesis offers a critical analysis of interviews with tutors, participants, designers and managers involved in a selected peace and reconciliation course. A broader view on reconciliation pedagogy and curriculum in anti-sectarian adult education in Northern Ireland leads to a closer exploration of social practices and power relations surrounding the chosen course, while drawing upon selected aspects of social theory, Foucauldian discourse analysis and concepts of governmentality. The analysis revealed that the chosen anti-sectarian course, &#8216;Us and Them&#8217; (Workers Educational Association), proposes individualisation and responsibilisation as alternatives to community identities and nationalistic myths of origins. Equal rights are interpreted as equal rights to cultural expressions, and culture is continuously privileged over other structural differentials in Northern Ireland such as poverty, class or colour. &#8216;Us and Them&#8217; is one component of a large machinery of projects designed to address the conflict situation in Northern Ireland. This machinery finds its centre in the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council, which privileges certain knowledges based on cultural consociationalism over others and which distributes funds for peace and reconciliation projects accordingly. Furthermore,the thesis examines how contemporary policy papers addressing community relations shape discourses found in anti-sectarian strategies and the rationales, strategies and policies informing &#8220;Us and Them&#8217;. The aim of the analysis is to explore the power and potential (and the limitations) of individualisation and responsibilisation as techniques in peace and reconciliation pedagogy in post-settlement ethnic conflict situations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Education, adult education, ethnic conflict, governmentality, Northern Ireland, sectarianism, reconciliation, community relations, community relations policy, community relations funding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178621</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spaces of Ageing: the distinctive geographies of residential complexes</field><field name="creator">Maree Petersen</field><field name="description">Abstract Where and how people live in later life is of vital importance to their wellbeing. Yet there has been very little critical attention in gerontology to the growth of large residential complexes being built by developers on urban fringes across Australia. There is no coherent policy relating to older people&#8217;s accommodation, and a general absence in understanding the capacity of these purpose built environments to meet the needs of older people. Further, there is a lack of research that represents the intricate interplay of factors that informs the provision of residential complexes. This research aims to address the critical need to understand the reality of older people&#8217;s lives within these spaces of ageing. It seeks to do this by exploring the experiences and meaning older people resident in these complexes attach to these spaces, as well as investigating the views and knowledge of those responsible for their design and production. A spatial framework, directly informed by Henri Lefebvre&#8217;s theory of social space, provides a holistic means to integrate both the structural and humanistic dimensions of space. This framework guided an exploration of the working knowledge of the professionals involved in the production of residential complexes, as well as how older people use, and create meaning in this living environment. The qualitative research design facilitated the analysis of interviews with professionals and older people, as well as documents and working papers in order to gain a rich understanding of the different dimensions that make up the production of, and life within, residential complexes. The research identified a broad range of implications in relation to the policy and practice of building residential complexes for older people. Of particular note is that the working knowledge of those responsible for the provision of residential complexes is underpinned by a stereotypical approach to ageing which affects their attitudes and assumptions. This is part of a complex array of factors including ageism, the dominance of business acumen, and humanism all resulting in a cultural acceptance of older people&#8217;s accommodation as separate. These findings prompt consideration of who is planning for whom, and who benefits? Findings suggest that for older people residential complexes are an ambiguous place, characterised by tensions. For some residents, the space provides both security and community, enabling them to engage with occupations and relationships. However, for others, the space is limiting, compromising their ability to retain meaning in their lives. In this way, residential complexes are both an enabling and a constraining environment. These findings highlight the inherent difficulty of providing one dominant model for a population with a broad range of needs, experiences and expectations. Whatever their age older people continue to produce space, and this is not only about keeping the past alive, but keeping in touch with the whole of their lives. This entails continuing to form relationships and connecting to the environment, whether that is a garden, the bush or inner city life; and through the signification of objects as both an expression of connection, loss and absence. To reinforce the heterogeneity of older people, place and space for some was not important. This research has important implications for developing policy on ageing and planning the built environment, as well for the application of the theory of social space. Of note is the power and pervasiveness of ageism within professions responsible for the conception and production of residential complexes, and the strength of the dissonance between accommodation, support and care for older people. Important insights were gained about older people&#8217;s use and meaning of their space, notably the need to recognise micro agency and occupation throughout the life course. This thesis draws attention to the complexity of place and space in regard to older people and their living environments and challenges research that adopts a more singular approach. Finally, use of Lefebvre&#8217;s work to drive the approach adopted in this study is a major strength. In particular, the operationalisation of Lefebvre&#8217;s triad of social space in a social context provides a theoretical contribution to social theory, one to be taken up by gerontology and social science.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people, space, Lefebvre, residential complexes, housing policy, planning, ageism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178614</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and power in Burmese history</field><field name="creator">Jessica Harriden</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between women and power in Burmese history, from the third century CE to the present day (2008), in order to identify the sources, nature and limitations of women&#8217;s power. In particular, the thesis aims to resolve the apparent contradiction that Burmese women historically enjoyed relatively &#8216;high&#8217; social status and economic influence, yet for the most part remained conspicuously absent from the public political arena. The author demonstrates that, while some women exercised significant political influence through their familial connections with powerful men, cultural models of &#8216;correct&#8217; female behaviour prevented most women from seeking official positions of political authority. The thesis considers how cultural and political influences &#8211; Buddhism, colonialism, nationalism and militarism &#8211; shaped Burmese concepts of gender and power, which relegated women to &#8216;traditional&#8217; subordinate, supporting political roles. The thesis also explores how the effects of prolonged armed conflict, economic isolation and political oppression have limited women&#8217;s ability to exercise power in military-ruled Burma. The author considers whether the pro-democracy movement and the recent focus on women&#8217;s issues and rights have opened up any new opportunities for women to exercise power both inside Burma and in exile. Finally, the thesis demonstrates that there is a need to critically re-examine traditional historical representations of Burmese women as passive objects with no political agency, both to highlight women&#8217;s use of informal power and to explain why so few women gained access to formal power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Burma</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178726</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Article Omission and Overuse: Syntax and Semantics of the English Article System in Interlanguage Grammar</field><field name="creator">Jun Matoba</field><field name="description">This thesis examines ungrammatical article omission, and overuse of the definite article 'the' in indefinite specific context by Japanese learners of English. This is an area of English grammar that has been considered a major problem for L2 learners (e.g. Ionin, Ko &amp; Wexler, 2004; R. Hawkins et al., 2005, 2006; Trenkic, 2007). The thesis extends the analysis of Japanese learners' interlanguage to the overuse of 'a' in indefinite specific mass contexts by these learners. A detailed analysis of DP structures in Japanese and English leads to the conclusion that Japanese learners, through their L1, are equipped with the linguistic features which map onto articles in English, even though Japanese lacks articles. The thesis examines the syntactic role of articles in rendering predicative nouns argumental (e.g. Chierchia, 1998; Longobardi, 1994) and explores the definiteness contrast marked by 'the' as opposed to 'a/&#248;' with singular count nouns and mass nouns (e.g. J. Hawkins, 1978) at the semantic level. Count/mass distinctions are also examined in detail (e.g. Doetjes, 1997; Jackendoff, 1992) because the 'a' versus '&#216;' contrast clearly relates this distinction. This thesis argues that, despite its lack of articles, the Japanese grammar expresses definiteness and count/mass distinctions through its classifier system. For example, different orderings of the constituents in a classifier phrase induce different interpretations as to definiteness (e.g. Kakegawa, 2004). Further, the thesis shows that some classifiers are incompatible with mass nouns, thus argue that in Japanese, as in English, nouns are associated with the features which underlie the count/mass distinction. Thus, the difficulty that Japanese learners display in mastering the grammar of articles in English is attributed to difficulties in the mapping between their syntactic and semantic underlying knowledge and the surface forms (e.g. Lardiere, 1998) rather than to the need to acquire new features or categories of syntactic or semantic knowledge as the Representational Deficit Hypothesis (R. Hawkins, 2005) claims. This proposal differs from the previous studies that assume that the relevant syntactic category is not present in the learners&#8217; L1 thus not acquirable in the L2 (R. Hawkins et al., 2005; Trenkic, 2007). It also differs from those that suggest that, even when the learners&#8217; L1 does not overtly realize these features (Ionin et al., 2004), the semantic features are available through universal grammar (UG). In order to examine how Japanese learners map syntactic and semantic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles in their English, data were collected via an oral production task and two types of grammaticality judgment tasks. An online judgment task was used to gather evidence for an intuitive type of knowledge of the constraints on article use, while an offline judgment task examined conscious metalinguistic knowledge of articles. Because L2 learners tend to construct and apply various metalinguistic rules as to the use of articles (Goto-Butler, 2002), the examination of both intuitive and conscious knowledge is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the development of the article system in interlanguage grammar. For the mapping of the syntactic knowledge of articles, the omission of articles by Japanese participants is investigated. The investigation focused on singular count nouns because the omission of articles with these nouns is ungrammatical in any context. It was observed that several of the Japanese participants indeed disallowed article omission for these nouns, suggesting that they had acquired the English system of mapping relevant syntactic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles. The thesis also explores the mapping of the semantic knowledge of articles by focusing on the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Previous studies have claimed that the overuse of 'the' is governed by the Article Choice Parameter (Ionin et al., 2004). The findings reported here confirm the tendency to overuse 'the' in indefinite specific (i.e. noteworthy (Ionin et al., 2004)) contexts. However, it was also observed that 'a' was judged acceptable in the same context. The offline grammaticality judgment task revealed that the choice of 'the' in this context may have been affected by metalinguistic knowledge. Thus, the findings are not in agreement with the hypothesis that a parameter governs the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Additionally, the thesis examines the overuse of 'a' in mass contexts. Though small in number, the participants who make inconsistent judgments for the same noun showed a tendency to accept the use of 'a' in specific contexts (i.e. de re specific) and reject it in non-specific contexts. It is argued that the feature [+specific] may be mapped onto 'a' in mass contexts in these learners&#8217; grammar. Based on these findings, the thesis explores how the syntactic module and the semantic module interact with each other in L2 grammar when mapping linguistic knowledge onto surface forms. The thesis also explores the effect of metalinguistic knowledge on L2 learners&#8217; grammaticality judgments in order to demonstrate a more comprehensive picture of article systems in interlanguage grammar.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English articles, definiteness, count/mass distinctions, interlanguage grammar, metalinguistic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178731</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining the Bugfolk: Insects and Anthropomorphism in Popular Culture</field><field name="creator">Adam Dodd</field><field name="description">Anthropomorphic portrayals of insects in popular culture reflect ongoing debates and uncertainties about the nature of human beings and their place within the environment. This thesis examines anthropomorphic portrayals of insects in popular media from the early nineteenth century to the present day. It shows how the codes of anthropomorphic representation that developed in conjunction with popular microscopy during the nineteenth century have continued to shape the portrayal of insects in popular culture. Nineteenth-century books about insects refined a literary style conducive to the description of settings and events existing outside the normal perceptual parameters of the reader. The popularity and descriptive limits of this style, along with advances in printing methods and photography, led to an increase in production and distribution of insect imagery. The public fascination with insect imagery inspired many cinematic portrayals of insects that, continuing into the twentieth century, advanced the codes of anthropomorphism already established by preceding texts. Central to these anthropomorphic portrayals is the &#8216;otherworldly&#8217; status of the insect, a status ensured by its location in the so-called &#8216;insect world.&#8217; Hence, insects have come to inspire a range of otherworldly beings, from the nineteenth-century fairy to contemporary representations of extraterrestrial beings. The popularity of these figures, in turn, has shaped conceptions of insects themselves. Studying these figures provides an opportunity to better understand how human-insect relations are shaped by culture, and thus to interrogate how human identity itself arises from, and is guided by, cultural practices that seek to engage with the natural world. By foregrounding the ways in which the insect has come to represent the otherworldly and the imaginal, it becomes possible to begin to alleviate psychological barriers to ecological realities, and in particular, the ecological reality of the insect&#8217;s place as the most biologically prolific species on Earth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insects, anthropomorphism, popular culture, visual media, entomology, microscopy, cinema, aliens, fairies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178733</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why employees work extended working hours: A discourse study</field><field name="creator">Neal Waddell</field><field name="description">The expectation that employees of large organisations will work extended working hours (EWH) is a phenomenon of discourse at the societal and organisational levels. This occurs in spite of the detrimental effects that working long hours can have on employees&#8217; mental and physical health and the well-being of their families. This thesis investigates why employees comply with this expectation by focussing on managers and professionals because they are the categories of Australian employees who work the longest hours. Texts derived from a focus group and extended interviews of 30 managers and professionals are analysed and interpreted using a computer-assisted text analysis program, linguistic analysis, and discourse linguistic interpretation. Of particular emphasis is the deontic modality that research participants use to express their obligation to expectation and their attitudes about other organisational imperatives. Also crucial to this research is the agency of the participants in terms of their capacity to make and follow their own decisions. This investigation is informed by critical post-structuralist theory of Foucaultian origin involving a pragmatic distinction between analysis for meaning potential at the text level and context for meaning at the discourse level. This empirical research found that participants commonly feel cognitive dissonance from the contradiction that EWH and work-life balance (WLB) co-exist in their same organisational discourse. This paradox complicates their responses to expectation whether the participants comply or resist. Participants&#8217; agency is therefore judged on their level of reflexivity to these organisational challenges. The professional cohort was found to be more reflexive and thus agentically stronger because their work paths are clearer. They know what work is required and, even though their working hours may be long, they see them purely as the means to achieving prescribed ends. Public sector managers&#8217; work is also extensive but they do not have clear boundaries and thus find the boundaries between work and nonwork non-existent or blurred. Financial service managers are more agentic than public sector managers but less than the professionals. The women in this research relate to work time and life balance differently and less easily than men, particularly those who break for motherhood and / or work part-time. The theory built in this thesis can inform organisations of the ubiquitous presence of the expectation of EWH and the dangers it provides for employees and organisations. It also provides practice guidance to organisations as to how EWH may be common but do not necessarily benefit organisations or their employees. This thesis finds that it is more sensible to support employees&#8217; agency by acknowledging their diversity and giving them choice in determining for how long they should work. This would allow employees to identify and experience obligation to their organisation and their part in negotiated knowledge production.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">extended working hours, discourse, expectation, obligation, work-life balance, agency, Leximancer, qualitative research, managers, professionals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178792</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Galaxy Morphology &amp; Star Formation in the Supercluster Environment</field><field name="creator">Jason A. Moore</field><field name="description">In this thesis we provide a better understanding of the role of the inter-cluster filamentary environment in the evolution of galaxy properties, relating that to the physical mechanisms involved. We examine a poorer supercluster structure and describe how it compares with the richer regime, deciding whether the same processes are responsible for driving galaxy evolution in both cases. We develop a new approach to automated galaxy morphology classification, undertake an extensive observational survey of a nearby supercluster and investigate the evolution of galaxy properties within this structure, considering the filamentary environments that we confirm exist. Firstly, we present an application of Mathematical Morphology (MM) for the classification of astronomical objects, both for star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morphology classification. We demonstrate that, for CCD images, 99.3 &#177; 3.8% of galaxies can be separated from stars using MM, with 19.4&#177;7.9% of the stars being misclassified. We demonstrate that, for photographic plate images, the number of galaxies correctly separated from the stars can be increased using our MM diffraction spike tool, which allows 51.0&#177;6.0% of the high-brightness galaxies that are inseparable in current techniques to be correctly classified, with only 1.4 &#177; 0.5% of the high-brightness stars contaminating the population. We demonstrate that elliptical (E) and late-type spiral (Sc-Sd) galaxies can be classified using MM at an accuracy of 91.4 &#177; 7.8%. It is a method involving less &#8216;free parameters&#8217; than current techniques, especially automated machine learning algorithms. The limitations of MM due to seeing and distance are also discussed. We examine various star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morhpology classification techniques commonly used today, and show that the above MM techniques compare very favourably. Secondly, we present a wide-field photometric and spectroscopic study of the supercluster SCL266 (z = 0.068). We have obtained CCD imaging in B-, R- and I-bands covering 5 clusters within the structure, and spectroscopy within the region of 3 of the clusters and the filamentary environment between them. We have over 950 redshifts obtained and 161 galaxies confirmed as members of the supercluster structure. The galaxy morphologies are derived using the MM techniques we have developed. We show that the population of passive, early-type galaxies extends into the dense regions of the filaments and is not just confined to the higher-density clusters, indicating that the denser filamentary environment hastens the galaxy evolution within it. The star-forming, late-type galaxies are distributed throughout the entirety of the supercluster structure. We show that both the mean star formation rate and the fraction of star-forming galaxies decrease strongly as a function of distance along the filaments towards the cluster centres. Given these observations we conclude that the evolution occurring within this poor supercluster begins within the filaments up to 4 Mpc away from the cluster centres, and is driven by long time-scale mechanisms involving encounters between neighbouring galaxies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178863</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ambushers or Sponsors? An Examination of Sponsorship Linked Advertising.</field><field name="creator">Sarah Kelly</field><field name="description">This research proposes that a construct called Sponsorship Linked Advertising (SLA) is valuable in understanding how brand and corporate advertising link to sponsorship and event marketing. SLA includes both ads that communicate a link to a sponsored event (tiedness) and those that demonstrate, through their overall design, an event&#8217;s motif or theme (themedness). In its themed form, SLA differs from creative advertising by virtue of the fact that creative advertising can exist independent of any sponsorship link, whereas sponsorship linked advertisements intentionally unite a sponsorship and an event either implicitly and/or explicitly. With sponsorship investment estimated to be $45.2 billion worldwide (International Events Group 2009) and leverage advertising (i.e., advertising that is employed to heighten awareness of sponsorships or better articulate sponsor-event links) reflecting a similar amount, empirical examination, validation and implementation guidance of SLA as a leveraging strategy is critical. The unique marketing opportunities associated with popular sporting, charitable and arts events also attract non-sponsoring companies which also seek to affiliate with the event, an activity known as ambushing (McKelvey and Grady 2008). Examination of SLA is therefore important in an increasingly competitive and cluttered global sponsorship arena, in which ambushing is becoming a pervasive practice, attracting considerable attention from event organisers, sponsors and policy makers alike, while also detracting from or diluting intended sponsorship communications. Despite widespread use of SLA, no empirical validation of this strategy has been undertaken to date. The present research addresses this gap. Initially, the SLA construct is defined, categorised, and measured through content analysis, then a series of experimental studies are used to achieve empirical validation of the SLA construct. Streams of sponsorship and advertising effectiveness research, along with theories of associative learning, attribution and persuasion, are used to guide examination of SLA effectiveness in new empirical work. Specifically, a series of experiments are used to examine consumers&#8217; cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to SLA. The first experimental study tests a main effect of ad type as well as interactive effects of tiedness and themedness with sponsorship availability (i.e., knowledge of true sponsor) on outcomes including nature and type of thoughts elicited, ad scepticism and sponsor motive attributions. Findings from this study suggest that SLA exposure induces more positive thoughts, less ad scepticism and more favourable attributions than exposure to Non SLA. These results provide initial evidence that consumers process SLA differently to other ad types and interestingly, may derive enjoyment from, or at least exhibit less ad scepticism towards viewing SLA. Finally, the influence of competitive context on sponsor recall is tested by simulating exposure to ambush and/or SLA ad types following a sponsorship announcement. Findings provide evidence to support a memory interference hypothesis and imply that accuracy of sponsor recall is diminished by presence of an ambush ad, but that this effect is moderated by presence of SLA leveraging a previously announced sponsorship. Taken together, the results of this series of studies provide an empirical measurement of SLA strategy and demonstrate construct validity. Further, interpretation of the results gives rise to specific creative strategies for practical implementation. Ecological validity is built into the design by using real events within ad stimuli and investigating SLA in the competitive context in which it occurs. Hence, the results are said to be generalisable to real-world situations, and the resultant creative strategies are arguably contextually valid. This research contributes to existing marketing and sponsorship literature by proposing and empirically validating a new construct. Theoretically, it examines consumer response to SLA by combining information processing and resistance based perspectives. It extends traditional views of ambushing by offering empirical evidence of the practice being widespread and extending to low level sponsors and event &#8220;free riders&#8221;. Practical implications of this research extend to advertisers and sponsors faced with the challenge of effectively leveraging huge sponsorship investments and assessing return on such investment. Empirical testing of ambushing effects has important implications for the debate on increased regulatory intervention of such practices, a debate centred upon tension between balancing fair marketing practice with the rights of sponsors and event organisers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Marketing, Advertising, Sponsorship, Ambushing, Content analysis, Experimental Method, Consumer skepticism, Memory interference.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178925</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iron Chelators in the Treatment of Cancer</field><field name="creator">Mohammad Islam</field><field name="description">Iron is the most abundant trace mineral in the body and an essential element in all living systems. In humans, iron is found at the active site of a number of key proteins involved in oxygen transport, metabolism, respiration and DNA synthesis. The development of agents that inhibit the iron dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is an established strategy in cancer therapy. Hydroxyurea is the first agent to target RR by inactivating the nonheme iron centre, but its efficacy appears to be limited to myeloproliferative disorders. Currently, Triapine&#8482; (3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone) is a successful iron chelator, which inhibits enzyme activity and cell growth in vitro at 100 to 1000 fold lower concentrations than hydroxyurea. Preclinical studies suggested that Triapine&#8482; may be an attractive agent to move into clinical development in patients with cancer. Therefore, heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones as well as their iron complexes are an important series of compounds, which may show promising anticancer properties. Thiosemicarbazone derivatives of the HDpT (di-2-pyridyl ketone-3-thiosemicarbazone), HBpT (2-benzoylpyridine-3-thiosemicarbazone), HNBpT (2-(3&#900;-nitrobenzoyl)pyridine-3-thiosemicarbazone) and HApT (2-acetylpyridine-3-thiosemicarbazone) series and their FeII and FeIII complexes were synthesised and characterised by elemental analyses, UV-vis spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, IR (ATR, attenuated total reflectance), EPR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and X-ray crystallography. To further understand their physical and chemical properties, other transition metal Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn complexes of the HDpT and HBpT analogues were synthesised and characterised. The X-ray crystal structure of trivalent Fe complexes and divalent (Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn) complexes were determined. The HDpT, HBpT, HNBpT and HApT analogues of thiosemicarbazone class of iron chelators have the capability to bind metal ions as tridentate (N,N,S) ligands, forming 2:1 ligand:Fe complexes with an N4S2 octahedral coordination sphere. During the course of investigation, the formation constants of MnII, NiII, CuII and ZnII complexes of these series were determined by spectrophotometric competition titration with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). Several interesting aspects of the coordination chemistry of these iron chelators have also been discovered To better understand the biological activities of these ligands, the chemical and the physical properties of these ligands and their iron and other transition metal complexes have been studied. Chiefly, we are concerned with their ability to cross the cell membrane (lipophilicity) as well as the redox chemistry of their metal complexes. The lipophilicity of the ligands was determined by direct partitioning between 1-octanol and water at pH 7.4. The Fe complexes of the HApT series exhibit lower redox potentials than their corresponding HDpT, HBpT and HNBpT complexes and higher anticancer activity indicating a link between their Fe redox reactivity and their biological properties.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Thiosemicarbazones</field><field name="subject">Chelators</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179025</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justice or Judgement? The Criminal Justice System and Women&#8217;s, Police Officers&#8217;, Support Workers&#8217;, and Potential Jurors&#8217; Perspectives on Rape</field><field name="creator">King, Rachel</field><field name="description">This thesis provides strong, triangulated evidence to suggest that despite many reforms to legislation, policy and training, in an Australian context, there has been limited improvement in the manner by which police officers respond to complaints of rape and treat women who have experienced rape. My research provides insight into a police organisation that is rarely open to scrutiny, and shows that when a woman reports a rape to police, she is less likely to be believed if, for example, she has been raped by someone familiar to her, or if she has demonstrated non-consent in an acquiescent manner. It is within this climate that I conducted my research to gain the perceptions of women who have experienced rape regarding the criminal justice response to rape, the perceptions of support workers from Centres Against Sexual Assault (CASAs) on the criminal justice response to rape, police officers&#8217; perceptions of the manner in which rape is dealt with by police, and the perceptions of potential jurors regarding rape. This research therefore examines the factors which influenced which rape cases were investigated by police and referred to prosecution by police, and the manner in which police decisions were made, based on non legal factors such as stereotypes, myths, individual and collective factors. This thesis comprises four separate but complementary studies and combines quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Study 1 investigated the perceptions of women (N=6) who have experienced rape regarding the police response to rape in semi-structured in depth interviews. Analysis of this data suggested police officers&#8217; treatment and decisions regarding these women&#8217;s experiences were determined by the relationship between the woman and the perpetrator, and by rape myths regarding &#8216;real rapes&#8217; and &#8216;genuine victims&#8217;. Through focus groups (N=4) with support workers from Centres Against Sexual Assault (CASAs) Study 2 examined the perceptions of these workers regarding the manner by which rape myths and gender stereotypes influenced police officers&#8217; treatment and decisions regarding complaints of rape made by women. In support of the women&#8217;s perceptions from Study 1, this data indicated CASA workers believed that police officers&#8217; responses are heavily imbued with stereotypes and myths regarding appropriate behaviours for women, and those associated with mental illness and ethnicity. The data obtained in Study 3 elucidated a more detailed understanding of the influence of rape myths and gender stereotypes on the police response to rape. In semi-structured in depth interviews (N=14) police officers identified factors such as alcohol use, mental illness, the effect of potential jurors&#8217; perceptions regarding a woman, and the relationship between the woman and the perpetrator as influencing their decision making. Police officers also described the manner by which they use these stereotypes to arrive at a &#8216;hunch&#8217;, using intuition to determine the credibility of a woman who reports rape. Through surveys, Study 4 investigated the influence of rape myths and gender stereotypes on potential jurors (N=161) perceptions of what constitutes rape, and provided some insight regarding the attitudes police officers may consider when determining the &#8216;convictability&#8217; of a rape complaint. The data from Study 4 indicated that potential jurors are less likely to define a scenario as rape when the familiarity between the woman and the perpetrator increased, when the woman had been drinking alcohol and when the woman demonstrated her non-consent in an acquiescent manner. Of critical importance, interviews with police officers indicated they use considerable discretion to act on their hunches and intuition to arrive at decisions regarding the woman&#8217;s credibility based on rape myths and gender stereotypes. The triangulation of findings from women&#8217;s, CASA support workers&#8217;, and from police officers, suggest women who report rape to police are going to be judged by interpretations of the legal definitions of what constitutes rape that are imbued with rape myths and gender stereotypes. My findings illustrate the importance of seeking methods that will improve the substantial under reporting of rape. My findings also demonstrate that if women do have their cases proceed to court, they are likely to be subjected to considerable disbelief as a consequence of prejudicial attitudes within jurors, which are similar to those of police. In response to these findings, suggestions for improvements are recommended, such as specialist rape courts and evaluations of the content of police training. Ultimately, this research illustrates that in 2009 in Australia, women who report rape are subject to considerable uncertainty regarding whether they will receive justice or judgement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">rape</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">criminal justice system</field><field name="subject">victims/survivors</field><field name="subject">Centres Against Sexual Assault</field><field name="subject">legislation</field><field name="subject">potential jurors</field><field name="subject">empowerment methodology</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179034</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of Botrytis cinerea infecting waxflower (Chamelaucium) flowers and potential elicitation of host defence in this pathosystem</field><field name="creator">Son-Quang Dinh</field><field name="description">Waxflower (Chamelaucium spp. and hybrids) is the singlemost important Australian export cut-flower. The major problem in waxflower trading is flower abscission after harvest. While several factors are involved, ethylene production resulting from preharvest infection with the fungus Botrytis cinerea is the most important cause. The general objectives of this study were to investigate the biology of Botrytis infecting waxflower flowers and potential elicitation of host defence against this pathogen. Effects of anti-ethylene and S-carvone treatments on Botrytis-induced flower abscission were also evaluated. Infection of flowers by Botrytis was studied on two waxflower cvs. Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen using light and electron microscopy. Conidial germination and protoappressorial formation occurred within 8 h post-inoculation (hpi). Infection of most floral organs, including petals, anthers and filaments, stigma, and hypanthium, was within 24 hpi. Infection cushions on stamen bases were formed at 36 hpi by saprophytic hyphae that originated from anthers. This infection route probably gives rise to the typical tan-coloured Botrytis symptoms that appear to radiate from this part of the flower. Subcuticular hyphae were present at very high density near stamen bases. They evidently resulted at multiple penetrations from single infection cushions. Flower abscission occurred at 72 hpi. At this time, floral tube tissues remained uninfected. This temporal pattern infers the possible transmission of a signal (e.g. ethylene) upon Botrytis infection (6&#8211;36 hpi) that intiates a defence response of shedding infected flowers (72 hpi). Susceptibility of waxflower before and after harvest to B. cinerea under various environmental conditions (laboratory, greenhouse, and field) was investigated. Flowers, either on plants or on cut stems showed similar susceptibility to B. cinerea and abscised under cool temperatures (~20 &#186;C) and high humidity (&gt;95% RH) conditions following infection. Compared to cv. Mullering Brook, cv. My Sweet Sixteen was somewhat more resistant to B. cinerea infection under field conditions. Constitutive and inducible antifungal compounds in waxflower flower tissues were screened in cvs. CWA Pink, Stephan&#8217;s Delight, Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen using thin layer chromatography bioassays with isolates of B. cinerea and Alternaria alternata (pathogenic) and Cladosporium cladosporioides (non-pathogenic). Common inhibition zone observed at Rf 0.28&#8211;0.38, 0.46&#8211;0.56 and 0.67&#8211;0.76 contained phenolic compounds. There were at least five (cv. Mullering Brook) and one (cv. My Sweet Sixteen) inducible antifungal phenolic compounds as judged by increases in inhibition area as a result of B. cinerea infection and methyl jasmonate treatment. The total areas of B. cinerea- and MeJA-induced inhibition zones were approximately 2.0- and 2.5-folds greater, respectively, than zones from control flowers. Preharvest sprays of three different known host plant defence elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), and silicon (Si), were applied to waxflower cvs. Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen plants. BTH or Si sprays generally had no significant effect on postharvest Botrytis severity on either cultivar. MeJA sprays did not reduce B. cinerea on cv. Mullering Brook. MeJA slightly suppressed B. cinerea on cv. My Sweet Sixteen at 500 and 750 &#181;M. Overall, field applications of these host plant defence elicitor chemicals as spray treatments had little effect on vase life, water uptake and relative fresh weight of the cut sprigs. Moreover, they did not appreciably suppress B. cinerea or associated postharvest floral abscission. The efficacy of combined elicitor treatments and combined pre- and postharvest MeJA treatments were assessed. Preharvest foliar applications of MeJA (1000 &#181;M; 2 or 4 times), MeJA (1000 &#181;M) combined with BTH (150 mg/L), and MeJA combined with Si (1500 mg SiO2/L) generally did not suppress postharvest B. cinerea development and flower abscission from harvested sprigs. A pre- plus post-harvest 1000 &#181;M MeJA spray treatment consistently but only slightly suppressed B. cinerea infection on flowers from both pot- and field-grown plants. Pre- and post-harvest MeJA treatments reduced B. cinerea development, but increased flower abscission. Combined MeJA and anti-ethylene treatments were then screened for potential to suppress B. cinerea while preventing flower abscission. However, the combined MeJA and 1-MCP treatment reduced neither Botrytis disease nor flower abscission on sprigs from pot- and field-grown plants. The combined MeJA and STS treatment reduced disease severity for up to 6 days on sprigs harvested from pot-grown plants but tended to increase Botrytis severity on sprigs from field-grown plants 6 days after inoculation. Antifungal effects of the essential oil S-carvone against B. cinerea germination and mycelial growth were demonstrated in vitro. Inhibition increased with increasing S-carvone concentrations from 0.64 mM to 5.08 mM.

The field of &#8216;systematic conservation planning&#8217; is concerned with identifying cost-effective places and actions to protect biological diversity. Past research has focused on static assessments. However, given the fact that biological diversity and processes that threaten its persistence vary in space and time, conservation assessments might need to be made in a dynamic context. In addition, we must explicitly account for the trade-offs associated with implementing conservation actions and investing in improved knowledge and learning to reduce uncertainty on where, how and when to act. The aim of this thesis was to develop novel approaches for accounting for both ecosystem dynamics and uncertainty in conservation planning. Ecosystems are generally treated as static in conservation planning despite many being spatially and temporally dynamic. For example, pelagic marine ecosystems are quite dynamic because ecological processes, such as eddies, that produce resources that many species depend on can be erratic. In chapter two we explored the issue of developing a system of fixed protected areas that consider the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm. The approach was to maximize the representation of key fisheries species and species of conservation concern due to significant declines in their abundance, within a network of protected areas. We also ensured that protected area design reflected system dynamics and this was achieved by representing key oceanographic process (such as upwellings and eddies), and biological processes (such as the abundance of small pelagic fish) in protected areas. To account for the variability where these processes occur, we used time series data to find both predictable areas and anomalies, assuming that their past location was somewhat reflective of their future locations. Implementing conservation actions that are fixed in space and time are probably not the most effective strategy in ecosystems that are dynamic. This is because of the movements of particular species. For example, many species have distributions and abundances that change seasonally and might only require temporary management in particular areas. In chapter three, we tested the utility of three approaches to implementing fisheries closures to reduce bycatch in the South African Longline Fishery; 1) time closures, 2) permanent spatial closures and 3) episodic spatial closures. In chapter three, we identified these closures using an existing database containing catch and bycatch data from 1998 to 2005. There was variation where and when different species were caught as bycatch, and it was determined seasonal area closures were the best strategy. This was because it achieved the same conservation objectives for bycatch species as the other types of closures, but impacted less on the long-lining industry. While this result is intuitive, it demonstrated quantitatively, how much more effective moveable management can be. Decisions on where conservation actions are implemented are always based on incomplete knowledge about biological diversity. It is generally assumed that gathering more data is a good investment for conservation planning. However, data can take time and incur costs to collect and given habitat loss, there are both costs and benefits associated with different levels of investments in knowledge versus conservation implementation. In chapter four, the aim was to determine the return on investment from spending different amounts on survey data before undertaking a program of implementing new protected areas. We found that, after an investment of only US$100,000, there was little increase in the effectiveness of conservation actions, despite the full species dataset costing at least 25 times that amount. Surveying can take time because of expertise limitations, logistics and funding shortfalls. Biological diversity may be lost while data collection occurs conversely, not collecting enough data can lead to erroneous decisions. Additionally, resources spent on learning may be better spent on other actions. In chapter five, in a series of retrospective simulations, we compared the impact of spending different amounts of time collecting biological data prior to the implementation of new protected areas. The aim was to find the optimal survey period given the trade-off between gaining knowledge to improve conservation decisions while there is concurrent loss of habitat. We discovered that surveying beyond two years rarely increased the effectiveness of conservation decisions, despite a substantial increase in the knowledge of species distributions. Often there are choices between different actions and uncertainty as to which are the most effective. In chapter six, we discuss how the principles of adaptive management might be applied to conservation planning. Improving future management decisions through learning should be viewed as essential in all conservation plans but such learning is often included as a minor step, or is completely ignored. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of an adaptive framework for conservation planning and ideas for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Systematic conservation planning</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="subject">biodiversity surrogate</field><field name="subject">marine protected areas</field><field name="subject">Protea Atlas</field><field name="subject">Southern Benguela</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179193</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Information and Quantum Computation with Continuous Variables</field><field name="creator">Christian Weedbrook</field><field name="description">The idea to assimilate classical information theory with quantum mechanics resulted in the creation of a new field in physics known as quantum information. One of the first papers in this new field occurred in the early 1970's when Stephen Wiesner wrote the seminal manuscript titled: "Conjugate Coding". However, its importance wasn't imme- diately recognized and wasn't published until 1983. The 1980's and 1990's saw a number of important papers published in quantum information leading to the subfields of quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, quantum entanglement, distinguishability of quantum states, and quantum cloning. It was also during the 1980's, that a new model of computing, known as quantum computation, was beginning to emerge. It offered the possibility of solving certain problems faster than a classical computer by exploiting various properties of quantum mechanics. Research in this field was undoubtedly stimulated by a well known talk given by Richard Feynman in 1981 at MIT on quantum simulations. Both quantum information and quantum computation were initially developed with quantum discrete variables in mind. However, over the course of the last decade, there has been a significant increase in using quantum continuous variables. This thesis will focus on the topic of quantum information and quantum computation using continuous variables. Specifically, we will theoretically consider the cloning of continuous-variable entanglement, the distinguishability of Gaussian states, new continuous-variable quantum cryptography protocols and finally, the universality of quantum computation using continuous-variable cluster states.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Continuous variables, quantum information, quantum computation, quantum cloning, quantum cryptography, distinguishability, quantum entanglement.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179268</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defeat and Failure in Livy: Livy&#8217;s Presentation of Several Prominent Romans and the Roles They Played in his History of the Second Punic War.</field><field name="creator">Paula Marguerite Johnson</field><field name="description">The Second Punic War, fought between the Romans and Carthaginians, lasted for seventeen years. During this time the Carthaginians inflicted several devastating defeats upon Roman armies. In addition to the cost in human lives, these defeats left a legacy of shame which the Romans were anxious to extirpate. An important part of this process lay in the public perception of these events, and the ones most responsible for shaping this perception were the historians who recorded and wrote about them. Historiography in Rome was in its infancy as the Second Punic War drew to an end, and none of the accounts written by men who lived through the war have survived intact. The fullest and most detailed account of these years is that of Livy who, writing two centuries later, inherited the fruits of two centuries of historiography on the subject. Yet contrary to the belief that has persisted too long, Livy was not merely a collator and copyist, but a moralist and an artist with a vision of his own. For Livy, the period of the Second Punic War represents the Romans at their greatest, before the evils of foreign immorality and luxury took root and led eventually to the excessive greed and intense rivalry which tore the state apart. Thus it is not only patriotism, but also nostalgia, that colours Livy&#8217;s memorable presentation of these events and the people involved. Nobody denies Livy&#8217;s literary artistry, but it is the choices he has made in his interpretation of people and events that are of more interest to me. It was Livy&#8217;s cherished belief that the Romans of old, exemplars of courage and strict morality, were well nigh unbeatable in a fair fight, which makes the presentation of episodes of defeat and disgrace so much more challenging for him. A close examination of the ancient evidence, and in some cases a re-evaluation of modern perceptions concerning episodes of defeat and disgrace and the people involved, has allowed me to better grasp the extent of Livy&#8217;s artistic licence and reinterpretation. The evidence and opinions of Polybius have played a crucial role in this process, not only because of his closer proximity to the events in question, but because Livy is known to have read and used his work. Polybius&#8217; influence on Livy&#8217;s later decades concerning Rome&#8217;s involvement with Greek states is undeniable, but although Polybius wrote about the Second Punic War also, Livy has remained remarkably independent of Polybius&#8217; account. A comparison of these accounts reveals the difference in the choices made by each author and serves to illuminate what makes Livy&#8217;s history his own.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Trebia, Trasimene, Cannae, Scipio, Marcellus, Fabius Maximus, Varro, Flaminius, Minucius, Livy, Polybius, Plutarch.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addiction Neuroethics: The Promises and Perils of Neuroscience Research on Addiction</field><field name="creator">Adrian Carter</field><field name="description">Drug addiction is a significant problem facing most societies. It is associated with increased violence, crime and mental illness, and is one of the leading causes of preventable mortality and disability in most developed societies, accounting for over 12% of the total burden of disease (Begg et al., 2007). Neuroscience promises to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of addictive drug use, and the harm that it causes, by providing more effective and better targeted treatment of addiction (Volkow and Li, 2005). Proponents argue that an increased understanding of the neurobiological basis of drug addiction will also lend support for more humane social policies. These policies will recognise that addiction is a neuropsychiatric condition that should be treated therapeutically, leading to increased investment in addiction research and treatment (Dackis and O'Brien, 2005; McLellan et al., 2000). Optimism about the benefits of an understanding of the neurobiological basis of addiction needs to be tempered by more critical considerations. Overly simplistic interpretations of what this kind of approach reveals about addiction could result in less welcome consequences, especially if inappropriate use is made of emerging neurotechnologies, such as coerced use of naltrexone implants, population-wide vaccination programs against addiction, or the promotion of heroic &#8216;cures&#8217; for addiction, such as neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation. This thesis examines both the potentially welcome and unwelcome uses of neurobiological research of addiction with the aims of maximising the benefits, while minimizing any unanticipated harms. I refer to this as Addiction Neuroethics. The primary aims are to examine: (1) the impact that neuroscience research may have upon our understanding of autonomy and self-control in addicted individuals, (2) the implications this understanding may have for how we treat individuals with an addiction; and (3) the conditions under which it would be ethically acceptable to use various technologies emerging from this research. This thesis falls into three parts. First, a concise and accessible summary of the key findings of recent genetic and neuroscience research of addiction is provided. This includes the neuroanatomy of addiction (e.g. the mesolimbic reward pathway), the molecular and cellular biology of addiction, neurocognitive changes, and the role of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities. The second part of this thesis explores how neuroscience research may influence the way that modern societies think about drug use and addiction, and deal with those that suffer from it. This section addresses the central question: do addicted persons have the capacity to make autonomous decisions regarding their own drug use? This raises a number of additional questions. How much responsibility and blame should we attribute to addicted individual&#8217;s for their actions? How should society deal with addicted persons, or respond to the harm that they cause? Should society coerce addicted individuals into treatment, and if so, under what conditions? The third part of this thesis examines the ethical issues raised by the use of powerful new technologies that are emerging from neurobiological research on addiction, such as novel psychopharmacologies, depot implants, drug vaccines, neurosurgery and brain stimulation, neuroimaging and genetic testing. The report also considers the more speculative possibility that addiction neurobiology may improve our ability to prevent the development of addiction, for example, by using genetic screening to identify individuals at high risk of addiction and &#8216;drug vaccines&#8217; to prevent these individuals from becoming addicted. This thesis demonstrates that the chronic use of addictive drugs has significant impacts upon key decision-making regions of the brain (e.g. motivation, memory, impulse inhibition) that affect addicted individuals ability to choose not to use drugs. While the autonomy of addicted individuals is impaired in certain situations, and to varying degrees, it is not extinguished. Rather than deny autonomy, we should aim to engage addicted individuals in ways that increase their autonomy. For example, coerced treatment of addiction may be a valid approach to getting addicted individuals in treatment. However we should avoid overriding the autonomy of addicted individuals by offering treatment as an alternative to punishment for some crimes (e.g. theft to fund drug habit). Such treatment should aim to treat a medical condition, and not be a form of extrajudicial punishment. Addiction is a highly stigmatised condition. This can significantly impact upon the way in which neuroscience research is understood and applied. Scientists, clinicians and policy makers must be mindful of over-enthusiastic applications of novel technologies that may be prematurely embraced and promoted to a desperate and vulnerable population without proper evaluation of the risks, or without considering how these technologies may be used once approved. The treatment of addiction should be judged by its efficacy and safety, as for any other medical treatment. Addicted individuals should be treated as any other individual suffering from a medical condition. The thesis concludes with some general suggestions about the directions in which this debate is likely to develop and identifies areas that will require further analysis and empirical investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">addiction</field><field name="subject">neuroethics</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">consent</field><field name="subject">coercion</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Somatic embryogenesis for micropropagation of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.)</field><field name="creator">Irina Antonova</field><field name="description">Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is native to the regions between 20oN and 20oS of the Equator, where it plays a significant socioeconomic role in the local communities. There it is referred to as &#8217;The Tree of Life&#8217;, a eulogistic epithet describing its versatile use - more than 100 edible and non-edible products can be produced from it. Therefore the coconut palm is grown in about 90 tropical countries on more than 10 millions ha of land (Hamon et al., 1999). Although coconut has a high local socioeconomic reputation, its production is experiencing many problems and consequently the area planted with this crop is declining. The conventional breeding approach using seed to replant land is very expensive due to the low production of seed for planting, and even when elite germplasm is available it takes decades to multiply up enough planting material for new areas (Adkins et al., 1999). Hence over the past 40 years research has been directed towards developing a new technique for the micropropagation of coconut using somatic embryogenic approach. Throughout this time however one conclusion is repeatedly made &#8211; coconut is very recalcitrant to somatic embryogenesis. And although the many obstacles to this are slowly being reduced, in order to successfully micropropagate coconut on a large scale bottlenecks in the protocol still exist, and those include inconsistency of the embryogenic response by explanted tissues, poor somatic embryo maturation and germination, low regeneration rate of the new plantlets and long time required to produce plants (1.5 years) (Samosir et al., 1998). These bottlenecks and other problems were researched in the present study with the aim of trying to speed up the efficiency of coconut somatic embryogenesis process. Hence this thesis had the objectives to identify a starting protocol for coconut somatic embryogenesis; to select an appropriate for aim that explant; to optimize the production of embryogenic callus; to increase the rate of initiating coconut somatic embryos; to improve the maturation of somatic embryos and their germination efficiency; and to optimize the regeneration rate of the new plantlets. In order to identify a starting protocol, preliminary work was conducted, where existing protocols for coconut somatic embryogenesis were compared in their efficiency to induce somatic embryos. The protocol that stood out as the best in producing most embryogenic callus and subsequently embryos, as well as having the least dead (in culture) explants, was that of Nikmatullah (2001). Therefore the latter was chosen to be used as a starting protocol for this study. New sources of explants were investigated during the current work as well, using tissues from different parts of in vitro derived 8 months old coconut plantlets. Those however have shown to be unsuitable for somatic embryogenesis, since only non-embryogenic callus was developed by some of the inoculated tissues. The immature inflorescence explants were superior in producing embryogenic callus and somatic embryos; therefore they were selected as the preferred explant source to use in the next steps of the current study. Optimizing the production of embryogenic callus was the first issue to address during the core work of this project. As a result of that the culture conditions were considerably improved by using vessels with larger headspace-medium ratio (3:1), as well as by selecting younger immature inflorescences and transversely segmenting the top half of the inflorescence spikes into smaller size (1 mm) sections. Further improvement was possible by studying the make up of the callus growth media. Amongst the administered for that purpose substances the applied together polyamines spermine (0.10 &#181;M) and putrescine (7.5 mM) have proven to play a notably positive role in the induction of callus from coconut immature inflorescence explants. Thidiazuron (TDZ, 10 &#181;M) too has shown a potential to improve the efficiency of the initial stage of coconut somatic embryogenesis, but only when applied in conjunction with other cytokinins (eg. BAP and 2iP). Smoke-saturated-water (SSW, 10 %) could only slightly diminish the amount of necrotising cultured explants, and high 2,4-D concentrations could not support the induction of callus from immature coconut inflorescences. Collectively taken, as a result of this current study the production of callus was improved by 300 %. The rate of coconut somatic embryos formation was as well significantly increased (over 300 %), by the simultaneous application of suspension culture step, spermine (0.01 &#181;M), SSW (10 %) and high auxin concentration (500 &#181;M). Nevertheless the presence of TDZ and other cytokinins in the medium, as well as the absence of activated charcoal, were found to be unable to positively influence the somatic embryogenesis process. Despite the considerable improvements made in the efficiency of inducing callus and initiating embryos, the poor maturation and germination (eg. 5 %, Verdeil et. al., 1999) of somatic embryos still remained a bottleneck to the whole somatic embryogenesis procedure. Therefore further work was conducted in that direction and discovered that embryo maturation and germination rate can be elevated to 55 % by administering ancymidol (30 &#181;M) to the somatic embryo maturation medium. This plant retardant has exhibited here three potential modes of action towards the cultured coconut somatic embryos: a) as a promoter of somatic embryo maturation and germination; b) as a preventor of pre-germination death of the somatic embryos; and c) as a preserver of non-germinating somatic embryos, that still can possess the potential to germinate in the future. The work during the next step of the process &#8211; regeneration of the new plantlets &#8211; has shown that the omission of plant growth regulators from the media was crucial for the development of germinated embryos into new plantlets, where otherwise no plant regeneration occurred at all. The achieved here plantlet regeneration rate in the PGR-free medim was 56 %, which is higher than the previously reported 20 % regeneration rate (Verdeil et al., 1994) for coconut plantlets produced from immature inflorescences explants. As a result of this current work a new method was developed for somatic embryogenesis of coconut from immature inflorescences explants (Fig. 9.2). The overall efficiency of this protocol is over three times higher than that of the starting protocol (Nikmatullah, 2001) selected during the preliminary work. Furthermore, when using this new method the entire duration for regenerating clonal coconut plantlets (up to the stage of first root and shoot emerging) takes up to 8 months, which is the shortest reported time for producing coconut plantlets via somatic embryogenesis (eg. 36 months from inflorescences explants (Verdeil et. al., 1999) and 18 months from sliced zygotic explants (Samosir, 1999, Fig. 9.2), presenting an additional valuable advantage of this newly developed method, from the perspective of the potential to micropropagate coconut on a commercial scale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coconut, somatic embryogenesis, micropropagation, polyamines, spermine, putrescine, ancymidol, smoke-saturated-water, thidiazuron</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179602</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Third-Party Disability in Spouses of Older People with Hearing Impairment</field><field name="creator">Nerina Scarinci</field><field name="description">Hearing impairment is the most common communication disability in older people. The wide-ranging impact of hearing impairment on communication means that not only does the person with hearing impairment experience the consequences but also his or her frequent communication partners. This thesis investigates the impact of hearing impairment on spouses and uses the World Health Organization&#8217;s term &#8220;third-party disability.&#8221; Third-party disability is defined as the impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions experienced by the family due to the health condition of their significant other, and was identified by the World Health Organization as an area for future development and application of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Despite a number of studies previously published on the effect of hearing impairment on family members, including younger couples and carers, there remain substantial gaps in knowledge and understanding of the difficulties specifically relating to older people and factors associated with third-party hearing disability. This thesis focuses on the third-party disability experienced by normally hearing spouses (termed the &#8220;spouses&#8221; in this thesis) of older people with hearing impairment (termed the &#8220;partners&#8221; in this thesis). To add empirical data to the body of research, this series of studies first explored the lived experience of spouses of older people with hearing impairment in a qualitative study, then identified the ICF domains and categories that described third-party hearing disability, described the extent of third-party hearing disability in this population, modelled the contribution of factors to third-party hearing disability, and developed and psychometrically tested a scale to measure the third-party disability of spouses of older people with hearing impairment. Studies conducted within this thesis were therefore completed in two phases. Ten spouses of older people with hearing impairment participated in the first qualitative phase, consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Results of this study showed that spouses experience a number of effects as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment including: (1) the broad ranging effects of the hearing impairment on the spouses&#8217; everyday lives; (2) the spouses&#8217; need to constantly adapt to their partners&#8217; hearing impairment; (3) the effect of acceptance of the hearing impairment on the spouse; and (4) the impact of ageing and retirement. Findings were then linked to the ICF to identify the most typical and relevant domains and categories of the ICF for spouses of older people with hearing impairment. The majority of themes were able to be linked to the ICF, with most linking to codes in the activities and participation component. A number of contextual factors were also identified that influenced the spouses&#8217; third-party disability. In the second phase, a further 100 older couples affected by hearing impairment participated in a quantitative face-to-face survey to describe the nature and degree of third-party disability in spouses, and to examine factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Concepts identified in the first qualitative study were used to formulate a 36-item tool for measuring spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability, namely the Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability (SOS-HEAR). The majority of spouses in this study (98%) reported some degree of third-party hearing disability on at least one item of the SOS-HEAR. Communication difficulties between the couple were the central source of stress reported by spouses, followed by emotional problems in the spouse. Three factors were found to be significantly associated with greater third-party hearing disability: (1) lower relationship satisfaction as described by spouses; (2) a larger spouse-partner age difference; and (3) greater hearing disability in the hearing impaired partner as perceived by the spouse. The scaling properties of the SOS-HEAR were then examined, with a revised 27-item questionnaire found to be a reliable means of measuring older spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability. Use of the SOS-HEAR is proposed as a means of identifying spouses of older people with hearing impairment in need of intervention. If spouses are identified as experiencing third-party hearing disability, health professionals are then in a position to facilitate discussions with the couple about the impact of the hearing loss on their daily functioning. The inclusion of spouses in rehabilitation takes into account the needs of both members of the couple such that they become partners in rehabilitation. In summary, this research has shown that hearing impairment in older people has an effect on the spouse, as they too experience situations of communication activity limitations and participation restrictions. It is clear that the lives of participants in this study were considerably affected as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment, with spouses reporting a wide variety of stresses involving lifestyle changes, communication difficulties, and emotional consequences. This series of studies has highlighted the potentially important role of family-centred intervention in rehabilitation for older adults with hearing impairment, and strongly suggests the need for increased inclusion of spouses and significant others in the rehabilitation process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">third-party disability</field><field name="subject">hearing impairment</field><field name="subject">ICF</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">spouses</field><field name="subject">significant others</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">psychosocial factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179594</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Control of Finite Dimensional Quantum Systems</field><field name="creator">Paulo Marques Furtado de Mendonca</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of developing a quantum counter-part of the well established classical theory of control. We dwell on the fundamental fact that quantum states are generally not perfectly distinguishable, and quantum measurements typically introduce noise in the system being measured. Because of these, it is generally not clear whether the central concept of the classical control theory --- that of observing the system and then applying feedback --- is always useful in the quantum setting. We center our investigations around the problem of transforming the state of a quantum system into a given target state, when the system can be prepared in different ways, and the target state depends on the choice of preparation. We call this the "quantum tracking problem" and show how it can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be approached both numerically and analytically. This problem provides a simple route to the characterization of the quantum trade-off between information gain and disturbance, and is seen to have several applications in quantum information. In order to characterize the optimality of our tracking procedures, some figure-of-merit has to be specified. Naturally, distance measures for quantum states are the ideal candidates for this purpose. We investigated several possibilities, and found that there is usually a compromise between physically motivated and mathematically tractable measures. We also introduce an alternative to the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity for mixed quantum states, which besides reproducing a number of properties of the standard fidelity, is especially attractive because it is simpler to compute. We employ some ideas of convex analysis to construct optimal control schemes analytically. In particular, we obtain analytic forms of optimal controllers for stabilizing and tracking any pair of states of a single-qubit. In the case of stabilization, we find that feedback control is always useful, but because of the trade-off between information gain and disturbance, somewhat different from the type of feedback performed in classical systems. In the case of tracking, we find that feedback is not always useful, meaning that depending on the choice of states one wants to achieve, it may be better not to introduce any noise by the application of quantum measurements. We also demonstrate that our optimal controllers are immediately applicable in several quantum information applications such as state-dependent cloning, purification, stabilization, and discrimination. In all of these cases, we were able to recover and extend previously known optimal strategies and performances. Finally we show how optimal single-step control schemes can be concatenated to provide multi-step strategies that usually over-perform optimal control protocols based on a single interaction between the controller and the system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum control</field><field name="subject">state transformation</field><field name="subject">quantum channels</field><field name="subject">distance measures</field><field name="subject">semidefinite programming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179753</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermalisation, correlations and entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates</field><field name="creator">Andrew James Ferris</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates thermalisation, correlations and entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates. Bose-Einstein condensates are ultra-cold collections of identical bosonic atoms which accumulate in a single quantum state, forming a mesoscopic quantum object. They are clean and controllable quantum many-body systems that permit an unprecedented degree of experimental flexibility compared to other physical systems. Further, a tractable microscopic theory exists which allows a direct and powerful comparison between theory and experiment, propelling the field of quantum atom optics forward at an incredible pace. Here we explore some of the fundamental frontiers of the field, examining how non-classical correlations and entanglement can be created and measured, as well as how non-classical effects can lead to the rapid heating of atom clouds. We first investigate correlations between two weakly coupled condensates, a system analogous to a superconducting Josephson junction. The ground state of this system contains non-classical number correlation arising from the repulsion between the atoms. Such states are of interest because they may lead to more precise measurement devices such as atomic gyroscopes. Unfortunately thermal fluctuations can destroy these correlations, and great care is needed to experimentally observe non-classical effects. We show that adiabatic evolution can drive the isolated quantum system out of thermal equilibrium and decrease thermal noise, in agreement with a recent experiment [Esteve et al. Nature 455, 1216 (2008)]. This technique may be valuable for observing and using quantum correlated states in the future. Next, we analyse the rapid heating that occurs when a condensate is placed in a moving periodic potential. The dynamical instability responsible for the heating was the subject of much uncertainty, which we suggest was due to the inability of the mean-field approximation to account for important spontaneous scattering processes. We show that a model including non-classical spontaneous scattering can describe dynamical instabilities correctly in each of the regimes where they have been observed, and in particular we compare our simulations to an experiment performed at the University of Otago deep inside the spontaneous scattering regime. Finally, we proposed a method to create and detect entangled atomic wave-packets. Entangled atoms are interesting from a fundamental perspective, and may prove useful in future quantum information and precision measurement technologies. Entanglement is generated by interactions, such as atomic collisions in Bose-Einstein condensates. We analyse the type of entanglement generated via atomic collisions and introduce an abstract scheme for detecting entanglement and demonstrating the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox with ultra-cold atoms. We further this result by proposing an experiment where entangled wave-packets are created and detected. The entanglement is generated by the pairwise scattering that causes the instabilities in moving periodic potentials mentioned above. By careful arrangement, the instability process can be controlled to to produce two well-defined atomic wave-packets. The presence of entanglement can be proven by applying a series of laser pulses to interfere the wave-packets and then measuring the output populations. Realising this experiment is feasible with current technology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensate</field><field name="subject">quantum mechanics</field><field name="subject">thermalisation</field><field name="subject">entanglement</field><field name="subject">ultracold atoms</field><field name="subject">correlations</field><field name="subject">squeezing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179732</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the relationships between stress, coping, benefit-finding and Quality of Life in Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A longitudinal study.</field><field name="creator">Machelle Rinaldis</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to conduct a longitudinal study, to investigate the quality of life (QOL) in a large sample of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), immediately post-diagnosis and one-year later. Various measures were utilised to capture the multifaceted concept of QOL, including psychological distress, satisfaction with life, positive affect and cancer-related quality of life. The investigation was conducted within Lazarus and Folkman&#8217;s stress and coping framework. Specifically, this research aimed to test the utility of the stress and coping framework in the context of CRC, and to explore the role of benefit-finding within the context of the stress and coping model components. One thousand, eight hundred participants (1078 men and 722 women) with a CRC diagnosis duration of 1 to 12 months, completed a telephone interview and written questionnaire, assessing demographics, disease/treatment characteristics, threat appraisal, social support, optimism, coping, benefit-finding and quality of life domains, at approximately five- and 12-months post-diagnosis. To identify CRC-specific coping strategies, the Coping with Colorectal Cancer measure was developed in the initial study. The eight factor structure was confirmed, and the subscales (Positive Perceptual Change; Religion/Spirituality; Rumination; Acceptance; Humour; Palliative; Seeking Social Support; and Lifestyle Reorganisation) found to have reliability and preliminary criterion-related validity within the context of the stress and coping framework. As predicted, regression analyses showed that, after controlling for demographics, disease/treatment characteristics and stress/coping variables, the coping subscales uniquely predicted Time 1 QOL outcomes, with Seeking Social Support continuing to predict Time 2 Positive Affect. In the second study, the benefit-finding domains specific to those with CRC were identified, and relationships with quality of life outcomes assessed, to determine the inclusion of benefit-finding in the path model. Based on completed data from 1757 of the initial 1800 participants, confirmatory factor analyses revealed three domains of benefit-finding: Personal Growth; Interpersonal Growth and Acceptance. As hypothesised, regressions analyses found that benefit-finding domains at Time 1 was associated with Time 1 QOL outcomes, specifically, Positive Affect and Cancer-related Quality of Life (both the aggregate score and its Social/Family, Functional and Colorectal Cancer-specific Well-being subscales). Time 1 Personal Growth also predicted Time 1 Psychological Distress. After controlling for Time 1 Positive Affect, Personal Growth continued to predict Time 2 Positive Affect. The final study drew on the results of the first two studies, which informed the coping strategies and benefit-finding domains to be included in regression analyses initially, and then, structural equation modelling. The final study included 1276 complete data sets of the initial 1800 participants. Parameters of the initial hypothesised model of the stress and coping framework, including relationships with benefit-finding (based on empirical findings) failed to fit the model to the data. After several revisions, the analysis revealed that the final model fit the data, where stress, coping and benefit-finding accounted for 63% of the variance in Time 1 QOL. The model showed that threat appraisal, coping resources, avoidant coping and benefit-finding directly impacted on Time 1 QOL, while threat appraisal, social support and approach coping directly impacted on benefit-finding. In this study, the approach coping strategies included in the path model could also be conceptualised as meaning-based coping strategies, as they appeared to facilitate a meaning-making process. However, benefit-finding, which some researchers have suggested is also a meaning-based coping strategy, had differential relationships with stress, coping and outcome variables, compared with the approach coping strategies. These results indicate that benefit-finding is an empirically distinct construct in the context of CRC. Finally, in this study, the impact of stress, coping and benefit-finding on Time 2 QOL, was indirect, being mediated by Time 1 QOL outcomes. The accumulated findings of these three studies have extended the cancer coping and benefit-finding research by revealing new relations between stress, coping and benefit-finding and QOL in a mixed-gender, older population with CRC. There are implications for measurement of, and theory building around benefit-finding. Finally, these studies inform the development of clinical interventions to enhance the quality of life in the short- and longer-term for individuals diagnosed with CRC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">benefit-finding, stress and coping, colorectal cancer, quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180115</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aged Horse Health, Management and Welfare</field><field name="creator">Thomas Mcgowan</field><field name="description">Abstract Background: Aged horses make up an important portion of the equine industry in Australia but have not been the subjects of detailed research. Issues relating to aged horse health, management and welfare are still largely unknown. Horses live up to 40 years, but many are retired before reaching twenty years of age thus making a large discrepancy between productive verses unproductive life. Based principally on reviews of veterinary hospital records, there has been a reported increased occurrence and severity of a range of diseases in aged horses. The increased prevalence of disease, potential for reduced perceived value and lack of regular riding may contribute to reduction in the type and quality of management practices utilised in this population resulting in compromised welfare of aged horses. Aims: By way of an owner-based survey, the first aim was to examine the demographics of aged horses, their management, the prevalence of clinical signs of disease and owner reported health or welfare issues. Using a detailed veterinary clinical examination and appropriate laboratory tests, the second aim was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of more common health disorders, prevention or management of these disorders and how diseases or other factors affect survival. Further, this study aimed to determine owners&#8217; opinions relating to euthanasia of aged horses and to correlate these opinions with the personalities of the owners themselves. Methods: Owners of horses aged 15 years and older were contacted via equestrian organisations in Queensland, Australia and asked to complete a questionnaire on key information about the horse (e.g. age, breed, sex, and colour), use, management strategies, use of equine health care providers, clinical signs that the horse may be demonstrating, known diseases that the horse may have experienced or be experiencing, and identify any health or welfare issues they believed were important for horses aged 15 years or greater. From this population, a subsample was selected with these horses subjected to a thorough clinical examination, dental and ocular examination and blood tests for routine haematology, serum biochemistry, ACTH, &#945;-MSH and insulin concentrations. Owners of the subsample of horses were asked to complete a questionnaire on their opinions of euthanasia of aged horses as well as complete a self assessment personality test. One to four years after the original survey, owners were contacted to gather additional information about the horses&#8217; survival/death and if death had occurred the events and causes related to it. Analysis: Data was managed in Microsoft Access and Excel. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS, Minitab and Stata. Univariable and multivariable regression modelling and survival analysis were performed where appropriate. Results: Horses aged 15 years or greater in Queensland represented &#8531;rd of the total horses owned in the population. The median age of the horses was 20.7 years (IQ range 17-23, min 15, max 44). Owners were able to identify many clinical signs exhibited by their horses, with 83% of horses having at least one reported clinical sign of disease. But, many signs had apparently been overlooked, with only 35.2% of horses reported by the owners to have a known disease or disorder. Further, there was a large disparity between the prevalence of disease by owner reports compared to veterinary examination. For example, owner reported dental disease was 0.5% while moderate to severe dental disease occurred in 46% horses examined. Univariable and multivariable analysis identified many associations between disease and horse factors, management factors and clinical signs, with many diseases significantly related to increasing age. There was considerable variation in the level of owner reported professional and other health care strategies. In the preceding 12 months, 90% had received hoof care, 67% had received dental care, and 50% were vaccinated, while only 39% had received veterinary care. Despite this owners expressed concern about the health and welfare of their horses. The majority of owners, 91.6% (491/536), responded with at least one reply to a question about which they thought were the most important health issues in aged horses. Owners were most concerned about weight loss (maintaining the horse&#8217;s condition), arthritis/lameness and teeth and dental care. The major influences on the decision to euthanase involved animal welfare and quality of life and owners were cognizant and concerned about these factors relative to their horses. Of the 766 horses that were followed for survival, 13.2% had died. The median survival time was 777days. Age, breed of horse, region of residence, diagnosis of equine Cushing&#8217;s syndrome, being owned by Riding for the Disabled and reported history of difficulty eating were all significantly associated with decreased survival. Conclusions: This is the first major population study of aged horses in Australia. The aged horse population is a large sub population of the Australian horse population. This study has highlighted many aged related diseases and their specific risk factors. Owners demonstrated concern for the health and welfare of aged horses, but a lack of appropriate identification of many diseases by owners and limited veterinary care suggest a need for increased client communication and veterinarian-client interaction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Equine</field><field name="subject">equine management</field><field name="subject">equine epidemiology</field><field name="subject">equine health</field><field name="subject">equine welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180103</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light Scattering in Complex Mesoscale Systems: Modelling Optical Trapping and Micromachines</field><field name="creator">Vincent Loke</field><field name="description">Optical tweezers using highly focussed laser beams can be used to exert forces and torques and thus drive micromachines. This opens up a new field of microengineering, whose potential has yet to be fully realized. Until now, methods that have been used for modelling optical tweezers are limited to scatterers that are homogeneous or that have simple geometry. To aid in designing more general micromachines, I developed and implemented two main methods for modelling the micromachines that we use. These methods can be used for further proposed structures to be fabricated. The first is a FDFD/T-matrix hybrid method that incorporates the finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) method, which is used for inhomogeneous and anisotropic media, with vector spherical wave functions (VSWF) to formulate the T-matrix. The T-matrix is then used to calculate the torque of the trapped vaterite sphere, which is apparently composed of birefringent unit crystals but the bulk structure appears to be arranged in a sheaf-of-wheat fashion. The second method is formulating the T-matrix via discrete dipole approximation (DDA) of complex arbitrarily shaped mesoscale objects and implementing symmetry optimizations to allow calculations to be performed on high-end desktop PCs that are otherwise impractical due to memory requirements and calculation time. This method was applied to modelling microrotors. The T-matrix represents the scattering properties of an object for a given wavelength. Once it is calculated, subsequent calculations with different illumination conditions can be performed rapidly. This thesis also deals with studies of other light scattering phenomena including the modelling of scattered fields from protein molecules subsequently used to model FRET resonance, determining the limits of trappability, interferometric Brownian motion and the comparison between integral transforms by direct numerical integration and overdetermined point-matching.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Light scattering</field><field name="subject">computational modelling</field><field name="subject">mesoscale</field><field name="subject">optical trapping</field><field name="subject">optical tweezers</field><field name="subject">micromachines</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183726</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the effects of a lifestyle intervention on body fat distribution and fatty acid metabolism: Study of obese non-diabetic adults and a case study of McArdle disease</field><field name="creator">Stephanie Ipavec Levasseur</field><field name="description">The global epidemic of obesity is rapidly becoming a major public health problem in many parts of the world. Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity are two modifiable risk factors for prevention of obesity and its associated chronic diseases. Their influence on muscle energy metabolism and fat mass is not completely elucidated. A decreased capacity for fatty acid oxidation (FAO) may be a metabolic risk factor for weight gain and is found to be depressed in obese individuals; and exercise training may promote an increased capacity for FAO. In addition to the interest in whole-body FAO, the role of site specific lipid accumulation including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) has become a focus of interest because of their reported association with insulin resistance (IR), a key metabolic defect associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, ambiguity persists regarding the importance of IMCL as a metabolic substrate for energy production in obesity. A better understanding of the factors regulating FAO, body fat distribution and IMCL mobilisation is important for the development of interventions allowing effective treatment of conditions in which these are disturbed. The study of individuals with metabolic myopathies can give more information about the energy metabolism of muscle. McArdle disease (MD) affects glucose availability to muscle for energy production. Investigations into IMCL storage and mobilisation in MD have not been reported. The aims of this thesis are to investigate 1) the effects of weight-loss via dietary restriction plus modest but clinically-relevant exercise training on FAO, body fat distribution and mobilisation of IMCL during exercise in obese non-diabetic adults; 2) the effect of an exercise training intervention on IMCL storage and mobilisation in a subject with MD. All obese subjects underwent a 4 month lifestyle intervention with weekly meetings with a dietitian and an exercise physiologist. Of the 92 subjects, 73 completed the intervention. They showed significant decreases in body weight (8%), fat mass (14%) and total cholesterol (5%). The exercise prescription of 1500 kcal.week-1 resulted in variable compliance with the prescription (1224 &#177; 1085 kcal.week-1) measured by heart rate monitor. Those who did most exercise and also those who had less weekly variability in their exercise, had greater reductions in body weight and fat mass. The total activity energy expenditure measured by accelerometry did not change post-intervention but there was a reduction in low intensity activity and an increase in moderate and high intensity activity. A submaximal treadmill test and resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry was measured before and after the intervention to investigate factors regulating FAO and energy expenditure. Subjects showed increases in FAO without change in energy expenditure for the same walking speed post intervention, but the volume of exercise completed during the intervention was not associated with these changes. To investigate body fat distribution in obesity, VAT, IHL and soleus muscle IMCL was measured in a sub-group of 18 males by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) along with measurement of maximal aerobic capacity. Fitness increased significantly with significant decreases in VAT (29%) and IHL (54%), without significant change in IMCL. Subjects who had the greatest decrease in VAT were those who exercised for longer durations during the intervention. IHL was the only measure of excess lipid that correlated with IR. The measurement of IMCL before and after 1-hour of cycle ergometer exercise showed no significant mobilisation of IMCL either at baseline or after the lifestyle intervention. The intensity of the acute exercise was adjusted to correspond to each individual&#8217;s maximal fatty acid oxidation (MFAO) which increased by over 60% post intervention. In the subject with MD, an 8 week exercise training intervention without dietary intervention increased IMCL stores by 27%, but there was no marked change in IMCL with acute exercise at both time points. The findings of this thesis demonstrate that a clinically relevant and achievable lifestyle intervention incorporating weight loss through diet and objectively measured exercise can achieve improvements in blood lipid profile, body composition and FAO. The differential effects of the intervention on the various fat depots and their associations to metabolic markers suggest that individualised strategies may be required dependent upon body fat distribution. The non detection of mobilisation of IMCL by MRS suggests that these lipids may not be present as a substrate source in this population but rather an ectopic lipid depot related to increased energy consumption in diet. The relatively low capacity for FAO in both the obese and MD subjects may have affected the results. This thesis discusses implications for clinical practice, discusses novel findings related to the energy metabolism in obesity and MD and informs clinical and basic science about important future directions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">body fat distribution</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">fatty acid oxidation</field><field name="subject">intrahepatic lipids</field><field name="subject">intramyocellular lipids</field><field name="subject">lifestyle intervention</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">McArdle disease</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">visceral adipose tissue</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ISOLATION AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION OF SECONDARY METABOLITES FROM SOUTH-EAST QUEENSLAND INVERTEBRATES AND INDONESIAN MARINE SPONGES</field><field name="creator">I Wayan Mudianta</field><field name="description">Isolation and structure elucidation of natural products from marine sponges and an invertebrate were performed. The marine sponges and invertebrate were obtained from three locations including South East Queensland, in Australia, Pontianak in West Kalimantan, and Tulamben, in Bali, Indonesia. The natural products were purified using chromatographic techniques, the structures were elucidated by means of extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and some were confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Five known compounds and potentially a new metabolite were identified from three different sponges and a species of nudibranch obtained in Mooloolaba, South East Queensland in Australia. Furospinosulin-1 (4.5), a linear sesterterpenoid, was identified from a sponge coded 20-1-07-1-7 while imidazole alkaloids, preclathridine A (4.9) and clathridine (4.10), were characterized from sponge 22-4-07-2-1. The ethyl acetate extract of sponge 14-7-07-1-1 yielded a polyacetylene fulvinol-like compound (4.15) and potentially a new metabolite compound 5 (4.21). Additionally, a specimen of Chromodoris kuiteri furnished a cyclic macrolide latrunculin A (4.27). There were six secondary metabolites identified from Aaptos aaptos, two of which to the best of our knowledge were new compounds. Aaptamine (5.1), a chemotaxonomic marker of the sponge A. aaptos, 9-demethylaaptamine (5.3) and a biosynthetically unrelated compound (-)-jaspamide (5.31) were found as major constituents of the dichloromethane extract of the sponge. On the other hand, a known indole-3-carbaldehyde (5.10), and the two new natural products methyl 3-(8,9-dimethoxy-4H-benzo[de][1,6]naphthyridin-4-yl)propanoate (5.11) and 8,9-dimethoxy-4H-benzo[de][1,6]naphthyridine-5,6-dione (5.30) were isolated as minor components. During a two-month fieldwork trip to Tulamben, Bali, six different sponges were obtained. Investigation of a blue colored sponge Petrosia sp. afforded two isoquinolinequinone metabolites, namely mimosamycin (5.35) and O-demethylrenierone (5.36). A new 3-alkylpiperidine metabolite, tetradehydrohaliclonacyclamine A (6.28), was isolated from a sponge Halichondria sp. The structure and relative stereochemistry of 6.28 were determined from analysis of 2D NMR data and interpretation of coupling constants. Suitable crystals that were grown from hexane: ethyl acetate (1:3) allowed the determination of the absolute configuration of 6.28 and it was established to be 2S, 3S, 7S, and 9S on the basis of X-ray crystallographic data. The isolated compound (6.28) appeared to be as a single enantiomer according to chiral HPLC. The parent compounds, haliclonacyclamine A (6.19) and B (6.20), were re-isolated from a sample (coded BK-Hal-12-AIK) obtained from a previous project on Haliclona in our group. Their absolute configurations were determined for the first time by X-ray crystallography and they were established to be 2R, 3R, 7R, and 9R.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural products, marine sponges, haliclonacyclamines.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183840</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essential and Nonessential Genes of Bovine Herpesvirus-1</field><field name="creator">Karl Robinson</field><field name="description">Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is an important pathogen of cattle associated with respiratory and reproductive disease and is the most common viral agent implicated in the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). BRDC is an economically significant multifactorial disease of feedlot cattle estimated to cost Australian feedlot producers $AU60 million/year in lost production, therapeutics and disease management. Worldwide BRDC is attributed to cost $US2 billion to cattle industries. In an effort to limit the associated economic costs and enhance animal health and welfare of feedlot cattle, the concerted use of vaccination and diseased animal management are practiced. Numerous vaccines are available in North America and Canada however, in Australia, feedlot producers are reliant on three vaccines. These vaccines target either the bacterial or viral agents of the BRDC and encompass antibody, subunit and attenuated live BoHV-1 preparations. Live attenuated vaccines are developed by numerous methods including, deletion or disruption of certain genes. The development of an attenuated live virus vaccine was traditionally a laborious task requiring numerous rounds of in vitro purification. Contrastingly, technological advances introduced this decade, allowing the stable maintenance of the complete herpesvirus genome in bacteria as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), has advanced herpes virology exponentially in that investigation and manipulation of the herpesvirus genome can be conducted independent of a cell culture system. With respect to BRDC and the generation of vaccines to combat the disease, the tools to fully utilise the potential of BoHV-1 as a live vaccine vector are now routine. It is now possible to vii construct BoHV-1 as a delivery vector by inserting appropriate antigens of those bacterial and viral pathogens implicated in the BRDC into a BAC maintained BoHV-1 genome. However, there is a significant lack of genetic information regarding BoHV-1 and inserting several antigenic sequences would expand the genome of BoHV-1 inducing non-viability. Therefore, to further develop BoHV-1 as a vaccine vector, a study was conducted to identify the essential and nonessential genes required for the in vitro viability of BoHV-1. Identifying the essential and nonessential genes will establish which genes may be preferentially deleted or replaced with exogenous antigenic sequences in a BoHV-1 derived vaccine vector. To define the requirement of genes encoded by BoHV-1, random-insertion mutagenesis utilising a Tn5 transposition system and targeted gene deletion catalysed by GET recombination was employed to construct gene disruption and gene deletion libraries, respectively, of an infectious clone of BoHV-1. Transposon insertion position and confirmation of gene deletion was determined by direct sequencing. with the essential or nonessential requirement of either transposed or deleted open reading frames (ORFs) assessed by transfection of respective BoHV- 1 BAC DNA into host cells. Of the 73 recognised ORFs encoded by the BoHV-1 genome, 33 were determined to be essential and 36 to be nonessential for virus viability in cell culture with the requirement of the two dual copy ORFs inconclusive. The majority of ORFs were shown to conform to the in vitro requirements of BoHV-1 homologues encoded by Human herpesvirus 1. However, ORFs encoding for glycoprotein K (UL53), regulatory, membrane, tegument and capsid proteins (UL54, UL49.5, UL49, UL35, UL20, UL16 and UL7) were shown to differ in requirement when compared to Human herpesvirus-1 encoded homologues. Further analysis of clones encompassing restriction digestion profiling, one-step growth and replication kinetic analysis defined the genetic constitution and replicative capacity of the mutant clones. Thirty-three individual ORFs of the 36 defined nonessential ORF were identified as being amenable to deletion without causing significant replicative detriment to a potential BoHV-1 vaccine vector. This study has provided the foundational information required for the future development of BoHV-1 as a multivalent vaccine vector for the protection of feedlot cattle from BRDC. Furthermore, the genetic information generated in this study contributes to the general knowledge of the prototype ruminant herpesvirus, BoHV-1, and contributes to the comparative study of gene function between the large and diverse family that is Herpesviridae.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">Bovine Herpesvirus-1</field><field name="subject">Bacterial Artificial Chromosome</field><field name="subject">Gene Requirement</field><field name="subject">Transposon Mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">GET recombination</field><field name="subject">Vaccine Vector</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183917</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration as Transnational Leisure: The Japanese in South-East Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jun Nagatomo</field><field name="description">In the 1990s, the bubble of the Japanese miracle economy burst and the country fell into recession. Following this, Japan experienced considerable economic and social transformation, including a reconsideration of its approach to work and employment. Among the consequences of these changes, such as unprecedented mobility in the labour market and an increase in part-time employment, there was a shift in lifestyle values, particularly those of middle class Japanese. In contrast to the traditional Japanese work ethic and company-orientated lifestyle which prized collectivism and self-sacrifice, new lifestyle values were largely centred on attaining an improved life-work balance which was less structured and more &#8216;Western.&#8217; These new individualised lifestyle values began to be reflected in a new-found interest in leisure, characterised by a shift from group-oriented leisure activities to more individualised and personalised ones. There has been another very significant change of great relevance to this thesis: an increased and unprecedented interest in overseas tourism and migration. This thesis discusses an intriguing new dynamic between the transformation of the economy and the Japanese engagement with tourism and migration. Until the 1990s, due to the guaranteed lifetime employment and the prevalence of seniority systems of Japanese corporations, there was a relatively stable life model among Japan&#8217;s middle class. In addition to healthy demand in the domestic labour market and work-dominated lifestyle, stable work opportunities meant this group rarely considered pursuing individual tourism and migration. However, since the 1990s, increasing numbers of young middle class Japanese began to drift from the safe and assured life model and chose to live abroad. This thesis, based on qualitative methodology and in-depth interviews with 31 Japanese migrants to Queensland, is a study of Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. It draws upon several important topics and theories in contemporary sociology including globalisation, transnationalism, migration and tourism. The complex linkages between these themes are an important characteristic of this thesis and are discussed in the literature review of Chapter 2. The methodological issues of this research are presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contextualises lifestyle migration against the background of broader history of Japanese migration to Australia. The chapters that follow examine three key themes pertinent to exploring the interrelationship between social transformation in Japanese society in the 1990s, changing lifestyle values and migration to Australia. Chapter 5 considers the implications of social transformation of Japanese society, specifically focusing on the lifestyle value shifts as push factors in a broad sense. Chapter 6 explores the pull factors and focuses on motivations for migration to Australia. Chapter 7 examines the lives of Japanese lifestyle migrants in Australia and highlights a unique settlement process characterised by the lack of upward social mobility, the absence of geographical concentration of Japanese migrants and the impact this has on the formation of a sustainable ethnic community. Finally, Chapter 8 summarises the argument of this thesis and discusses its contribution to the field of sociology. Possible directions for future research are also outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">lifestyle migration</field><field name="subject">ethnic community</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="subject">social transformation</field><field name="subject">Australian multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Japanese society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183953</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeting central nervous system active peptides to the brain via nasal delivery</field><field name="creator">Cecile Cros</field><field name="description">The development of peptides as therapeutic agents has been hampered by their poor enzymatic stability and bioavailability. Many strategies, such as chemical modification, synthesis of peptidomimetics and formulation, have been employed to overcome these issues. For central nervous system (CNS) active peptides, the blood brain barrier is an added hurdle. Nasal delivery is believed to provide a direct access to the brain via the olfactory nerve, which would bypass the blood brain barrier. This route of administration, however, is dependant on the size and physico-chemical properties of the administered drug. For these reasons, three CNS active peptides were chosen as models. Leu-enkephalin, endomorphin-1 and a-conotoxin MII are three peptides that differ in their size, amino acid sequence and conformation. Using chemical modifications to improve their stability and ability to cross biological membranes, in vitro assessments of derivatives of these peptides were performed and in vivo nasal delivery was attempted on the most promising candidates. The chemical modifications consisted in the addition of lipids and/or sugars to the N- or C-terminus of the peptides. Assessment of the in vivo bioavailability after nasal administration, however, proved to be challenging. The initial method chosen for this purpose was the use of tritiated acetic anhydride which would radiolabel the peptide via acetylation at the N-terminus of the peptide derivatives. Consequently, in vitro stability and permeability of each acetylated derivatives was also studied. Acetylation of the lipidic derivatives, which formed an amide bond, proved to be beneficial for the stability of the lipidic peptides. In contrast, acetylation of the Nterminus sugar derivatives, which formed an ester bond at one or several positions of the sugar, was an unstable modification. Thus, an extraction method for the tested peptides from rat tissues was developed, and LC-MS/MS analyses were conducted to measure the level of peptide in the olfactory bulbs, brain and blood. Leu-enkephalin derivatives were all amide derivatives at the C-terminus of the peptide. The most successful Leu-enkephalinamide derivatives were C8-LeuEnk (2), C12- LeuEnk (3) and Lac-LeuEnk (8), which are the Leu-enphelinamide peptide modified with a C8 lipoamino acid, a C12 lipoamino acid and a lactose moiety respectively. They all exhibited improved permeability across Caco-2 monolayers and stability in Caco-2 cell homogenate and/or plasma. Problems of solubility encountered with C12-LeuEnk (3), however, hampered its testing in vivo after nasal administration. C8-LeuEnk (2) and Lac-LeuEnk (8) were administered intranasally to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Both peptides were found in the olfactory bulbs after 10 minutes administration (2: 49.2 &#177; 15.6 nM; 8: 40.6 &#177; 14.6 nM) while blood concentration remained low, showing that the peptide reached the olfactory bulbs directly from the nasal cavity via the olfactory nerve. Brain concentrations were 13.5 &#177; 10.1 nM for C8-LeuEnk (2) and 13.6 &#177; 6.9 nM for Lac-LeuEnk (8). These two peptides brain concentrations seemed to be high enough to exhibit analgesic effect when compared to their binding affinity in vitro. This was not statistically significant, however, due to the high standard deviations observed (Ki&#956; C8-LeuEnk (2) = 7.74 &#177; 1.15 nM; Ki&#956; Lac-LeuEnk (8) = 6.69 &#177; 1.81 nM). Endomorphin-1 was only modified at the N-terminus as previous results have shown that the activity of the peptide is strongly decreased by C-terminus modifications. The most successful modification, regarding permeability across Caco-2 monolayers and water solubility, was shown to be the addition of a lactose moiety to the N-terminus of the peptide. Lac-Endo1 (16) exhibited a permeability of 1.91 &#177; 0.76 x 10-6 cm/s and was soluble at the concentration used for in vivo nasal administration (2 mg/Kg, 50 &#956;L administration). After 10 minutes administration, Lac-Endo1 (16) was found in the olfactory bulbs (418 &#177; 410 nM), in the brain (4.01 &#177; 4.61 nM) and in the blood (1.58 &#177; 1.85 nM). The large standard deviations observed reflect the difficulties encountered with the extraction process of this peptide. A direct transport for the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb was observed as illustrated by the low blood concentrations. Brain concentrations, however, were too low to expect a strong analgesic effect from this compound after nasal administration (Ki&#956; Lac-Endo1 (16) = 11.3 &#177; 1.2 nM). a-Conotoxin MII is a 16 amino acid long peptide containing two disulfide bonds. The formation of these two disulfide bonds leads to low yields in the synthesis of the derivatives of this peptide. Addition of a lipidic moiety to the peptide did not seem to improve its permeability through biological membranes. This modification resulted in highly lipophilic peptides with dissolution issues in water based media such as those used in the permeability experiments. The most successful a-conotoxin MII derivative was GS-Ctx (25) which exhibited a permeability of 4.22 &#177; 0.53 x 10-7 cm/s across Caco-2 monolayers. This permeability, however, was too low to consider in vivo administration. In conclusion, we successfully synthesised a series of derivatives of Leu-enkephalin, endomorphin-1 and a-conotoxin MII and screened them through Caco-2 monolayers for permeability and Caco-2 cell homogenates and human plasma for stability. Three derivatives (C8-LeuEnk (2), Lac-LeuEnk (8) and Lac-Endo1 (16)) were intranasally administered and found in the olfactory bulbs 10 minutes after administration. The low blood concentrations observed show that a direct transport from the nasal cavity to the brain occurs. Thus, nasal administration could be an option for delivering to the brain low molecular weight peptides exhibiting increased stability and permeability in vitro.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nasal delivery</field><field name="subject">CNS active peptides</field><field name="subject">Leu-enkephalin</field><field name="subject">Endomorphin 1</field><field name="subject">Alpha conotoxin MII</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184027</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Contextual Approach for Ethical Analysis in Clinical Genetics</field><field name="creator">Madelyn Peterson</field><field name="description">Genetic medicine is an emerging area of healthcare which constantly raises novel ethical challenges in the clinical realm due to its capacity to reveal information that has deeply personal meaning. Genetic tests can reveal more than is strictly essential for immediate medical care because they can diagnose conditions that cannot be cured, treated or effectively managed. The diagnosis of a genetic condition in one individual can have repercussions throughout an extended family, and genetic knowledge has created innovative, technologically driven, reproductive options. For clients of genetic counselling, moral choice does not readily result from uncluttered logic or easy personal preference, nor does it involve the application of sterile principles and laws, but is a much richer process involving personal history and culture, as well as reflection upon personal values, current resources and projected life goals. For these reasons, I question the validity of the exclusive use of a narrow version of Principlism, as it is commonly operationalised, for the medical sub-specialty of clinical genetics. Its heavy emphasis on individual autonomy, which has become synonymous with clinical medicine, does not take into account the fact that most genetic tests have little or no immediate clinical utility, or that genetic medicine is primarily about the way in which genetic conditions pass through families, and management of recurrence risks by choice of reproductive options. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to develop and explore a broader contextual moral framework, which is better suited to deliberation about complex ethical dilemmas in clinical genetics, than the current dominant approach which tends to follow a restrictive and non-inclusive application of Principlism. To achieve this aim, I have started with a review of relevant history and socio-political forces that have shaped the current status of the genetic medicine, and examined the evolution of current attitudes that underpin recognition, analysis and management of the ethical challenges in genetic medicine. I have analysed the manner in which Principlism and other normative theories are employed by bioethicists and clinicians in response to ethical dilemmas, and presented an alternative approach which employs a broader contextual ethical framework. I have devised an approach which attends to the importance of both current social opinion, and the tradition of evidence-based medicine, with reference to selected traditions in philosophical analysis. vi In conclusion, I advocate attention to concrete circumstances, which includes recognition of historical development, which has shaped current medical and wider social values, beliefs, norms and attitudes political context, including critical analysis of relevant political motivations social context, particularly situational power structures, trust relationships and relational obligations personal values, resources and experiences of the stakeholder(s) the range of realistically available options for the stakeholder(s) the impact of economic limits, which might be institutional and / or personal And, to achieve this objective of building a &#8216;thick&#8217; ethical discourse, I propose a series of questions, which can be readily utilised by genetic and non-genetic health professionals as well as other members of society to work towards resolutions that represent a balance of fairness, economic responsibility with scarce resources, and socially acceptability. This approach appropriately attends to the relational and communicative aspects of moral dilemmas in clinical genetics, and is likely to yield more meaningful (and less likely paternalistic) conclusions, which would be of greater value to our morally pluralist society.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">medical ethics</field><field name="subject">contextual ethics</field><field name="subject">genetic counselling</field><field name="subject">feminist ethics</field><field name="subject">narrative ethics</field><field name="subject">paternalism,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184055</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotoxic Alkaloids from Australian Marine Sponges</field><field name="creator">Mohamed El-naggar</field><field name="description">Australia's marine environment covers extended areas, from the warm northern tropical, to the sub tropical central water, the cool temperate water of the south and the cold sub-Antarctic and Antarctic water. Australia has rich area of coral reefs. The marine biodiversity in Australia is enormous. Despite incredible biodiversity, Australian research in the marine anticancer drug discoveries is low in comparison with other countries. In this research we investigated a collection of marine sponges as a source for new anticancer leads. This thesis comprises six chapters. Chapter 1 covers the importance of natural products as a source of new drugs, and an introduction to cancer as a disease, chemotherapy in cancer treatments, and the natural products as a source for anticancer drugs. Also, the basic anticancer drug development process is highlighted. Finally, a thorough review of anticancer alkaloids isolated from marine sponges is presented. Chapter 2 presents the chemical investigation into a southern Australian marine sponge Stelletta sp., which led to the isolation and structure elucidation of bistellettazines A-C the first reported examples of terpenyl-pyrrolizidines conjugate, and bistellettazole A, a unique cyclic terpenyl-imidazole conjugate. Bistellettazines A-C and bistellettazole A feature unprecedented carbon skeletons that are proposed to share a common convergent biosynthetic origin, arising via the biogenic equivalent of a Diels-Alder addition between two hypothetical polyenyl norsesquiterpene precursors. The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) for these new alkaloids is also discussed. Chapter 3 discusses the isolation and structure elucidation of four new discorhabdins analogues namely, dihydrodiscorhabdin A, debromodiscorhabdin A, discorhabdin X and dihydrodiscorhabdin L. In addition, the known compounds discorhabdin A and discorhabdin D, were isolated from two southern Australian marine sponge specimens of the genera Higginsia and Spongosorites. The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) for these new alkaloids was also discussed. Chapter 4 discloses chemical investigation into two southern Australian marine sponge specimens of the genera Clathria and Ptilocaulis. Four new mirabilin analogues (mirabilins H-K) were isolated and characterized along with known mirabilin C, F (for the first time as TFA salt) and mirabilin G. The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) for these new alkaloids was also discussed. Chapter 5 presents the 1H NMR data for the known compounds isolated during this study, and Chapter 6 is covering the experimental part.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">sponge, marine, secondary metabolites, anticancer, alkaloids, bistellettazine, bistellettazole, discorhabdin, mirabilin.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184065</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment of Reverse Osmosis Concentrates from Recycled Water</field><field name="creator">Arseto Yekti Bagastyo</field><field name="description">Water recycling by membrane treatment is widely accepted as a leading alternative water source. This separation process creates a concentrated stream (called concentrates), containing most of the pollutants in 10%-20% of the flow; and a treated water stream. As nitrogen is a major concern, environmental regulations have become more stringent, requiring additional treatment to meet effluent standards. Other concerns include organic contaminants and potential production of halogenated organics if disinfection of the reject was applied. One option to address the problem of dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon is advanced oxidation. This oxidation could lead to degradation of refractory organic materials, which are poorly removed in conventional treatment. This project aims to evaluate treatment extent and cost of alternatives for organic (particularly nitrogen) removal in reject water addressing the following research gaps: (i) identifying the key organic pollutants present in the concentrated stream, (ii) the effectiveness and optimisation of coagulation, ion exchange and advanced oxidation; (iii) apparent cost of the different treatment methods. The untreated reverse osmosis concentrates were collected from two treatment plants:- Luggage Point, and Bundamba, both near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The first contains more colourful of organics than the second plant. Stirred cell fractionation with ultrafiltration membranes was used to characterise the removed key pollutants, as it offers better accuracy and reproducibility compared to centrifugation fractionation. Fluorescence spectral was used to monitor and identify specific organic compounds. The largest fraction was smaller sized &lt;1kDa. This is probably small humic substances and fulvic acids, as indicated by Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) analysis. A smaller portion of soluble microbial products (SMPs) also contributes to the concentrates. Bundamba contains large non coloured organics including organic nitrogen with elevated ammonia-N. In contrast, Luggage Point has higher colour, inorganic carbon and conductivity with less ammonia-N. Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) was the most effective treatment method (high removal of organics, e.g. 55% COD of initial), followed by magnetised ion exchange (MIEX) and coagulations. For UV/H2O2 AOP, the optimal operating condition 400mg.L-1 H2O2 and 3.1kWh.m-3 energy input resulted in organics removals up to 55% with complete decolourisation. The effective reduction was found in all size ranges, preferably in &gt;1kDa. Low inorganic carbon and salinity in Bundamba may allow better overall oxidation rates. MIEX also performed better in Bundamba with organic removals up to 43% and 80% decolourisation at the optimum resin dose of 15mL.L-1. Removal was preferential in size range of &gt;3kDa, with more proportional percentage for decolourisation. Similarly, ferric coagulation removed a wider size range of organics. Further, ferric achieved better organic removal in Luggage Point with up to 49%. At the same molar dose (1.5mM), ferric is superior to alum, especially in Bundamba where there were less hydrophobic compounds according to EEM. Alum is poor for treatment of high organics with less coloured water. MIEX with an operational cost (chemicals and power only) of $0.14-$0.20.m-3 treated water seemed to be the most effective treatment overall. The resin achieved better results with a slightly higher cost than coagulation, and had a lower environmental impact due to reduced sludge production. AOP offers better treatment, but at a higher cost ($0.47.m-3 treated). Combined alternatives may benefit the removal effectiveness. Furthermore, more specific identification of contaminants should be investigated separately to choose appropriate treatment for priority chemicals. Another issue is further investigation of costing, including capital, and full environmental impact of treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water reclamation</field><field name="subject">Reverse Osmosis Concentrates</field><field name="subject">coagulation</field><field name="subject">ion exchange resin</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Advanced oxidation process</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184190</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE FOR BIOPESTICIDE CONTROL OF LIVESTOCK ECTOPARASITES</field><field name="creator">Diana Leemon</field><field name="description">THESIS ABSTRACT Current control strategies for livestock ectoparasites are limited by problems associated with chemical resistance and residues. Fungal biopesticides could provide an alternative control without these problems. However, a strategic approach is needed to first evaluate the suitability of selected fungal isolates for fungal biopesticide development. Two ectoparasites of significance to cattle and sheep are the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini) and the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (Wiedmann). The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin) was evaluated for its potential to control these livestock ectoparasites. The growth characteristics of 30 isolates of M. anisopliae were investigated. Radial growth measurements were used to identify vigorous isolates that grew well at 30&#61616;C and were capable of growing at 35&#61616;C. A qualitative assessment of sporulation capacity further refined the candidate isolate group. A possible nutritive role of oil in the formulation was also investigated. However, there was no clear support for the theory that oil as a formulation additive could boost the germination and growth of the fungal conidia in vitro. Quantal response bioassays were conducted with cattle ticks and sheep blowflies using a range of conidial doses of three different isolates of M. anisopliae and different methods of inoculation. Ticks were either dosed with 2 &#181;l or immersed in the conidial doses. Blowflies were either dosed with 2 &#181;l of the conidial doses or fed conidia mixed with sugar. Probit analyses were carried out on the mortality data to compare the virulence of these isolates to ticks and blowflies and look for indications of different virulence mechanisms employed by M. anisopliae isolates when invading these hosts. One isolate (ARIM16) showed high virulence to both hosts killing 95 % of ticks after two days and 88 (&#177;2) % of blowflies after four days. Strikingly different mortality patterns indicated quite different virulence mechanisms operating when M. anisopliae invades ticks or blowflies. The mortality pattern seen with ticks suggested that the number of conidia adhering per unit area of the cuticle was more important for rapid tick death than the total number of conidia contacting the entire tick surface. Blowflies fed conidia mixed with food died rapidly after an initial lag phase regardless of dose. Microscopic investigations were carried out to resolve the basis of the virulence patterns observed. The spatial and temporal aspects of the invasion of ticks and blowflies by M. anisopliae isolate ARIM16 were investigated with different types of microscopy. The scanning electron microscope and stereo light microscope were used to record surface changes and events and the compound light microscope revealed internal changes. Two distinctly different patterns of invasion were found in ticks and blowflies. Fungal conidia germinated on the surface of ticks then hyphae simultaneously penetrated into the tick body and grew across the tick surface. There was extensive fungal degradation of the tick cuticle with a preference for the outer endocuticle. While large numbers of conidia adhered to the surface of blowflies, no conidia were recorded germinating on external surfaces. One germinating conidium was seen in the entrance to the buccal cavity. Investigations of the fly interior revealed a higher density of hyphal bodies in the haemolymph surrounding the buccal cavity than in haemolymph from regions of the upper thorax. This pattern suggested that fungal invasion of the blowfly is through the buccal cavity. Plentiful extracellular mucilage was seen around the hyphae on ticks, and crystals of calcium oxalate were seen amongst the hyphae on the surface of ticks and in the haemolymph of blowflies killed by M. anisopliae isolate ARIM16. It was considered that cattle ticks are more suited for control with fungal biopesticides than adult blowflies. Three field trials were conducted over twelve months to assess the pathogenicity of M. anisopliae to parasitic stages of R. microplus on dairy heifers under different environmental conditions. Two isolates were selected based on their high optimal growth temperature (30oC), good conidial production characteristics and ability to kill adult engorged ticks in the laboratory in minimum time. Conidia were formulated in an oil emulsion and applied using a motor driven spray unit. Surface temperatures of selected animals were monitored, as were the ambient temperature and relative humidity. Unengorged ticks sampled from each animal immediately after treatment were incubated under laboratory conditions to assess the efficacy of the formulation and application. Egg production by engorged ticks collected in the first 3 days after treatment was monitored. Side counts of standard adult female ticks were conducted daily, before and after treatment to assess the performance of the fungus against all tick stages on the animals. At each trial the formulation caused 100% mortality in unengorged ticks that were removed from cattle and cultured under laboratory conditions. A significant reduction in egg production was recorded for engorged ticks collected in the three days post treatment. In the field, the fungal formulation had an inconsistent effect on ticks, which might be due to the influence of environmental temperature and humidity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metarhizium anisopliae, biopesticide, livestock ectoparasites, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Lucilia cuprina (cattle tick, sheep blowfly)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184229</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AUXIN AND STRIGOLACTONE IN THE CONTROL OF ARABIDOPSIS SHOOT BRANCHING</field><field name="creator">Alice Hayward</field><field name="description">Diversity in plant architecture is largely generated by the post-embryonic regulation of meristem initiation and activity. In a phenomenon known as apical dominance, the active growth of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) exerts significant inhibitory force on the outgrowth of axillary meristems (AMs) into shoot branches. The degree of branching in plants is a determinant of yield in many crop species and is carefully regulated to ensure that plants only branch at specific stages of development or in response to their environment. Apical dominance has been attributed to the action of the hormone auxin, produced in SAM tissues and transported downwards. A second hormone, cytokinin, acts antagonistically to auxin to promote branching. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism by which these hormones operate is still being elucidated and continued research suggested that novel signals are involved. The recent discovery that strigolactones, previously implicated in parasitic weed germination and mycorrhizal associations, are branching inhibitors supports the existence of additional signals controlling branching in plants. In garden pea (Pisum sativum) strigolactones are synthesised by the coordinated action of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) family enzymes, RMS1 (RAMOSUS1) and RMS5. These are encoded by MAX4 (MORE AXILLARY GROWTH4) and MAX3 in Arabidopsis thaliana respectively. Mutants for MAX genes have increased amounts of auxin travelling in the polar auxin transport stream (PATS) of inflorescence stems but exhibit increased branching that is insensitive to inhibition by this auxin. Two hypotheses for the action of strigolactones have been presented. The first is that strigolactones modulate the levels of auxin transport proteins, preventing axillary buds from establishing an active auxin transport flow into the primary stem, which inhibits growth. The second is that strigolactones act downstream of auxin signalling to inhibit the action of outgrowth-promoters. Consistent with this latter hypothesis, in pea, rice (Oryza sativa) and petunia (Petunia hybrida), the expression of RMS1/MAX4 orthologues is auxin regulated. These genes are also regulated by feedback signalling in strigolactone pathway mutants and this is proposed to involve an additional novel signal. In Arabidopsis, however, research showed that MAX4 is not regulated by feedback or auxin in the shoot and placed doubt on the importance of this regulation for branching control. The strigolactone biosynthetic pathway offers a novel target for the manipulation of plant architecture and yield while controlling the germination of parasitic weed species that are detrimental to agriculture. Therefore, a greater understanding of the pathway and its regulators is beneficial. The majority of the research in this thesis pre-dates the discovery of strigolactones as the RMS/MAX-derived branching inhibitor, yet aimed to clarify the evolutionary conservation and functional importance of the regulation of strigolactone biosynthetic genes by auxin and feedback signalling in Arabidopsis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that MAX3 and MAX4 are co-ordinately and systemically regulated by auxin and by feedback throughout development. Both auxin and feedback regulation required the AXR1/TIR1 auxin response pathway, which targets Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors for proteasomal degradation. In particular, correct degradation of the Aux/IAA protein IAA12 appears to be necessary for optimal MAX3 and MAX4 expression. Moreover this regulation affects strigolactone-dependent branching inhibition. Therefore it is proposed that auxin inhibits branching, in part, by positively regulating strigolactone synthesis. As feedback requires AXR1, this also suggests that increased auxin level and/or signalling in the PATS in conditions of reduced strigolactone signalling mediates feedback regulation of the strigolactone pathway. Consistent with this, microarray analysis revealed that in addition to the inflorescence, max mutants have increased global auxin-responsive gene expression associated with the PATS in the vegetative stage. The pea RMS1 gene was the first strigolactone pathway gene demonstrated to be auxin-regulated. Sequencing of the RMS1 promoter and comparative bioinformatic analysis with promoters of other strigolactone synthesis genes revealed a number of conserved, putative regulatory cis-elements that could mediate this regulation and cross-talk with additional branching cues. However a 2.5 kb fragment of the RMS1 promoter was not sufficient to drive transcriptional and translational fusions with GFP and the RMS1 coding region in Arabidopsis. The RMS1 coding region driven by the CAMV 35S promoter complemented the max4 mutant but did not affect branching induced by auxin-depleting treatments. Grafting studies with axr1 and iaa12 mutants, and decapitation and auxin-transport inhibition in max4 mutants, demonstrated that auxin signalling has a function in branching control independent from the regulation of strigolactone synthesis genes. Overall, data obtained herein was incorporated into current models for the interaction of the strigolactone pathway with auxin and cytokinin in the control of shoot branching. It is suggested that both strigolactone and auxin have the capacity to regulate the levels or distribution of each other in interlocking feedback loop that intersects with additional developmental, physiological and environmental cues for the precise control of axillary branching in plants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MAX</field><field name="subject">RMS</field><field name="subject">BODENLOS/IAA12</field><field name="subject">Branching</field><field name="subject">Auxin</field><field name="subject">Strigolactone</field><field name="subject">Cytokinin</field><field name="subject">Pea</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis</field><field name="subject">Transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184528</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTERGENERATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSFERS: FILIPINO MIGRANTS CARING FOR PARENTS OVERSEAS</field><field name="creator">Iris Lazzarini</field><field name="description">Abstract Recent estimates are that migrants send approximately US$300 billion in financial remittances from developed to developing countries annually and that such money is important at the micro and macro levels in relieving family poverty. As a migrant-receiving country with a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population, Australia has many migrants from developing countries who are part of this phenomenon. Little is known, however, about the purposes for which migrants send money home, the role it plays in intergenerational care and the perceptions of the impact of these payments on the recipients and on their own families in Australia. This study has a specific focus. It is interested in understanding the financial support provided to aged relatives in developing countries from Australian citizens. The term intergenerational financial transfers (IFTs) is used to distinguish money sent overseas by migrant adult children to parents or older relatives from general remittances. In Australian government accounting systems, remittances, or money sent to the home country by migrants, is collected as aggregate data, and it is therefore not possible to obtain a statistical understanding of how much money is being sent for specific purposes. This thesis explores the practice of making IFTs within one group of Australian citizens - Filipino migrants. Filipinos are one of the more numerous recent groups migrating to Australia from within its own geographic region, are known to send IFTs home, and are known to have good English skills that will facilitate research participation. The exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with a purposive, cross-sectional sample of 20 permanent Filipino migrants (10 female and 10 male). The interviews explore participants&#8217; current practices of sending money home to older relatives, the influences and motivation to send money over the life cycle, and the perceptions of the impacts of the practice on themselves and recipients. A thematic analysis of the transcribed data shows that sending money home is not only a migrant activity, since more than half the participants sent money home to parents before migrating to Australia. It also shows that this sample did not migrate to Australia primarily to make remittances, but for some, migration made it possible to do so. Cultural factors were the main motivation for making IFTs, followed by socio-economic circumstances of parents, and family values. No participant would consider abandoning their commitment and those who experienced difficulty in making IFTs over the life cycle were prepared to sell items or take out loans to continue their practice. The data analysis also showed that as well as females sending on average $500 per annum and males $1,000 per annum as cash or cheques through agents or banks, participants also purchased other one-off items, and sent substantial amounts of money for various emergency situations. Participants provided other forms of caregiving including practical care, gave ongoing psychological and emotional support, and sent large packages of goods home, thereby assisting parents with a wider variety of personal caregiving. On occasion participants co-operated with their siblings to provide a wider framework of family caregiving for their parents. IFTs are an important component of support for older people in many developing countries, and are made without expectation of financial return. The data showed that the practice of making IFTs was problematic for some participants at different stages of the life cycle. Because of the strong cultural values and obligations underpinning the practice, participants sometimes felt pressure to make IFTs from potential savings when, for example, school-age family expenses were high and had to be met; some women in their intercultural marriages who were unable to meet IFTs from their own earnings as their preferred option had to negotiate IFTs from household income. The thesis builds knowledge in the area of intergenerational financial transfers, transnational families and transnational caregiving for older people. It also adds depth to the understanding of the caregiving responsibilities and commitments to older people of some Australian citizens. This research adds an understanding of the practice of one group of migrants who send money home to ageing parents in the 21st century. It provides insight into current processes and practices and points to areas of policy where migrant Australian citizens might receive greater recognition for observing cultural obligations to care for parents and older relatives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">intergenerational financial transfers</field><field name="subject">migrant</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">remittances</field><field name="subject">caregiving</field><field name="subject">parents and older relatives</field><field name="subject">influences and motivation</field><field name="subject">socio-economic conditions</field><field name="subject">impacts</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184500</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affect and Performance: A Multilevel Analysis of Moderators and Mediators</field><field name="creator">Elisha Frederiks</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the intra-individual relationship between state affect and task performance, with an emphasis on a) the moderating effects of trait affect and task difficulty; and b) the mediating effects of cognitive and affective regulation. Theory and empirical research from the emotion, motivation, and personality literatures was integrated to develop a multilevel model of states, traits, and situational factors as predictors of task performance. Data from five studies were analysed using single- and multi-level techniques to test the hypothesised model of relationships. The findings are reported within three manuscripts, which comprise the body of this thesis. Manuscript 1 presents validation evidence for the psychometric instruments used to measure the self-regulatory components of the model. Three studies (N = 758) were conducted to examine the nomological network of cognitive and affective regulation. In parallel, two new self-report scales were developed to operationalise these constructs within a repeated measures paradigm. The three studies demonstrated that the new cognitive and affective regulation scales were uniquely associated with other self-regulatory, personality, affective and achievement variables at the intra-individual and inter-individual levels. Study 1 provided evidence for the unidimensionality, internal consistency, and construct validity of each scale. Study 2 replicated and extended construct validity evidence using a different sample and performance domain. Study 3 established the utility of each scale for assessing intra-individual variability in cognitive and affective regulation, and their ability to predict performance within individuals. In sum, the three studies suggested that the new measures of cognitive and affective regulation were psychometrically adequate for use in model testing. Manuscripts 2 and 3 tested the intra-individual relationship between state affect and task performance, with a focus on the moderating effects of trait affect and task difficulty (Manuscript 2), and the mediating effects of cognitive and affective regulation (Manuscript 3). Each manuscript analysed different portions of data from two laboratory experiments (N = 182). In each experiment, participants performed multiple trials of an air-traffic control simulation that varied in task difficulty at the inter-individual (Study 4) or intra-individual (Study 5) level. Trait positive and negative affect were measured before the task, whereas state positive and negative affect, cognitive and affective regulation, and task performance were measured at repeated intervals over practice. In Manuscript 2, hierarchical linear modelling demonstrated that state positive affect was positively related, whereas state negative affect was negatively related, to task performance at the intra-individual level of analysis. As hypothesised, the strength of these affect-performance relationships was significantly moderated by trait affect and task difficulty. In both studies, the positive intra-individual relationship between state positive affect and performance was stronger for individuals with high (versus low) trait positive affect, particularly when task difficulty was high (versus low). In contrast, the negative intra-individual relationship between state negative affect and performance only emerged for individuals with low (versus high) trait negative affect, regardless of the level of task difficulty. In Study 4, the intra-individual relationship between state negative affect and task performance was also more pronounced when task difficulty was high (versus low). In Manuscript 3, multilevel multiple-mediation modelling demonstrated that cognitive regulation significantly mediated the intra-individual relationship between state positive affect and performance in both studies, alongside the intra-individual relationship between state negative affect and performance in Study 4. Unexpectedly, affective regulation failed to mediate either of these affect-performance relationships. However, state positive affect was positively related to affective regulation in both studies, whereas state negative affect was positively related to affective regulation in Study 5. Overall, this thesis makes theoretical, empirical and methodological contributions to understanding how affect relates to performance at the intra-individual level of analysis; and for whom, when, and why these relationships emerge. Within a multilevel framework, it integrates interdisciplinary perspectives to identify the affective determinants of performance from two levels of analysis. The results demonstrate that state positive and negative affect can differentially predict intra-individual variability in task performance, and that these effects may a) depend on trait affect and task difficulty; and b) be partially explained by cognitive regulation. These findings emphasise the importance of adopting a multilevel, repeated measures paradigm to examine how affective states, traits, and task demands interactively predict task performance. There is scope for extending this research further by investigating a broader range of moderating and mediating constructs. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">affect, task performance, self-regulation, cognitive regulation, affective regulation, task difficulty, multilevel analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184578</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSMENT OF LOCATIONAL MARGINAL PRICE SCHEMES FOR TRANSMISSION CONGESTION MANAGEMENT IN A DEREGULATED POWER SYSTEM</field><field name="creator">Muhammad Bachtiar Nappu</field><field name="description">The growth of electricity markets around the world has introduced new challenges in which one of the challenges is the uncertainty that has become a structural element in this new environment. Market players have to deal with it to guarantee the appropriate power system planning and operation as well as its own economical liquidity. Under an open access environment in a deregulated power system, transmission management holds a vital role in supporting transactions between suppliers and customers. Nevertheless, a transmission network has some constraints that should be addressed in order to ensure sufficient control to maintain the security level of a power system while maximizing market efficiency. The most obvious drawback of transmission constraints is a congestion problem that becomes an obstacle of perfect competition among the market participants since it can influence spot market pricing. The system becomes congested when the supplier and customer agree to produce and consume a particular amount of electric power, but this can cause the transmission network to exceed its thermal limits. Congestion can cause the market players to exercise market power that can result in price volatility beyond the marginal costs. Thus, it is important to manage congestion efficiently in the design of a power market. One mechanism that has direct correlation with transmission management is market clearing price (MCP). Under an open access environment, energy prices throughout the network will be different and measured based on transmission constraint and network losses. When network losses are ignored and there is no congestion on the transmission lines, the power price will be the same at all nodes. This is known as uniform marginal pricing (UMP). However, as the power flow violates transmission constraints, redispatching generating units is required and this will cause the price at every node to vary. This phenomenon is defined as locational marginal pricing (LMP). Therefore, the market clearing price has a strong relationship with transmission management, which is needed to be assessed in order to obtain an efficient and transparent price but satisfying all market participants. This project investigates an alternative solution to the dispatch mechanism, and then formulates a new Locational Marginal Price scheme using optimization technique that may well control congestion as the main issue. The model will vary and be improved, to be distilled into energy price, congestion revenue, cost of losses, as well as transmission usage tariff. The objective of the project is to support developing standard market design (SMD) in managing transmission systems which promotes economic efficiency, lowers delivered energy costs, maintains power system reliability and mitigates exercising market power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economic Dispatch</field><field name="subject">Optimal Power Flow</field><field name="subject">Electricity Market</field><field name="subject">Transmission Congestion</field><field name="subject">Deregulated Power System</field><field name="subject">Locational Marginal Prices</field><field name="subject">Transmission Lines</field><field name="subject">Transmission Usage Tariff</field><field name="subject">Transmission Losses</field><field name="subject">Transmission Management</field><field name="subject">Transmission Congestion Management</field><field name="subject">Energy Prices</field><field name="subject">Nodal Pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184577</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Property Topology Optimisation with the Level-Set Method</field><field name="creator">Vivien Joy Challis</field><field name="description">We present a level-set algorithm for topology optimisation and demonstrate its capabilities and advantages in a variety of settings. The algorithm uses discrete element densities so that interpolation schemes are avoided and the boundary of the design is always well defined. A review of the level-set method for topology optimisation, and a description of the mathematical concepts behind the level-set algorithm are given in the introductory chapters. A compact Matlab implementation of the algorithm provides explicit implementation details for the simple example of compliance minimisation with a volume constraint. The remainder of the thesis presents original results obtained using the level-set algorithm. As a new application, we use topology optimisation to maximise fracture resistance. Fracture resistance is assumed to be related to the elastic energy released by a crack propagating in a normal direction from parts of the boundary that are in tension. We develop a suitable fracture resistance objective functional, derive its shape derivative and apply the level-set algorithm to simple examples. Topology optimisation methods that involve intermediate density elements are not suitable to solve this problem because the boundary of the design is not well defined. Our results indicate that the algorithm correctly optimises for fracture resistance. As the method is computationally intensive, we suggest simpler objective functionals that could be used as a proxy for fracture resistance. For example, a perimeter penalty could be added to the compliance objective functional in conjunction with a non-linear elasticity law where the Young's modulus in tension is lower than in compression. The level-set method has only recently been applied to fluid flow problems. We utilise the level-set algorithm to minimise energy dissipation in Stokes flows in both two and three dimensions. The discrete element densities allow the no-slip boundary condition to be applied directly. The Stokes equations therefore need only be solved in the fluid region of the design: this results in significant computational savings compared to conventional material distribution approaches. In order to quantify the computational savings the optimisation problems are resolved using an interpolation scheme to simulate the no-slip boundary condition. This significant advantage of the level-set method for fluid flow problems has not been noted by other authors. The algorithm produces results consistent with those obtained by other topology optimisation approaches, and solves large-scale three dimensional problems with modest computational cost. The first examples of three dimensional periodic microstructure design with the level-set method are presented in this thesis. The level-set algorithm is extended to deal with multiple constraints. This is needed so that materials can be designed with symmetry requirements imposed on their effective properties. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, unit cells are designed separately to maximise conductivity and bulk modulus with an isotropy requirement. The resulting materials have properties very close to the relevant Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. The algorithm is then applied to multifunctional material design: unit cells are designed to give isotropic materials that have maximum bulk modulus and maximum conductivity. Cross-property bounds indicate the near-optimality of the microstructures obtained. The design space of the problem is extensively explored with different coefficients of the conductivity and bulk modulus in the objective and different volume constraints. We hypothesise the existence of theoretically optimal single-scale microstructures with the topologies of the computationally optimised microstructures we have found. Structures derived from the Schwartz primitive (P) and diamond (D) minimal surfaces have previously been presented as good multifunctional composites. These structures are elastically anisotropic. Although they have similar conductivity, they have stiffness properties inferior to several of the isotropic optimised microstructures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">topology optimisation</field><field name="subject">level-set method</field><field name="subject">material design</field><field name="subject">fracture</field><field name="subject">elasticity</field><field name="subject">conductivity</field><field name="subject">Stokes flow</field><field name="subject">shape derivatives</field><field name="subject">topological derivatives</field><field name="subject">Matlab</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184547</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl without hands: extract from the manuscript of a novel. The Maiden without hands: from folktale and fairy ale to contemporary novel</field><field name="creator">Melissa Ashley</field><field name="description">The Girl without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel By Melissa Jane Ashley Abstract The major component of the thesis is an extract from the manuscript, The Girl without Hands, a novelised interpretation of the folktale and fairy tale, The Maiden without Hands. The novel is composed of three books, with point of view structured as shifting third person; most of the story is narrated by the central character, Marina Fischer. The manuscript deploys a variety of fairy tale and folktale related literary techniques, including magic realism, intertextuality, framing, and fantasy. Events span a period of eight years, the action set in rural and urban parts of Queensland and Victoria. On an unsupervised picnic with friends, fourteen year old Marina Fischer&#8217;s twin sister Sonia suffers a fatal head injury. Grief-stricken and self-blaming, Marina reacts to the trauma by losing all feeling and movement in her hands. Six months following the accident, Marina seems on the verge of recovery; she attends regular therapy and is protected by her loyal friends, siblings Amelia and Sammy Jones. However, the patina of stability begins to crack when Marina is confronted at the year ten formal by Sonia&#8217;s former associates, Kylie Bates and Jody Cutter, also present at her death. Distraught and upset, Marina flees the dance in Jody&#8217;s older brother&#8217;s car. Seven years later Marina meets Matt Soverign, a gifted hypnotist, who tries to help her regain movement in her hands. They sleep together and Marina unexpectedly falls pregnant. Their son Tristram is born while Matt attends an interstate conference. Thinking a child would help her hands to heal, Marina becomes depressed when she continues to suffer from paralysis. She begins to dwell on memories of her sexual assault the night of the school dance, slowly losing touch with reality. But a phone call from her estranged friend, Amelia Jones, shakes Marina out of her stasis. Her close mate Sammy, who now lives in Melbourne, has fallen dangerously ill. With her relationship in pieces, Marina purchases train tickets for herself and Tristram and embarks upon a spontaneous&#8212;though much delayed&#8212;journey to reconcile the past. The critical component of the thesis is an essay entitled &#8220;The Maiden without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel&#8221;. Chapter one, &#8220;The Tale is Not Beautiful if Nothing is Added to It,&#8221; is a literary survey of cross-cultural folktale and fairy tale variants of the 1200 year old narrative, The Maiden without Hands. I explore academic debate regarding the literary fairy tale&#8217;s indebtedness to the oral folktale, discussing Susan Stewart&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;distressed text&#8217; and Lewis Seifert&#8217;s theory of &#8216;nostalgic recuperation.&#8217; Chapter two, &#8220;Then the Devil Will Take Me Away,&#8221; undertakes a close reading of the Grimm Brothers&#8217; influential but controversial 1857 re-write of The Maiden without Hands narrative. I suggest that Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s suppression of the &#8216;unnatural father&#8217; episode, found in the traditional folktale, aided the story&#8217;s survival in and beyond the nineteenth century, when such themes became taboo. I explore how the Grimms&#8217; aesthetic revisions of folk material&#8212;to make them appeal to a middle class audience, including children&#8212;helped proliferate stereotyped representations of females and femininity in classic fairy tales. These depictions, I argue, often cause ambivalence in contemporary female readers, however they also instigate creative revisionary projects (such as my own), which seek to explore the residual energy contained in fairy tale texts, while at the same time destabilising their sexual stereotyping. In the last chapter, &#8220;The Only Thing She Doesn&#8217;t Have is Arms,&#8221; I discuss how extensive research into the many incarnations of The Maiden without Hands altered my understanding of the narrative&#8217;s symbols, tropes and metaphors, leading to significant changes to the plot of my novel. Citing examples from my text, The Girl without Hands, and comparing and contrasting them with excerpts from variants of the folktale and fairy tale, I analyse my creative interpretation of The Maiden without Hands&#8217; major themes: loss and lack; sexual assault and violation; creativity and writing; and, finally, healing and wholeness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Fairy tale</field><field name="subject">Folktale</field><field name="subject">The Girl without Hands</field><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Novel</field><field name="subject">Conversion Disorder</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying the ecological values of brigalow regrowth for woodland birds: a hierarchical landscape approach</field><field name="creator">Michiala Bowen</field><field name="description">The conversion of native forests to pastures and crops is one of the most extensive causes of deforestation worldwide. Concomitant with agricultural landscape modification are the processes of habitat loss and fragmentation, which are major causes of species&#8217; extinctions, population declines and altered ecosystem functions. However, in many tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions, abandoned agricultural lands are reverting to regrowth or secondary forest, which represents an important opportunity for passive landscape restoration. Regrowth may be particularly important in highly modified landscapes, where the area of mature forest may be insufficient to support viable plant and animal communities without some form of restoration. Some studies of fauna populations in regrowth forest have found recovery of species richness within several decades, although recovery of species composition may take at least 100 years and some species may be permanently lost. While these findings are encouraging, they generally fail to account for the landscape context in which regrowth occurs and focus mainly on tropical forests. The aim of this thesis was to advance the understanding of fauna recovery in regrowth forests on abandoned agricultural land by: i) comparing woodland bird communities in a replicated chronosequence of semi-arid sub-tropical regrowth forests; and ii) quantifying how the ecological values of regrowth habitat vary among stand-, patch- and landscape-levels of ecological organisation. A review of 68 studies of fauna recovery in regrowth forests, revealed that current knowledge is limited by the predominance of studies conducted: in tropical rainforests; with minimal replication of sites; in landscapes within proximity of large tracts of relatively undisturbed mature forests; and with limited consideration of the influence of the spatial context on fauna recovery in regrowth forest. This study makes a significant contribution to understanding fauna recovery in regrowth forests by quantifying the recovery of estimated bird species richness to levels similar to mature forest, within a period of 30-60 years, in highly modified semi-arid agricultural landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. An ordination of the similarity in species composition among forest types also suggested that after 30-60 years regrowth bird communities are more similar to mature brigalow forest than the younger regrowth. This is important for the recovery of brigalow ecosystems, an endangered ecological community where regrowth is currently given minimal protection from further clearing. Comparisons of the importance of habitat attributes using model averaging and hierarchical partitioning of generalised linear models of the species richness of woodland birds showed that bird species richness was positively associated with patch age, and that stand-level factors such as grazing disturbance and the abundance of mistletoes (Amyema spp.) were also important. The spatial context of vegetation patches (size, shape and isolation) was equally important for bird species richness, with more species of woodland dependent, nectar/frugivores and non-ground foraging insectivores occurring in less modified landscape contexts, and the converse for generalist species, ground foraging insectivores and granivores. While a number of woodland dependent bird species known to be in decline in temperate woodlands of southern Australia were absent or rare in regrowth forests, several species (e.g., eastern yellow robin) also occupied regrowth habitats. This finding suggests that these more sensitive species may respond positively to landscape restoration through targeted retention of brigalow regrowth. The landscape-level amount of forest varied in importance among regrowth age classes and bird groups. In general, the amount and number of mature forest patches in the landscape were of lower importance than local attributes. However, the amount of mature forest and old regrowth (&gt; 30 years) in the landscape did have an important positive influence on the number of woodland bird species and species&#8217; abundance; suggesting that regrowth is making an important contribution to landscape recovery in the study area. Mistletoe abundance was strongly dependent on particular species of frugivores for seed dispersal (e.g., mistletoebird, spiny-cheeked honeyeater and painted honeyeater), and varied considerably among three sub-regions of the study area. In general, mistletoe abundance increased in linear patches and more highly modified landscapes but was also dependent on the abundance of seed dispersers and brigalow stand condition. These findings suggest that narrow linear patches in brigalow landscapes can have important conservation values for woodland birds. The study outcomes have important implications for research and management of regrowth vegetation, both within Australia and internationally. From an international perspective, the study highlights the need for greater consideration of the importance of regrowth forest in a landscape context for conserving and restoring fauna communities. From an Australian perspective, the study provides important baseline information for the conservation and management of woodland bird habitat in fragmented brigalow landscapes. Prior to this research, very little was known on the spatial ecology of woodland birds in the region. The study highlights the important conservation values of small and often linear mature brigalow patches for woodland birds and the considerable potential for restoration of habitat for a diverse range of species through the retention of regrowth vegetation. In particular, the research outcomes suggest that targeting the retention of regrowth towards increasing the size and reducing the isolation of mature brigalow forests may be an effective strategy to maximise biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth stands will need to be retained for at least 60 years and probably longer to maintain viable woodland bird communities. For this to happen on a regional-scale, brigalow regrowth needs to be given greater recognition for potential biodiversity benefits either within a legislative framework or by incentive schemes to promote the long term persistence of regrowth habitat within the landscape.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">land abandonment</field><field name="subject">Regrowth</field><field name="subject">fauna recovery</field><field name="subject">woodland birds</field><field name="subject">agricultural landscape</field><field name="subject">Habitat Loss</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">spatial pattern</field><field name="subject">Acacia harpophylla</field><field name="subject">brigalow</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184589</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of SerpinB2 in tumour cells</field><field name="creator">Lee Major</field><field name="description">SerpinB2 (aka plasminogen activator type 2) is well described as an extracellular inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). However, the majority of SerpinB2 is retained intracellularly, and many uPA-independent activities have been reported for SerpinB2 suggesting an alternate function. This thesis explores the role of SerpinB2 in epithelial tumour cell lines, highlights the problems associated with various expression systems and argues that SerpinB2 has no role in growth or apoptosis of tumour cells. A potential role for immune modulation and angiogenesis is suggested in in vivo models. Previous research using SerpinB2 transfected, clonally selected tumour cell lines suggested that SerpinB2 regulates the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (Rb) by binding and protecting Rb from degradation. Despite the use of two techniques under numerous conditions and positive controls, no significant interaction between SerpinB2 and Rb was found. SerpinB2 was reported to bind Rb through a PENF homology motif located within the SerpinB2 C-D interhelical loop region. The PENF homology motif was postulated to represent the motif responsible for binding to the C-pocket of Rb. Epstein Barr Virus nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA6) is a known Rb binding protein, which contains two predicted PENF homology motifs. However, mutation of the two PENF homology motifs within EBNA6 did not reduce Rb binding. Furthermore, the SerpinB2 PENF homology motif is actually not well conserved between SerpinB2 proteins from multiple species, whereas other regions of the SerpinB2 C-D loop show a high level of conservation. These data do not support a role for SerpinB2 and the PENF homology motif in Rb binding. SerpinB2 has been proposed to have a role in regulating growth and apoptosis. To further investigate this proposed phenotype of SerpinB2, SerpinB2 was expressed in a range of epithelial tumour lines using transient transfection. No change in growth, apoptosis or Rb levels were found. After &#8776;2-3 month antibiotic selection for the SerpinB2-expressing plasmid, SerpinB2 protein was lost without the loss of the transgene, indicating selective pressure against long-term SerpinB2 protein expression. To further investigate long-term SerpinB2 expression adenovirus and lentivirus vectors were used. Infection of tumour cell lines with adenovirus vectors expressing SerpinB2 resulted in reduced cell growth, characterised by increased p53 (but not Rb) levels and G2 arrest or apoptosis. When SerpinB2 expressing lentivirus vectors were used to transduce the same tumour cell lines, high levels of long-term expression of functional SerpinB2 was achieved. However, SerpinB2-expressing cell lines showed no differences in growth, proliferation, Rb levels, or apoptosis induced by a range of agents. Growth and apoptosis observed with adenovirus SerpinB2 had all the characteristics of adenovirus-associated toxicity, which has been reported previously for specific proteins. These experiments highlighted the problems associated with SerpinB2 expression systems and suggest that SerpinB2 expression per se is not toxic nor has a role in regulating Rb, growth and apoptosis. Screening of a number of tumour cell lines identified the HPV16 transformed cervical cancer line as expressing high levels of SerpinB2. SerpinB2 was located both extracellularly and intracellularly with a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. A high molecular weight SerpinB2 species was identified in CaSki cells and was shown to be the N-linked glycosylated species. Sequencing showed the protein to be Type A SerpinB2 and the protein was shown to form an inhibitory complex with uPA. An abundant low molecular weight SerpinB2 species was also identified in CaSki cell supernatants and appeared to be a proteolytic fragment of SerpinB2. Treatment of CaSki with PMA, TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; increased SerpinB2 levels. Lentiviral based shRNA failed to significantly down regulate SerpinB2 expression and increasing SerpinB2 levels with lentiviral expression did not change growth, apoptosis, Rb levels or E7 transcription. Lentiviral expression of SerpinB2 in (normally SerpinB2 negative) HPV16 transformed SiHa cells, also failed to show changes in Rb levels or E7 transcription. CaSki thus express wild-type and functional SerpinB2, but no evidence could found that SerpinB2 effects HPV16 E7 transcription or Rb levels. The data presented identifies CaSki as valuable source of biologically functional SerpinB2. SerpinB2 expression in breast cancer cells has been associated with positive prognosis. Tubo, a SerpinB2-negative murine breast carcinoma cell line, was transduced with lentivirus expressing SerpinB2 and grown subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. SerpinB2 expressing tumours appeared red and were larger than control tumours. Furthermore, SerpinB2 expressing tumours had a &#8776;2 fold higher density of blood vessels when compared to Tubo and Tubo expressing EGFP. Mice carrying tumours expressing SerpinB2 also showed reduced anti-tumour IgG2 responses. These data suggest that a role for SerpinB2 in regulating angiogenesis and antitumour immunity. In conclusion, this thesis challenges the notion that SerpinB2 regulates Rb, cell cycle, and apoptosis and suggests a potential role for SerpinB2 in tumour angiogenesis and immunity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serpinb2</field><field name="subject">retinoblastoma protein</field><field name="subject">lentivirus</field><field name="subject">adenovirus</field><field name="subject">Human papilloma virus</field><field name="subject">th1</field><field name="subject">angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">caski</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184655</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of Grain storage protein digestibility in sorghum.</field><field name="creator">Phuong Mai Hoang</field><field name="description">Abstract Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the world&#8217;s fifth most common cereal crop and provides an important source of staple food in the semi-arid tropics and feed in many other countries. The plant has the ability to grow and yield in hot and dry climates. However, sorghum grain is less digestible than the other major staple crops such as rice, wheat and maize. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum grain by applying cutting-edge biotechnologies which involve the use of tissue culture and genetic transformation. Recently, Agrobacterium has been used by many researchers to introduce foreign genes into the sorghum genome. This method has some advantages compared to particle bombardment, however, one limitation is the regeneration of transgenic tissues. In this study successfully transformed sorghum using Agrobacterium and regenerated transgenic plants via an organogenic tissue culture system is reported. The results of transformation efficiency were achieved with co-cultivation after 48 hours. Regeneration of the sorghum transgenic plants was improved by using organogenic tissues. The GUS reporter gene and the Hpt and bar selectable markers were used. Southern blots and PCR were used to confirm transgene presence in the T0 and T1 generations. In this study, stable transgenic sorghum plants have been produced. The factors found to most influence Agrobacterium transformation were the type of organogenic tissue from different genotypes. The genotypes and the period of co-cultivation, as well as the selectable marker gene and selection strategy used. However, the transformation efficiency from this method was low (1.12%) compared with the previous efficiencies published for Agrobacterium-mediated sorghum transformation. Therefore, to improve the transformation efficiency for this method further work may need to be done. Thioredoxin genes were transformed into the sorghum genotype 296B by particle bombardment. In the first experiment no transgenics over-expressing trx and ntr were confirmed by Southern blot. In subsequent experiments, a limited number of transgenics of the T1 generation were confirmed and used for further analysis. A transgenic line with both trx &amp; ntr was created by crossing a trx line and a ntr line. The 2 genes in this line were confirmed and showed different levels of expression by Real Time PCR. Also, the level of expression in the T2 hybrid plants was higher compared to the T1 parents. The grains from the transgenic lines were different in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting properties and in-vitro digestibility. The ntr line was confirmed to be more digestible than the other transgenic lines and a non-transgenic line. There was a significant increase of 11% (P=0.02) in digestibility of the sorghum ntr line over the non-transgenic. However, the transgenic sorghum seeds did not germinate after storage for more than 6 months. Differences in the morphology of the starch granules and protein matrix of the transgenic lines when compared to non-transgenic were observed with Scanning Electron microscopy. The difference was observed from the transition to the central zone. Pores appeared in the starch granules of the sorghum transgenic lines, but not in the non-transgenic. This may be directly related to the changes in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting and digestibility. To find regulatory sequences which can direct expression of transgenes in developing endosperm, the &#946;-kafirin promoter was identified and cloned. Two constructs of varying length were made to test tissue specificity of the promoter, by replacing the Ubi promoter of the pUBIGUS vector. The GUS gene was used as the marker gene under the control of the amplified &#946;-kafirin promoter. The result was determined on different explants of sorghum by transient expression via particle bombardment. The result shows the successful identification of the &#946;-kafirin promoter region and its effect on transient expression levels. Agrobacterium transformation of sorghum organogenic tissue was developed. The digestibility of grain sorghum was improved by over-expressing the thioredoxin genes. In conclusion, the sorghum grain digestibility can be improved by transforming sorghum with thioredoxin genes, via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Further experimentation is required to identify regulatory sequences to optimise transgene expression in sorghum endosperm. In order to determine the reason behind the difficulties of seed germination, larger numbers of independent transgenic lines need to be generated and tested to determine whether over-expression of trx &amp; ntr always has detrimental effects on seed longevity and germination.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorghum transformation, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase over-expressed, Agrobacterium-mediated, organogenic tissue, &#946; -kafirin promoter.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184670</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Romanian Folk Music on the Music of George Enescu, with special reference to Romanian Rhapsody, op. 11 no. 1, Sonata for Violin and Piano, op. 25 no. 3, and Impression d&#8217;Enfance for Violin and Piano, op. 28.</field><field name="creator">Michael Patterson</field><field name="description">George Enescu (1881-1955) is the best-known Romanian composer and has been widely lauded for his folk- inspired compositions. While folk music was an important influence in Enescu&#8217;s music, it was always balanced by his passion for and intimate understanding of late Romantic compositional techniques. The extent to which he was influenced by the folk music of his homeland is a point of contention amongst some of the leading Enescu scholars. The English-speaking representative, Noel Malcolm believes that the influences in Enescu&#180;s musical language were more diverse than scholars have suggested prior to the 1989 revolution. He believes that the depiction of Enescu as a folkloristic composer has contributed to his marginalisation and relative obscurity. By contrast, scholars such as Boris Kotlyarov and Grigore Constantinescu give greater weight to national characteristics in Enescu&#8217;s music. Enescu conceded that some of his early works made direct quotation of Romanian folk melodies, and that such an approach was limited in its possibilities. The composer&#8217;s more mature works employ characteristics of folk music and its performance traditions without the use of direct quotation. This critical commentary will observe and comment on the folk influences in Enescu&#8217;s compositions as well as noting the influence of Western traditions and techniques. Due reference will be given to the work of Bart&#243;k, whose incisive study of Romanian folk music remains one of the most substantial and detailed primary sources today. In order to highlight specific examples of folk influence, as well as other techniques, three of Enescu&#8217;s works are targeted for specific study, namely the Romanian Rhapsody, op. 11 no. 1, Sonata for Violin and Piano, op. 25 no. 3 and his Impressions D&#8217;Enfance for violin and piano, op. 28. Each work exhibits a tie with the composer&#8217;s Romanian origins, but also with 19th and early 20thC composers such as Brahms, Wagner, Debussy and Faur&#233;. This critical commentary highlights the fact that Enescu&#8217;s works display folk idioms and techniques developed using late-Romantic techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enescu, folk, music, compositions, Romania, Romanian, composer, traditional, Bart&#243;k</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184703</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology Server for Ontology-based Interoperation of Information Systems</field><field name="creator">Mohammad Ahmad</field><field name="description">In order for information systems supporting two different organizations to interoperate, there must be an agreement as to what the words mean. Such an agreement is often called an ontology, or description of a shared world (a.k.a domain ontology). An ontology in general is an agreed understanding (i.e. semantics) of a certain domain, axiomatized and represented formally as logical theory in a computer resource. It can enable semantic interoperability where autonomous and distributed applications can meaningfully communicate to exchange data and interoperate independently of their internal technologies. The main goal of this thesis is twofold. First (general sense), it presents a specification for ontology engineering to guide ontology designers towards building ontology supporting interoperation of information system using a standard modeling approach. Second (specific sense), it presents a specification for what the ontology server is going to serve at commit-time. At this time, the server is used to assist players to obtain a portion of an ontology relevant to their interoperation requirement. First, we investigate the definition of an ontology as a specification of a conceptualization by showing that an ontology supporting interoperating information systems can be seen as the result of interlocking institutional worlds (IWs). An institutional world is the collection of integrated speech acts and consequent institutional facts made by a particular institution. This institutional world is the conceptualization of which the ontology is the specification. To be more specific, we call this ontology is a domain ontology of IWs. Second, we specify a software system, an ontology server needed to support domain ontology of IWs at commit-time for ontology engineering: 1) Commit-time requirements for an ontology server and 2) Ontology view extraction. The commit-time requirement is a functional requirement of the server to assist a player to obtain a relevant portion of an ontology. The discussion of this requirement has led to research into ontology view extraction. Based on the notion of formal ontology, our approach to ontology view extraction takes into accounts both endurants (entities that exist in time) and perdurants (entities that happen in time). Making a link to the domain ontology of IWs, the speech act is an example of event perdurant, while the institutional fact is an example of endurant. That is, our ontology view extraction involves perdurant ontology (ontology of speech acts) and endurant ontology (ontology of institutional facts). The principal contribution of this work is our technical solution for ontology view extraction. Based on an existing structural metamodel for modeling endurant ontology developed by Guizzardi, we present a technique using existential dependency for endurant extraction starting from a seed provided by the user. Since the user wants to commit to the ontology in order to interoperate with other players, the endurant seed is derived from the actions the user wants to perform, which are described in the perdurant ontology. Our metamodel for perdurant ontology is based on an existing business process metamodel for modeling speech acts, namely, Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The seed is the institutional facts involved in the speech acts the user wants to perform. These strategies have been implemented by extending with profiles the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Generally, the perdurant ontology is represented by the UML activity diagram, while the endurant ontology is represented by the UML class diagram. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we develop several collections of running examples based on an extended hypothetical ontology for the Olympic Games. This research is a contribution to the theory of conceptual modeling by proposing a set of specifications that can be used to model domain ontology of IWs. The specification here can be understood from two perspectives: 1) Metamodel and 2) Model. The former is addressed at meta-level which consists of metaconcepts for the languages in which the ontologies are represented. The latter is the resulting specification when these metaconcepts are used to represent some aspect of the reality or world in the domain of IWs. Most importantly, the work here contributes to the ontology server research since the view extraction based on the metamodel is what the server is going to serve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184677</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEGREES OF ASSOCIATION A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND WOMEN GRADUATES&#8217; ASSOCIATION, 1920 - 1979</field><field name="creator">Megan McCarthy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the history of the University of Queensland Women Graduates&#8217; Association (UQWGA) from 1920 to 1979. The association was established by a small group of women graduates in Brisbane in 1920, and from that time they maintained links with graduate women throughout Australia and internationally. These links were formalised in 1922 when the Australian Federation of University Women was formed and immediately affiliated with the International Federation of University Women. The UQWGA aimed to connect and support graduate women locally as well as promote the values of the IFUW which included international friendship and peace. The history of women&#8217;s organisations in Australia has attracted little scholarly attention. This thesis contributes to the growing body of research on the women&#8217;s movement from the end of World War I to the emergence of women&#8217;s liberation in the 1970s. The members of the UQWGA believed that through their university education they had developed the skills and knowledge to contribute to the betterment of society. University education had also instilled in them a sense of privileged that was a motivating factor in their mobilisation. The UQWGA provided a supportive and stimulating space for graduate women that encouraged their endeavours in professional and public life. The actions and approach of the UQWGA reflect those of other mainstream women&#8217;s organisation up to the mid-1960s. The organisation promoted its agenda through &#8216;polite lobbying,&#8217; utilising methods that were respectful of established systems and processes. The UQWGA established and maintained supportive relationships with other organisations, both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s, and with the University of Queensland. The association was primarily concerned with issues of the status and position of graduate women, but members felt that their contribution would also be valued in the wider community. This thesis aims to locate the work of the UQWGA in the context of the women&#8217;s movement in Australia, including how it reacted to the altering women&#8217;s movement of the 1970s when it changed its name to the Australian Federation of University Women &#8211; Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">AFUW</field><field name="subject">UQWGA</field><field name="subject">Graduate Women</field><field name="subject">Women's history</field><field name="subject">Australian history</field><field name="subject">Women's organisations</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184750</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent Training Programs for Parents of Teenagers</field><field name="creator">Raziye Salari</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a period of enormous adjustment for both teenagers and families. As children transition from childhood to adulthood, they go through many physical, emotional and behavioural changes. Not surprisingly, many parents describe adolescence as the most difficult and anxiety-provoking period of their children&#8217;s life. Parents&#8217; concerns are well justified, considering the high prevalence of emotional and behavioural problems during adolescence. Although health professionals and researchers share parents&#8217; view of adolescence as a challenging period of life, the scope of research on adolescents is scarce compared to research on children and adults. However, this is now changing. Research on adolescent development and adolescent psychopathology has increased dramatically during the last two decades. Reducing risk factors in adolescents&#8217; development has been receiving more and more attention both from researchers and policy makers. Family risk factors such as inadequate parental monitoring and family conflict are among potentially modifiable risk factors that can be targeted in order to reduce the rate of emotional and behavioural problems in adolescents. Behavioural family intervention is considered to be one of the promising intervention systems in this area because of the extensive empirical support it has received in research with families of preadolescence children. The research presented in this thesis focuses on parenting programs for parents of teenagers. The first study evaluates the efficacy of a behavioural family intervention (Triple P &#8211; Positive Parenting Program) targeting parents of teenagers. The second study explores factors which affect parents&#8217; decisions to participate in parenting programs. The first study outlines a randomised control trial (RCT), assessing the efficacy of a parenting intervention in reducing behavioural problems in adolescents. The study provides support for an intensive individual version of Teen Triple P &#8211; a behavioural family intervention designed specifically for parents of high risk adolescents. The intervention aims to improve adolescent behaviour by reducing parents&#8217; use of ineffective parenting. Participants were 46 families with a teenager aged 11 to 16. The outcomes of the intervention included a reduction in teen disruptive behaviours (d &gt; .85) and parent-adolescent conflict (d = .1.21), as well as decreased parental use of harsh and coercive parenting strategies (d = 1.15) and a decrease in parents&#8217; conflict over child rearing issues (d = .64). These positive changes were maintained at the three-month follow up. In spite of the growing recognition of parents&#8217; need for information, guidance and support during the crucial and challenging years of adolescence, little is known about the factors which affect parents&#8217; engagement in programs designed to help them in their parenting roles. The second study aimed to provide a conceptual framework for understanding parents&#8217; decisions to accept or decline participation in a parenting program by employing the Health Belief Model (HBM). The model suggested that parents are more likely to participate in a program when they (a) perceive their adolescents to be susceptible to development of problem behaviours, (b) perceive the problem behaviours to have serious consequences, (c) believe the parenting program to be beneficial in reducing the risk of development of problem behaviours in their adolescent, (d) perceive the personal, social and financial cost of attending the program to be low, and (e) are confident in their ability to successfully learn and apply what they learn in these programs. The model explained 31% of the variance in parents&#8217; inclination to participate in parenting programs. The study also showed that parents differ in their preferences of delivery format for parenting programs. These two studies contribute to the literature in a number of ways. Firstly, they demonstrate that parent training is an effective intervention in the treatment of adolescent problem behaviours. Secondly, they highlight the importance of addressing parents&#8217; beliefs and attitudes about the benefits of parenting programs as well as reducing participation barriers to encourage greater parental engagement in prevention and intervention programs. Finally, the research emphasises that in order to increase participation rate, parenting programs should be made available in a range of delivery formats. The implications of the current research and future directions are presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent behavioural problems</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">parent training programs</field><field name="subject">program engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184753</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategy for fatigue risk management at a mine site</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Adrian</field><field name="description">Fatigue in the minerals industry of Western Australia is a greatly under-recognised issue that has serious potential consequences for shift workers at work and at home. A review of fatigue literature demonstrates the elusive nature of fatigue. It is something that most people have probably experienced at some time in their lives. It is a diffuse sensation that is accompanied by feelings of lethargy and a lack of interest in any activity. A general sensation of weariness is a major symptom of fatigue. Fatigue cannot be measured directly and subjective estimates have to be relied upon. Potentially life threatening consequences can result when shift workers perform under the influence of fatigue. Fatigue and sleepiness have the power to kill if not treated with the respect they deserve. A cross-sectional survey of five underground mines was conducted to obtain a better understanding of their fatigue risk management strategies and the views of managers and shift workers on their sleep and shift schedules. Four mines provided information on their fatigue risk management procedures. Ten underground mining crews comprising 147 shift workers provided their views by an anonymous survey questionnaire administered at each mine at the start of shift. Shift worker sleep at the five mines compared well with mines in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland. However, it was found that frequently waking earlier than intended was the most widely reported sleep concern for shift workers on day shift, night shift and days off. Falling asleep while on day shift and on night shift demonstrates that fatigue is an issue that can occur on day shift as well as night shift. Fatigue is not an issue that is confined to night shift. Mine fitness for work procedures focused primarily on: shift schedules, hours of work and drug and alcohol issues. The level of detail provided on fatigue risk management was considered to be less than adequate when compared with the three previous issues and fatigue risk management documentation sourced from the minerals industry and the transport industry. The survey data and fitness for work procedures provided by four mines suggests that considerably more work needs to be done to recognise and address sleep quantity and quality, as well as sleepiness and fatigue experienced by shift workers while on shift and at home on rest days. There is a serious need for the Western Australian minerals industry to recognise the vital importance of sleep to shift workers during their shift schedule and rest days. There needs to be a concerted and on-going campaign by the industry to raise and maintain the awareness of sleep as a key element in fitness for duty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Risk Management</field><field name="subject">Mine</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">Shift Work</field><field name="subject">Occupational Health And Safety</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184921</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRANSNATIONALISM AND CHANGING PERCEPTION OF MIGRANCY: A CASE STUDY OF GREEK AND CYPRIOT IMMIGRANTS IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Ferdinand Brockhall</field><field name="description">This study investigates how immigration models of the post Second World War assimilation policy, subsequently replaced by the multiculturalism ideology, have been empirically perceived by Australian immigrants. Questions point to if modern day migrancy and immigration have transformed the ways in which the concepts are currently understood. Of particular interest is: are settlement, citizenship and assimilation an end point, or should migrancy be recast as a fluid phenomenon, privileged by greater freedom of &#8216;belonging&#8217; afforded by transnationalism? Answers to these questions fill gaps in sociological knowledge. The social research project is anchored in a case study of mainly first but not excluding second and a few third generation Greek and Cypriot Australian immigrant respondents. Data gathering employs qualitative inquiry, applying a Mixed Method approach grounded in the Grounded Theory Method. Fieldwork data are generated by in-depth interviewing of respondents, and interpretation of their statements. Their verbal testimonials are analysed using the conceptually clustered matrix. In this approach text is assembled, sub-clustered, and broken into semiotic segments, permitting the researcher to contrast, compare, analyse, and recognise patterns. The strength of employing the Conceptually Clustered Matrix is that it serves the &#8220;conceptual coherence&#8221; of the data in this study&#8217;s single case inquiry. This study reveals how transnationalism has changed presumptions embedded in the policies of assimilation and multiculturalism. In assimilation, supposition of permanent settlement, and the question of &#8216;belonging&#8217; has been resolved by the immigrants succeeding in effectively transplanting the former ethnic &#8220;I&#8221;, into becoming a new Australian &#8220;me&#8221;. Subsequent multiculturalism provides immigrants options in choosing their self-identity within the society at large and accepting that migrant minorities can subsist in discrete ethnic conglomerates clustered within the compass of wider Australian society. The contribution of this thesis to the body of sociological knowledge is that it investigated presently not or under-investigated scholarship how migrants perceive their diaspora existence, redefined by daily practices among migrants. In a transnational context, the research has focused on exploring post-immigration identity and &#8216;belonging&#8217;.

Data was elicited using an email production questionnaire consisting of four email situations, which vary along two social dimensions: relative power, either equal or higher, and size of imposition, either big or small. Four groups of participants, who were all university students, took part in the study. Thirty-seven Chinese native speakers of Mandarin and 35 Australian native speakers of English provided the baseline data. Thirty-five Chinese EFL learners at low proficiency level and 38 Chinese EFL learners at high proficiency level provided the target data. Altogether 580 emails were collected. Data was classified according to an adapted version of the coding scheme developed by Blum-Kulka et al. (1989). Email requests were analyzed at both the utterance and discourse levels. At the utterance level, directness level, strategy types and internal modifiers were examined. At the discourse level, external modifiers, including all the supportive moves in the opening, body, and closing of an email request were analyzed. Following Beebe et al. (1990), data was looked at in terms of the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were adopted. To determine evidence of pragmatic transfer, first, the Chinese baseline data and the English baseline data were compared. The EFL data was then compared with that of the two baseline groups. Pragmatic transfer was confirmed if the EFL data resembled the Chinese baseline data but differed from the English baseline data. In addition, the instances of pragmatic transfer displayed by the EFL groups at low and high proficiency levels were compared to examine the correlation between pragmatic transfer and language proficiency, that is, whether pragmatic transfer increases or decreases as learners&#8217; language proficiency increases. Pragmatic transfer was investigated on both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic levels. Findings of the present study show that pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic transfer occurred at the utterance and the discourse levels in all three areas: the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features, by both the low and high proficiency EFL learners. Moreover, a comparison of the performance of requests by the two learner groups indicates that the high proficiency learners had a greater amount of pragmatic transfer than the low proficiency learners. The findings of this study lend strong support to the positive correlation hypothesis proposed by T. Takahashi and Beebe (1987). The findings of the present study highlight the importance of the inclusion of pragmatic components in foreign language teaching. Pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed. Possible suggestions regarding how to improve the EFL learners&#8217; pragmatic competence are provided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">pragmalinguistic transfer</field><field name="subject">sociopragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">request</field><field name="subject">directness</field><field name="subject">indirectness</field><field name="subject">politeness</field><field name="subject">pragmatic failure</field><field name="subject">pragmatic competence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185047</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James V. Forrestal as Cold War Policymaker: A Re-Assessment</field><field name="creator">Belinda Lohrisch</field><field name="description">This thesis critically examines the career and significance of America&#8217;s first Secretary of Defence James V. Forrestal from a post-Cold War perspective. Within traditional Cold War scholarship, Forrestal&#8217;s legacy is problematic. The nature of his role as a defence administrator, combined with his suicide in 1949, has led scholars to underestimate his significance and relegate his legacy to the occasional biography. The few studies that examine his contribution utilise conventional analytical approaches that fail to fully assess his policymaking impact. The end of the Cold War, however, has brought additional insight into the policy concerns that dominated the conflict, new analytical approaches to its scholarship and fresh material on which to base a re-assessment. As this thesis demonstrates, the employment of new methodologies to study Forrestal&#8217;s impact is long overdue. By drawing on theories specifically related to leadership and decision-making behaviour, this thesis brings a deeper, fuller understanding of Forrestal&#8217;s policy-making impact as a Cold War official through an examination of his professional conduct. Despite Forrestal&#8217;s many successes, political controversies surrounding his defence career overshadowed his many achievements. This thesis argues that such controversies were the result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication as a public official, his policy-making and management styles, and the structure of his authority as defence secretary. They were not, as some have argued, the result of his ineffectiveness as a policy-maker, &#8220;hawkish&#8221; attitudes or declining mental health. His collapse, furthermore, was not the natural conclusion of any paranoid delusions or obsessive nature, but rather a result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication to his work at the expense of his own health. This thesis undertakes a content analysis of Forrestal&#8217;s writings and an examination of his policy-making approach, concentrating on the evolution and execution of his policy advice and initiatives, as well as the structure of his authority as secretary of defence. It begins with a biographical overview of his life and public service career, as well as an assessment of existing Cold War scholarship and its general tendency to underestimate Forrestal&#8217;s significance. The components of his legacy are then analysed thematically, with chapters devoted to his foreign policy influence, his role in the unification controversy and his administrative efforts as defence secretary. Throughout, Forrestal&#8217;s career and significance is reassessed both in the application of new theoretical and methodological insights, and the analysis of recently declassified and reorganised documents, particularly the complete and unexpurgated version of Forrestal&#8217;s official diaries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">james forrestal, cold war, policy-making, defence policy, defence administration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185150</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WHY ISN&#8217;T THAT CREEK FENCED OFF? A Study of Landcare, Intervention and Change in a Rural Landscape</field><field name="creator">Erlina Compton</field><field name="description">This study represents a quest to find answers to the complex problem of rural land degradation in Australia. Despite significant investment in environmental improvement programs and community based natural resource management interventions, the problem of land and water degradation continues. A key intervention in Australia has been the Landcare program, which has experienced much success in engaging a large sector of the rural population in addressing the problem. Additionally, the Australian Government has and continues to make significant investment in the Landcare program as well as directly to rural land managers through a range of extension and incentive mechanisms and increasingly through market-based instruments. Whilst financial, human and knowledge capital investment in such interventions appear to have an influence on their success, it is the social and cultural factors that seem to be a downfall. This study investigated this problem through a case study conducted in Gippsland, in the state of Victoria. Through a multi-methods approach guided by foundations of critical realism and influenced by grounded theory, this primarily qualitative study yielded rich insights into the inner workings of Landcare and the values, drivers and motivators of rural landholders and the institutional staff who work with them. Through five research cycles the study explored the health and function of 16 Landcare Groups; three examples of community-based projects which sought to improve Landcare group capacity and the views of 46 landholders and 31 institutional staff on values, drivers and intervention design. A sixth research cycle provided a synthesis of the findings of the first five cycles to develop a conceptual model of community intervention and change which was tested with a sample of the study&#8217;s informants. Emerging as key insights was the role that ownership, social capital and empowerment play in the success of group based community projects. On an individual level, values of landholders, including strong land ownership values and motivations are a key to practice change. This is also mediated by an individual&#8217;s access to various forms of capital to undertake farm management activities including altering practices towards environmental sustainability. The outcome of the study, the model of community intervention and change provide a series of critical &#8216;states&#8217;, &#8216;stages&#8217; and &#8216;transitions&#8217; to the process of individual and/or group change and empowerment. The study conclusions point out the complexities of the problem of land degradation when it is realised that the role of people is critical to its solution. The study provides insight into the essential components of interventions which are required to attain success.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">psychological ownership</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">rural community</field><field name="subject">Landcare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185210</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communicating across the urban-rural divide: How identity influences responses to sustainable land use campaigns.</field><field name="creator">Daniel Healy</field><field name="description">In recent years it has become widely accepted that the natural systems on which we depend for survival are being degraded by human activity. It is no longer a question of if we need to reduce our impact upon the planet, but of the extent to which we need to change our behaviour, and how soon we need to act. Such change will depend upon the support of voters, governments, and the international community and will require wide spread changes in attitudes and behaviour. Using the social identity approach as a framework, the current programme of research focuses on rural land users in Australia and the effectiveness of sustainable land use campaigns directed at them from both urban and rural sources. The studies provide a novel contribution to the area by demonstrating the effects of intergroup threat on group-based communication, in particular, the perception of threat to rural identity and the effect on urban and rural messages aimed at changing land use behaviour. Conclusions about broader social influence processes were also made by assessing rural participants&#8217; perceptions of the degree to which others are influenced. Although the studies are based in the context of rural Australian land users, the results and theoretical implications can be applied to any situation wherein one group is attempting to change the attitudes and behaviours of another group. This could range from local interest groups trying to convince each other of the merits of their ideas through to political parties and nations calling for united and decisive action on global issues. Such groups ignore issues of power and status at the risk of ineffective communications or even a backlash in opinion and behaviour. Six studies were conducted, including five survey studies with rural landholders and one experiment with students at a rural campus. Study 1 (N = 251) was an evaluation of sustainable land use campaigns in general, comparing those from urban sources to those from rural sources. Study 2 (N = 585) extended this by assessing the moderating role of intergroup threat perceptions. This study also measured the perceptions of influence of urban and rural messages on urban people and other rural people. Study 3 (N = 98) assessed the influence of an actual land use campaign delivered by an ingroup source on individuals&#8217; attitudes and behaviours and the perceived influence on others. Study 4 (N = 249) built upon Study 2 but included additional measures to address some of the inconsistencies between Studies 1 and 2. To address the psychological underpinnings of group-based influence, Study 5 (N = 124) included measures of trust in urban and rural sources as well as reports of influence, agreement, and past behaviour. To conclude, Study 6 (N = 64) provided an experimental test of persuasion by manipulating the source of the message. Self-reported identification and intergroup threat were examined as moderators of group-based persuasion. Furthermore, attributions of constructiveness were explored as a possible reason for the superior influence of ingroups. Across the six studies it was found that ingroup messages were consistently more influential than outgroup messages. Attributions of trust and constructiveness helped to explain the superior influence of ingroups. In terms of perceptions of influence on others, there was a third-person effect for urban messages but rural people did not differentiate between themselves and other rural people in response to rural messages. Furthermore, rural identification was associated with greater reported influence from the ingroup source and perceived threat was associated with increased influence of rural messages compared to urban messages. These findings have clear implications for attempts at changing attitudes between groups, particularly where there is a salient and competitive intergroup context. Outgroups operate at a distinct disadvantage in delivering persuasive communications, especially if ingroup identification is high or there is a perception of threat stemming from the communicating group. Evidence of the persuasiveness of ingroups compared to outgroups is further strengthened by the perceptions of similarity in influence of rural sources for self and other ingroup members. The findings on trust and constructiveness hint at the possibility of overcoming barriers to outgroup persuasion if positive motives for the messages can be established. Of course, this depends on the severity of the intergroup context and the nature of communication. Recommendations are made for a collaborative approach to achieving change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Persuasion</field><field name="subject">Intergroup Relations</field><field name="subject">sustainable land use</field><field name="subject">urban-rural divide</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185257</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Financial Reporting Conservatism and Discloure on the Cost of Equity Capital</field><field name="creator">Artiach, Tracy</field><field name="description">Financial reporting conservatism enjoys a long-standing place of prominence in accounting principles and practices. Its prevailing influence justifies the considerable attention conservatism has, and continues to receive in accounting research. A growing body of recent research suggests that, in time series, financial reporting has become more conservative. Whilst this evidence is intuitive on a number of levels, the notion of conservatism appears to be incongruent with the continual spate of corporate collapses that plague our financial world and the outward rejection of conservatism as a desirable qualitative characteristic of financial reporting by Australian and U.S. standard setters. Existing empirical research indicates that conservatism continues to be evident in accounting and serves a positive function in contracting efficiencies with evidence, inter alia, of conservatism mitigating agency conflicts and therefore reducing the cost of debt and improving corporate governance (Watts 2003a). However, little evidence exists regarding its economic consequences in terms of its impact on the cost of equity capital. This thesis empirically examines the relationship between conservatism and the cost of equity capital under a framework supported by Signalling Theory rather than Agency (Contracting) Theory, consistent with the theoretical propositions modelled by Gietzmann and Trombetta (2003) and Bagnoli and Watts (2005). The primary research question of this thesis explores the influence of conservatism on the cost of equity capital and thus asks if the firm&#8217;s decision to adopt conservative reporting practices has economic consequences. At the same time, research has seen a plethora of studies that investigate the capital market impacts of the firm&#8217;s disclosure policy. Existing empirical research provides evidence in part indicating that the cost of equity capital is reducing in disclosure levels, however, existing empirical research does not provide evidence on how conservatism and disclosure interact. Therefore, the second research question seeks to explore this interaction and investigates the conditional influence of disclosure on the primary relationship between conservatism and the cost of equity capital. Using a sample of U.S. listed entities for the period 1984 to 1994, this thesis investigates the individual (unconditional) and joint (conditional) impact of conservatism and disclosure on the cost of equity capital. The thesis makes several contributions. First, the findings provide considerable new evidence in support of the prediction that the cost of equity capital is decreasing in the level of conservatism. Consistent with the theoretical propositions in Gietzmann and Trombetta (2003) and Bagnoli and Watts (2005), it is argued that by signalling of firm quality through adoption of conservative reporting practices, firms have the ability to reduce non-diversifiable firm-specific information risk and hence will benefit from a resulting decrease in the cost of equity capital. Second, this thesis re-examines the relationship between disclosure and the cost of equity capital with evidence indicating that the cost of equity capital is decreasing in the disclosure level as measured by the comprehensive disclosure score. Third, this thesis explores new ground in its investigation of the interaction between conservatism and disclosure and their joint influence on the cost of equity capital. The findings provide considerable support for the prediction that the value of conservatism is diminished in environments of low information asymmetry (high disclosure). It is conjectured that because there is little private information in environments of low information asymmetry, there are no signalling benefits to be gained. Finally, the results provide consistent evidence of an inverse relationship between conservatism and disclosure. The findings suggest that conservatism and disclosure are therefore strategy substitutes in the overall reporting strategy. The findings of this thesis provide considerable support for the benefits of conservatism and provide a further explanation for the continued observation of conservatism evidenced in prior empirical research. Further, the findings provide support for the conjecture that conservatism and disclosure each have a role to play in the financial reporting strategy of the firm. Overall, the findings of thesis provide new evidence indicating that the firm&#8217;s decision to adopt conservative reporting practices has the potential to reap real economic benefit in terms of reduction in the cost of equity capital and that conservatism has a positive role in accounting principles and practices.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">conservatism</field><field name="subject">disclosure</field><field name="subject">cost of equity capital</field><field name="subject">quality signalling</field><field name="subject">firm-specific information risk</field><field name="subject">non-diversificable</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185259</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpretive and Source-Oriented Approaches: Modern Japanese Free Verse Poetry in English Translation</field><field name="creator">William Fryer</field><field name="description">This study examines two translation approaches prominent among English translations of modern Japanese free verse poetry. The purpose is twofold: to provide a critical history of the first book-length English translations of individual poets, published over roughly a ten-year period; and to identify and examine, among those publications, works that took a distinctive and challenging translation approach. The main argument is that the chief works examined in this study each present a differing approach that challenges the dominant postwar discourse on translation in the Japanese literary studies community. The study fills a conspicuous gap in translation studies, since it is the first in-depth examination of modern Japanese poetry in translation. It focuses on two translation approaches, specifically &#8220;interpretive&#8221; and &#8220;source-oriented&#8221; translation, which have tended to be loosely associated with the vague notions of &#8220;free&#8221; translation and &#8220;literal&#8221; translation respectively. The importance of the study stems from its clarified definitions of these approaches through analyses of published translations featuring their rigorous use. It also suggests arguments for and implications of using and identifying these approaches, both for the translator and for translation scholars. Modern poetry was chosen as a genre because it features the two approaches prominently and because it was felt important to focus on a genre somewhat marginalised among publications of Japanese literature in translation. The study focuses in particular on translations published in the period 1968-1978, because this represented a flowering period of publications of modern Japanese poetry, including the first book-length publications of individual poets. Chapter One has two parts: definitions and contexts. The definitions section is a brief discussion of translation theory focusing on views that have gone beyond the &#8220;literal&#8221; versus &#8220;free&#8221; argument, and it examines a number of significant statements in the field of translations studies in order to develop useful definitions of key terms used throughout the study. The second half contextualises the significance of the chosen publications in the Japanese literary studies community. This includes a brief history of translation and translation theory focusing on the views of the dominant translators in the early postwar years, including discussions, disagreements or criticisms concerning the &#8220;right&#8221; way to translate. It also includes an analysis of attitudes towards modern poetry among scholars and translators of Japanese literature and a brief discussion of translations of modern Japanese poetry. Chapter Two examines poet Gary Snyder&#8217;s interpretive and transformative translations of Miyazawa Kenji&#8217;s (1896-1933) poems &#8220;Haru to shura&#8221; (Spring and Asura) and &#8220;Nusubito&#8221; (The Thief). The chapter shows how Snyder&#8217;s renditions of these poems can be related to the structure and themes of his own poetry collection The Back Country (1968) in which the translations appeared. By throwing his interpretive reading of these poems into the translations, as well as making some creative adjustments, Snyder allows the translations to fit within the thematic movement of his own collection. This chapter also argues that the act of identifying interpretive approaches in the case of poet-translators can be an an important tool in establishing links between the translations and the poet&#8217;s original literary works, and even further links with the poet&#8217;s life and philosophy. Chapter Three examines Hiroaki Sato&#8217;s translations of Hagiwara Sakutar&#333; (1886-1942) in Howling at the Moon (1978). Sato takes an estranging, source-oriented approach similar to Lawrence Venuti&#8217;s concept of &#8220;foreignisation&#8221;, an approach that signals the difference of the source text and culture by departing from accepted language usage. With Sato&#8217;s translations we can observe the estranging effect of the source-oriented approach working in two directions: suggesting the difference of source text syntax from the target language perspective; and giving an equivalent effect of some unusual language use that was already estranging for source language readers. Sato sees the estranging function of Sakutar&#333;&#8217;s syntax as an essential element of his poetry, and has developed his whole translation strategy around this view. Chapter Four discusses Cid Corman and Kamaike Susumu&#8217;s translations of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems in frogs &amp;. others. (1969). As with Sato&#8217;s versions of Sakutar&#333;, Corman and Kamaike take a source-oriented approach, and their clever use of text selection and ordering as translation strategies has enabled them to convey their interpretation of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems as directing a defamiliarising gaze back at humans and human society. Rather than aiming for complete linguistic accuracy as Sato does, they focus on a mirror-image source-oriented approach&#8212;often reproducing the source text&#8217;s word order and line order&#8212;not only as a means to suggest Kusano&#8217;s syntax, but also as a form of language experimentation and wordplay that enables their translations to stand out as autonomous poetic texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">modern</field><field name="subject">free verse</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">Miyazawa Kenji</field><field name="subject">Hagiwara Sakutar&#333;</field><field name="subject">Kusano Shinpei</field><field name="subject">Literature in Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185287</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adult Oral Health Programme: The Effect of Periodontal Treatment and the Use of a Triclosan Containing Toothpaste on Glycaemic Control in Diabetics</field><field name="creator">Ohnmar Tut</field><field name="description">Adult Oral Health Programme: The Effect of Periodontal Treatment and the Use of a Triclosan Containing Toothpaste on Glycaemic Control in Diabetics Abstract Aim: The aim of the research study is to establish an adult oral health programme for diabetics in Majuro, Republic of the Marshall Islands in order to determine the impact of non-surgical periodontal treatment followed by the use of a triclosan containing dentifrice on the maintenance of periodontal health and glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. Hypothesis: Non-surgical periodontal treatment results in improved periodontal health and better glycaemic control in diabetics and use of a triclosan containing toothpaste is effective in maintaining this improvement in diabetics. Methods: An adult oral health programme was created, within which was conducted a two-group randomised clinical trial to address the hypothesis that non-surgical periodontal treatment results in improved periodontal health and better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetics and that the use of a triclosan containing toothpaste is effective in maintaining this improvement in diabetics. In this double blind controlled trial, sixty adult patients (aged 35 to 65 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus having a minimum of 16 teeth received non-surgical periodontal treatment. Half of the patients were randomly assigned to use a triclosan containing toothpaste, Colgate Total, and the other group a non-triclosan toothpaste, Colgate Fluoriguard. The study evaluated the improvement in periodontal health by recording Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) on 6 sites of each tooth, and the number of sites bleeding on probing (BOP) at baseline, and at 6 months and 12 months after treatment. The second part of the study evaluated the impact of improvement of periodontal health on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetics by measuring HbA1c and RBS, and also assessing the levels of C-Peptides and CRP at baseline, and at 6 months and 12 months after treatment. The study also evaluated the effectiveness of a triclosan containing toothpaste in maintaining the improvement in periodontal health after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Results: The results showed that it was feasible to establish an oral health programme for the diabetics and could improve their periodontal health, and that toothpaste containing triclosan is effective in maintaining the improved periodontal heath in type 2 diabetics. Mean PPD dropped from 2.35mm to 1.95mm in the triclosan group and from 2.49mm to 2.24 mm in the non-triclosan group and the mean number of BOP sites dropped from 4.9 to 2.8 in the triclosan group and from 4.7 to 3.2 in the fluoriguard at 12 month visits. However, the results did not show improvement of HbA1c nor RBS levels in either group. C-Peptide levels increased and C-Reactive Protein levels decreased in both groups, however, not to significant levels at 12 month visits. Conclusion: The results of this research study lead to the conclusion that treating periodontal infection has effect of periodontal health of type 2 diabetic patients and following-up with simple personal oral hygiene of regular tooth-brushing helps maintain their periodontal health. This programme also proved that this type of oral health programme is feasible and valuable for diabetics in isolated places like the Marshall Islands, where infrastructure, personnel and resources are limited to treat microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. As for the effectiveness of treating periodontal infections on glycaemic control of diabetics, this study failed to support the hypothesis that non-surgical treatment plus triclosan containing toothpaste would lead to better glycaemic management through improved periodontal health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Chronic periodontitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, oral health, triclosan, non-surgical periodontal treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185341</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Computational Methods for Power System Data Analysis in an Electricity Market</field><field name="creator">Ke Meng</field><field name="description">The power industry has undergone significant restructuring throughout the world since the 1990s. In particular, its traditional, vertically monopolistic structures have been reformed into competitive markets in pursuit of increased efficiency in electricity production and utilization. However, along with market deregulation, power systems presently face severe challenges. One is power system stability, a problem that has attracted widespread concern because of severe blackouts experienced in the USA, the UK, Italy, and other countries. Another is that electricity market operation warrants more effective planning, management, and direction techniques due to the ever expanding large-scale interconnection of power grids. Moreover, many exterior constraints, such as environmental protection influences and associated government regulations, now need to be taken into consideration. All these have made existing challenges even more complex. One consequence is that more advanced power system data analysis methods are required in the deregulated, market-oriented environment. At the same time, the computational power of modern computers and the application of databases have facilitated the effective employment of new data analysis techniques. In this thesis, the reported research is directed at developing computational intelligence based techniques to solve several power system problems that emerge in deregulated electricity markets. Four major contributions are included in the thesis: a newly proposed quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization and self-adaptive learning scheme for radial basis function neural networks; online wavelet denoising techniques; electricity regional reference price forecasting methods in the electricity market; and power system security assessment approaches for deregulated markets, including fault analysis, voltage profile prediction under contingencies, and machine learning based load shedding scheme for voltage stability enhancement. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) inspired by biological evolution mechanisms have had great success in power system stability analysis and operation planning. Here, a new quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed. Its inspiration stems from quantum computation theory, whose mechanism is totally different from those of original EAs. The benchmark data sets and economic load dispatch research results show that the QPSO improves on other versions of evolutionary algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy. Compared to the original PSO, it greatly enhances the searching ability and efficiently manages system constraints. Then, fuzzy C-means (FCM) and QPSO are applied to train radial basis function (RBF) neural networks with the capacity to auto-configure the network structures and obtain the model parameters. The benchmark data sets test results suggest that the proposed training algorithms ensure good performance on data clustering, also improve training and generalization capabilities of RBF neural networks. Wavelet analysis has been widely used in signal estimation, classification, and compression. Denoising with traditional wavelet transforms always exhibits visual artefacts because of translation-variant. Furthermore, in most cases, wavelet denoising of real-time signals is actualized via offline processing which limits the efficacy of such real-time applications. In the present context, an online wavelet denoising method using a moving window technique is proposed. Problems that may occur in real-time wavelet denoising, such as border distortion and pseudo-Gibbs phenomena, are effectively solved by using window extension and window circle spinning methods. This provides an effective data pre-processing technique for the online application of other data analysis approaches. In a competitive electricity market, price forecasting is one of the essential functions required of a generation company and the system operator. It provides critical information for building up effective risk management plans by market participants, especially those companies that generate and retail electrical power. Here, an RBF neural network is adopted as a predictor of the electricity market regional reference price in the Australian national electricity market (NEM). Furthermore, the wavelet denoising technique is adopted to pre-process the historical price data. The promising network prediction performance with respect to price data demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method, with real-time wavelet denoising making feasible the online application of the proposed price prediction method. Along with market deregulation, power system security assessment has attracted great concern from both academic and industry analysts, especially after several devastating blackouts in the USA, the UK, and Russia. This thesis goes on to propose an efficient composite method for cascading failure prevention comprising three major stages. Firstly, a hybrid method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and specific statistic measures is used to detect system faults. Secondly, the RBF neural network is then used for power network bus voltage profile prediction. Tests are carried out by means of the &#8220;N-1&#8221; and &#8220;N-1-1&#8221; methods applied in the New England power system through PSS/E dynamic simulations. Results show that system faults can be reliably detected and voltage profiles can be correctly predicted. In contrast to traditional methods involving phase calculation, this technique uses raw data from time domains and is computationally inexpensive in terms of both memory and speed for practical applications. This establishes a connection between power system fault analysis and cascading analysis. Finally, a multi-stage model predictive control (MPC) based load shedding scheme for ensuring power system voltage stability is proposed. It has been demonstrated that optimal action in the process of load shedding for voltage stability during emergencies can be achieved as a consequence. Based on above discussions, a framework for analysing power system voltage stability and ensuring its enhancement is proposed, with such a framework able to be used as an effective means of cascading failure analysis. In summary, the research reported in this thesis provides a composite framework for power system data analysis in a market environment. It covers advanced techniques of computational intelligence and machine learning, also proposes effective solutions for both the market operation and the system stability related problems facing today&#8217;s power industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Data Analysis</field><field name="subject">Machine Learning Methods</field><field name="subject">Online Wavelet Denoising</field><field name="subject">Particle Swarm Optimization</field><field name="subject">PSS/E Dynamic Simulation</field><field name="subject">RBF Neural Network</field><field name="subject">Voltage Stability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UNDERSTANDING SOCIO-CULTURAL RESILIENCE TO HOLIDAY TOURISM AND VISITING FRIENDS AND RELATIVES TRAVEL IN THE PACIFIC: A SAMOAN CASE STUDY</field><field name="creator">Rosemary Taufatofua</field><field name="description">This research examines socio-cultural change and resilience resulting from holiday tourism and visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travel. The unique cultural attributes of the Pacific region differentiates it from many other generic sea, sand and sun travel destinations worldwide, providing the region with a competitive edge. This research recognises these essential socio-cultural attributes using Samoa as a case study offering various levels of tourist and VFR interactions. The thesis investigated four communities, their culture and the impacts from holiday tourists and VFR travellers. The research methodologies guiding this research offer an innovative and credible mechanism to assess the resilience of the socio-cultural fabric of a Pacific Island nation with growing holiday tourism and a thriving VFR travel sector. A social and cultural capital approach was used to understand communities and their networks in a dynamic and comprehensive way. A combination of participatory action research techniques and critical ethnographic methodologies were used to interact with respondents. Analysis of data used both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods. Results of this research have significantly furthered discussion of the socio-cultural fabric of those communities studied in Samoa and how individual socio-cultural elements are influenced by holiday tourism and VFR travel. Based on the analysis of these holiday tourist and VFR traveller impacts, the results can guide planning and policy oriented benchmarks for improved socio-culturally sustainable tourism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">socio-cultural resilience</field><field name="subject">social and cultural capital</field><field name="subject">visiting friends and relative travelers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185435</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A participatory design approach in the engineering of ubiquitous computing systems</field><field name="creator">Timothy Cederman-Haysom</field><field name="description">Ubiquitous computing aims to make human-computer interaction as naturalistic and functionally invisible as possible through embedding computing potential within a particular context to support human activity. However, much of ubiquitous computing research is focussed on technical innovation due to the challenges involved with deploying embedded computing, thereby reducing the commitment to the philosophical ideals of ubiquitous computing in research. This dissertation describes the investigation of a participatory approach to technically-complex research in order to understand how our view of the engineering and human challenges changes when the two are approached hand-in-hand. The domain chosen for this system was a dental surgery. Dentistry involves a complex workspace with computer interaction constrained by surgery hygiene. Ubiquitous computing offers a compelling interaction alternative to the keyboard and mouse paradigm in such an environment. A multi-method approach that employed ethnographic research and design prototyping was undertaken with dentists from several different private practices. A series of field studies used ethnographic methods such as observation and interview. Design events explored prototypes with activities such as design games, contextual interviews, role-playing and contextual prototyping. Activities were devised with the aim of providing a level playing field, whereby both designers and participants feel they can contribute equally, with their respective disciplinary knowledge. It was found that methods needed to be carefully chosen, devised and managed, in order to communicate complex concepts with participants and to constrain the design to technically feasible options. The thesis examines the design problem from the perspectives of a variety of different stakeholders within a participatory design framework, reflected upon by means of human-centred action research. Data was gathered through design speculations and observation, and explored using methods such as the Video Card Game and Video Interaction Analysis. Fieldwork was analysed using a multi-stage qualitative analysis process which informed further design collaboration with participants. The analysis of data gathered during design studies with dentists also contributed to the development of a prototype system to validate methodological contributions. The resulting prototype utilised off-the-shelf hardware and software which allowed for innovative customisation and development. In-situ prototyping (defined by the author as &#8220;participatory bootstrapping&#8221;) and a comprehensive knowledge of the domain afforded the creative application of technology. In addition to contributing to the prototype design, the interpretive understandings drawn from analysis identified how technical ideas were presented and utilised by participants of the studies, and how best to engage busy professionals. The final outcomes of the research were a multimodal ubiquitous computing system for interacting within a dental surgery; the development and implementation of a variety of methods aimed at communicating technical concepts and eliciting user motivations, practices and concerns; and a set of design principles for engineers engaging in design of systems for human use. The research presented within this thesis is primarily part of the field of human-computer interaction, but provides evidence of how engineering development can be influenced by a user-centred participatory approach. The benefits that derive from inclusive methods of design are demonstrated by the evaluation of a prototype that employed such methods. The contribution of this thesis is to demonstrate and delineate methods for developing ubiquitous computing technologies for the context of human use. This led to a set of design principles for the engineering of systems for human use: 1. Technology needs to be robust and simple to appropriate. This allows users to give insights on technology developments and also to allow users to discover for themselves how they would use the technology. 2. An evolving and carefully considered set of methods are needed to elicit communication between practitioners and across disciplines. The gaps in understandings and the different representations that arise across the disciplines provide essential clues to next steps in design. These gaps and differences form tensions that can be exploited productively. 3. Context is important for determining which design steps to take. Rather than abstracting a problem in order to solve it, as is usual in engineering design, the problem should remain grounded in the context of use. It reveals what the real problems are that need to be solved rather than the imagined ones. This requires an appreciation of the situated nature of action and of the variability of work. In turn it also requires an appreciation of what the human can and does do and what the machine should support. 4. Accountability in design is required. There is a fundamental tension between trying to make something work and seeing what really does work; specifically it is necessary to understand when automation is worth it in human machine systems. While engaged in the design process, engineers should ask how much technology should reconfigure human practices because of a useful outcome, rather than attempting to automate and converge devices for its own sake. A clear understanding of the constraints and workings of the work space needs to be balanced with the understandings of the limitations of the technology in order to design a system that improves work practice and empowers the practitioner.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">Participatory design</field><field name="subject">user-centred design</field><field name="subject">dentists</field><field name="subject">engineering design</field><field name="subject">ubiquitous computing</field><field name="subject">interaction design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185451</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the acoustic behaviour, ecology, biogeography, genetic relatedness and species limits within the Pauropsalta annulata Goding and Froggatt species complex (Hemiptera: Cicadidae)</field><field name="creator">Lindsay Popple</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates aspects of the ecology, morphology, bioacoustics, genetic relatedness, biogeography and taxonomy of cicadas in the Pauropsalta annulata Goding and Froggatt species complex, across their entire eastern Australian geographical distribution. These cicadas seem to emerge at the same sites annually, although the exact duration of their life cycle is not known. They are wary and mobile insects, with individuals generally taking flight at the first sign of disturbance, which makes them challenging to record, capture and observe. The males produce distinctive calling songs that have a consistent rhythmic structure, which is critically important for attracting females. In most cases, the songs are biphasic, with a penetrating introductory or "buzzing" component that apparently functions in mate attraction and a strongly structured cueing or "lilting" component for mate localisation. Initially Pauropsalta annulata was thought to comprise a single species with some degree of geographically structured variation in its calling song. Consequently, various "song types" had been recognised, but their precise relationship to one another had never been investigated. Therefore the structure of their calling songs were compared statistically across individuals of three song types, and this revealed four discrete clusters that were demonstrated to be independent of one another and consistent in their calling song structure. Plotting the geographical distributions of these cicadas revealed that each of the P. annulata song types is independently distributed geographically, with areas of overlap that are relatively small. Calling song structure is consistent for each song type across extensive geographical space and this structure holds even into areas of sympatry. One song type showed consistent differences from the others in male genitalia structure, and female ovipositor length differs significantly among three of the other song types. Each song type was found to be strongly associated with a small number of tree species and these associations are maintained into areas of sympatry. The spatial ecological and morphological comparisons in song structure, plant associations and morphology made in this study demonstrate that the P. annulata song types actually represent a complex of cryptic species. Two of the song types appear to intergrade in areas of sympatric overlap in terms of calling songs, plant associations and morphology, and thus represent subspecies as defined in population genetics terms. The components of the male calling song were then investigated to determine their specific functions and thus how they could delimit species boundaries. Significant differences were found in dominant song frequency between three of the four species, and may contribute to differential mate attraction. Both components of the song of each species have the same dominant frequency. Consistent differences were also evident, among species and subspecies, in the rhythmic structure of the "lilting" component of the male calling song. This component contains repeated phrases and each one of these provides a cue to which the conspecific female may respond. Her response is timed for the brief silent interval between the phrases. At this point the calling song becomes a duet, which enables the male to locate the female, as he actively searches for her on the surrounding branches at this stage. The calling song is discussed in terms of random mating within gene pools of these cicadas and in terms of its role as part of their broader fertilisation mechanism. A molecular analysis of the P. annulata species complex was performed to examine the phylogenetic relationships across 12 species and four subspecies defined in this study, and estimate divergence times within the group. Individual specimens were sampled widely across the geographical distributions of the species and subspecies where possible to account for genetic variation across space. DNA sequences from two loci were amplified: mitochondrial CO1 ("barcoding region") and a large intron from the dynamin nuclear gene. Separate phylogenies were reconstructed for each locus using maximum parsimony procedures and Bayesian posterior sampling with implementation of a relaxed molecular clock. The phylogenies from both genes provided strong support for the monophyly of the P. annulata species complex, and nine of the species were monophyletic based on the CO1 gene. The remaining three emerged non-monophyletic. Based on a clock calibration of 0.0165s/s/myr, the monophyletic clades represented by extant P. annulata species diverged about 4.5-8.0 million years ago. Those species that emerged non-monophyletic had shallower divergences, with the exception of one species, which exhibited haplotype diversity that conferred up to 13.2% sequence divergence between allopatric populations in CO1. Dynamin produced a broadly similar phylogenetic pattern to that of CO1, but the relationships among individuals across the species and subspecies that emerged non-monophyletic differed substantially. This lack of congruence between the two genomes, in combination with the dominance of internal haplotypes in both loci, indicates an overall pattern of deep coalescence rather than interspecific hybridization. Therefore the molecular data do not provide an alternative definition of species limits in the P. annulata species complex, despite some emerging non-monophyletic in this analysis. Sound interpretation of the phylogenetic pattern discovered here would not have been possible without the acoustic, ecological and geographical investigations on species limits that preceded this work. To determine what biological and climatic factors influence the present day distributions of these cicadas, the distributions of two of the most closely related species in the P. annulata species complex were compared with the distributions of the tree species with which each is mainly associated. Because a large part of their life cycle is subterranean, soil texture, pH, electrical conductivity and force required for surface penetration were compared across sites where each of the cicadas occur in sympatry and allopatry. Finally, the influence of temperature and rainfall variables were investigated by testing 'predicted distribution' models (formed using positive distribution records) against negative records for both sets of variables, individually and in combination. The results show that the extent of the distribution of the cicada species is substantially less than that of the associated tree species. The geographical distributions of one of the species may be influenced more by rainfall, or a combination of temperature and rainfall, whereas the other species appears to be more influenced by temperature alone. Both species tolerate soils with a wide range of pH levels, electrical conductivity and forces required for surface penetration. They both showed a strong association with soils that had a silt loam texture, with only few records from sandy soils. However, none of the soils sampled where the cicadas occurred were heavy clays, which suggests that the physical properties of such soils may provide an unsuitable environment for the nymphal stages of the life cycle of these particular cicadas. The resolution of species limits within the P. annulata species complex allowed the redescription of Pauropsalta annulata Goding and Froggatt sensu stricto and the description of 11 new species belonging to the P. annulata species group, all from eastern Australia. Two of these species comprise two subspecies each, also all new. New distribution records and calling song data are documented for the allied species, P. ayrensis Ewart, which is redescribed to include the characters newly recognised in the present study as significant taxonomically with respect to Pauropsalta cicadas. The treatment includes comprehensive descriptions of the morphology and calling songs of the species and subspecies, and separate descriptive keys are provided for both sets of characters. The new taxa comprise P. artatus sp. nov., P. corymbiae sp. nov., P. decorus sp. nov., P. graniticus sp. nov., P. inversus inversus subsp. nov., P. i. laboris subsp. nov., P. notialis notialis subsp. nov., P. notialis incitatus subsp. nov., P. simplex sp. nov., P. subtropicus sp. nov, P. torrensis sp. nov. and P. tremulus sp. nov. Areas of hybridization between P. n. notialis subsp. nov. and P. n. incitatus subsp. nov. are also documented, together with their calling songs and morphology, which justifies their subspecific status. The P. inversus subspecies are allopatric, but consistently differ in the duration between phrases of the calling song. Finally, the results and conclusions are amalgamated into a critical reassessment of what defines species limits and the most appropriate approaches to investigating species limits in sexual organisms. Some historical discussions are revisited, such as the question of the reality of species and how species are perceived under the premises of neoDarwinism. The realism of species demands that species limits are most realistically defined in terms of their fertilisation mechanism, for this delimits the gene pool and thus the distribution of adaptations (the calling song of cicadas, for example).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">acoustic receiver</field><field name="subject">bioacoustics</field><field name="subject">courtship</field><field name="subject">evolutionary theory</field><field name="subject">isolation concept</field><field name="subject">mating behaviour</field><field name="subject">recognition concept</field><field name="subject">reproductive isolation</field><field name="subject">signaller</field><field name="subject">speciation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185509</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Association of Adiponectin Profiles with Dietary Carbohydrate Intake, Feeding, Gender, Body Weight, Fat Mass, and Insulin Sensitivity in Healthy Young Cats (Felis catus)</field><field name="creator">Heok Yit Tan</field><field name="description">Adiponectin is an adipose-derived protein (adipocytokine) that is secreted by adipose tissue. It has insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective properties, and is thought to be protective against obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Humans and cats are two species that commonly develop type 2 diabetes associated with insulin resistance, impaired beta cell function and spontaneous islet amyloid deposition. The domestic cat (Felis catus) has recently been proposed as an animal model for human type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the physiology of adiponectin in cats. Therefore, we set out to investigate the association of adiponectin profiles with dietary carbohydrate intake, feeding, body weight, fat mass, and insulin sensitivity in healthy young adult cats (n=32; 2-4 years old; gender ratio 1:1; body condition 4-5/9). Cats were fed a moderate carbohydrate diet (37% ME) at maintenance energy requirements for four weeks. Cats were then assigned to either receive a low (19% ME) or high (52% ME) carbohydrate diet and fed at maintenance energy requirements for another four weeks, followed by ad-libitum feeding for eight weeks to facilitate weight gain. Adiponectin profiles including total circulating adiponectin and its distribution [low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin], and proportion of adiponectin that is HMW (SA) were measured by ELISA and velocity sedimentation using sucrose gradients, followed by Western blotting, respectively. We demonstrated inter-animal variation in total adiponectin concentration at baseline (0.6 to 15.0 &#61549;g/mL), with the adiponectin present in both LMW and HMW forms. Feeding with a high carbohydrate diet for four weeks at maintenance energy requirements resulted in increased total adiponectin concentration, which was associated with an increased concentration of LMW adiponectin. In contrast, feeding with a low carbohydrate diet for four weeks at maintenance energy requirements resulted in increased concentration of HMW adiponectin, decreased LMW adiponectin concentration, and increased SA, without a change in total adiponectin concentration. In cats fed the high carbohydrate diet, total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin concentrations become lower at six hours after feeding, as compared to the fasting concentrations. This phenomenon was not observed in cats fed a low carbohydrate diet, indicating a diet-dependent postprandial effect. There was no effect of gender on any of the adiponectin profiles in cats. Unlike other studies in humans and mice in which adiponectin concentrations decreased as fat mass increased, our data indicate that a moderate weight gain achieved by ad libitum feeding of a low carbohydrate diet for eight weeks correlated with increased adiponectin concentrations. Total adiponectin concentration (mirrored by HMW adiponectin) was positively correlated with body weight gain and fat mass gain (but not absolute fat mass) in our overweight cats. Furthermore, the fat mass-related increases in plasma adiponectin over eight weeks correlated with insulin sensitivity (higher adiponectin concentration corresponded to greater insulin sensitivity in overweight cats). These data hint at the possibility that in overweight animals, adiponectin is similar to other adipokines that rise concomitantly with increased of moderate fat mass gain and thus increases insulin sensitivity. Overall, the knowledge in this study therefore provides useful information to veterinarians and cat food manufacturers, and forms a foundation for future studies to extend our knowledge of adiponectin in cats. Data gathered in cats may also be applicable to humans and could therefore inform research using cats as an animal model of human obesity and type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">adiponectin</field><field name="subject">high molecular weight (HMW)</field><field name="subject">cats</field><field name="subject">dietary carbohydrate intake</field><field name="subject">postprandial</field><field name="subject">body weight</field><field name="subject">fat</field><field name="subject">insulin sensitivity</field><field name="subject">type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">animal models</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185610</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Mobility in a Hybrid Chinese Economy: Social Capital and Emerging Entrepreneurs</field><field name="creator">Pamela Jackson</field><field name="description">As China develops and progresses as a nation, unique patterns of social mobility are emerging. For many years a centrally planned economy, the country is now a hybrid economy characterised by its authoritative political structure while allowing its entrepreneurs to experiment with innovative ways to accumulate wealth and &#8216;get ahead&#8217;. The research is particularly interested and aims in understanding how a specific group of people, namely the home-grown entrepreneurs, have been able to achieve social mobility within the contemporary Chinese economy. It focuses on the city of Suzhou in Jiangsu Province. Suzhou was chosen as the research setting because, since the beginning of the 1980s, it has been rapidly transformed into a business and industrial centre by implementation of economic reforms shaped by Deng Xiaoping and the production of infrastructure, such as the Economic and Technological Development Zones, from Communist Party initiatives. Home-grown entrepreneurs were ready to take advantage of the booming business opportunities by using their personal resources and networks afforded by the economic reforms that introduced foreign direct investment to coincide with private business reform. Specifically, it examines how the economic reforms have fostered conditions that allowed home-grown entrepreneurs to emerge and prosper and, in turn, how these entrepreneurs cultivate and utilise their social capital to form strategies to create pathways leading to social mobility. Qualitative research uncovers the social mobility of these entrepreneurs by interviewing in-depth a total of 50 home-grown entrepreneurs from different generations currently operating in Suzhou. The research reveals that while the economic reforms did provide a favourable environment for conducting private businesses, it has been equally important for each generation of home-grown entrepreneurs to take specific risks and seize opportunities to acquire various forms of social capital and to adjust personal values and imposed goals to reflect the complex social and political dynamics of their times. They had to make appropriate decisions to consolidate their businesses through careful consideration and manipulation of a variety of social capital. While social mobility may seem more accessible under the new hybrid economy, business failures and growing social inequalities have not been uncommon. Data analysis provides insights to conclude that the research may construct a new normative theory about a value driven society with economic aspirations within social controls constructed by authoritarian capitalism. As home-grown entrepreneurs begin to dominate, they are not only redefining how various forms of social capital should be linked to trajectories for social mobility, increasingly they are also transforming the social landscapes of China&#8217;s business world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China, Entrepreneurship, Social Capital, Social Mobility</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185655</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and Function of Binuclear Metallohydrolases: Enterobacter aerogenes glycerophosphodiesterase and related enzymes</field><field name="creator">Kieran Hadler</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on structural and functional studies of a novel glycerophosphodiesterase (GpdQ) from Enterobacter aerogenes. GpdQ is highly promiscuous and is the first known phosphatase which is capable of degrading all three classes of phosphate esters (mono-, di- and triesters). Remarkably, GpdQ is also able to hydrolyse stable aliphatic phosphate esters and has been shown to degrade the hydrolysis product of the nerve agent VX. For these reasons, GpdQ has been realised to have potential as a powerful bioremediator for the removal of organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. GpdQ is a binuclear metallohydrolase in which one of the metal ions is very weakly bound. Chapter 1 introduces the catalytic mechanisms of binuclear metallohydrolases by examining two related phosphate ester-degrading enzymes. Since one of the main features of catalysis addressed in this thesis are the differential metal binding affinities of GpdQ, Chapter 1 also canvasses a range of other binuclear metallohydrolases with similar behaviour. Chapter 2 examines the structural and evolutionary relationship between GpdQ and a number of other related enzymes. Using genome database searches, the two most closely related enzymes are identified. In performing these searches, a novel, putative binuclear metallohydrolase from Homo sapiens is also discovered. This enzyme, Hsa_aTRACP, is most closely related to PAPs, however construction of a homology model indicates that the active site tyrosine residue of PAP is replaced by histidine. In this respect, it may represent an evolutionary link to Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and GpdQ. The biology and chemistry of this putative enzyme is discussed. PAPs are the only binuclear enzymes with an established heterovalent active site of the type Fe(III)-M(II) (where M=Fe, Zn or Mn) whereas the majority of enzymes in this family have homovalent metal centres, including GpdQ and Ser/Thr protein. This is brought about due to the nature of the coordination sphere imposed by the enzyme. The activity of GpdQ can be reconstituted in the presence of Co(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Cd(II). Chapter 3 examines the kinetic properties of a binuclear homovalent system by studying the kinetic properties of Cd(II)-substituted GpdQ and a corresponding model complex. This comparative study leads to the identification of a terminal hydroxide molecule as the likely reaction-initiating nucleophile in Cd(II)-GpdQ with a pKa of 9.4. In Chapter 4, a detailed study of the structural, kinetic and spectroscopic behaviour of Co(II)-substituted GpdQ is presented. This chapter specifically probes the formation of the binuclear active site, the role of the metal ions in catalysis, the identity of the nucleophile and the potential role of any first or second coordination sphere residues in the regulation of enzyme activity, proton donation and metal ion coordination. Based on these findings, a detailed reaction mechanism is proposed in which the substrate itself promotes the formation of the catalytically competent binuclear centre and phosphorolysis occurs following nucleophilic attack by a terminal hydroxide molecule. A potential role of Asn80 (a ligand of one of the metal ions) in regulating both substrate and metal binding, and the role of the bridging hydroxide molecule in the activation of the terminal nucleophile is proposed. Chapter 5 employs a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic techniques to probe the proposed catalytic mechanism of GpdQ in depth. The formation of the catalytically competent binuclear centre is observed in pre-steady state studies, an integral first step in the catalytic mechanism. The dissociation and rate constants associated with formation of the binuclear centre are quantified. The rate of substrate turnover in GpdQ is relatively modest but is enhanced by a structural rearrangement involving the flexible Asn80 ligand. This structural change fine-tunes the reaction mechanism, leading to optimal reactivity. The steady-state kinetic properties of a series of metal ion derivatives (Co(II), Cd(II) and Mn(II)) of GpdQ and their reactivity towards a number of substrates are also compared. These findings lead to the conclusion that the reaction mechanism of GpdQ is modulated by both substrate and metal ion. In this respect, GpdQ is adaptive to the environmental conditions to which it is exposed by employing a flexible mechanistic strategy to achieve catalysis. Chapter 6 correlates the electronic and geometric structure of the binuclear centre in GpdQ as a means to probe specific aspects of the mechanism. This study uses the wild type enzyme and a site-directed mutant (Asn80Asp) to examine the structure of the metal ions at two stages of catalysis. The role of the bridging hydroxide molecule in nucleophilic activation is specifically addressed by monitoring changes in the electronic exchange interaction and other structural parameters as a result of phosphate binding. Also, the coordination environment of the metal ions in both the free enzyme and the phosphate-bound enzyme of wild type and Asn80Asp GpdQ were assessed against the currently proposed structures. The findings in this chapter corroborate the proposed catalytic mechanism of GpdQ. In summary, this project led to a detailed understanding of the mechanism of GpdQ, and provided insight into how both the metal ion composition and the identity of the substrate may modulate this mechanism. The knowledge gained may lead to the design of catalytically more efficient derivatives (mutants) of GpdQ for application in bioremediation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycerophosphodiesterase</field><field name="subject">phosphoesterase</field><field name="subject">binuclear metallohydrolase</field><field name="subject">magnetic circular dichroism</field><field name="subject">stopped-flow fluorescence</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">electron paramagnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186121</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETIC ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT TRAITS FOR CONFECTIONERY SUNFLOWER IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Yue Sun</field><field name="description">Sunflower is grown worldwide for oil production. In Australia, sunflower is under intense competition from canola as an oil crop. Confectionery sunflower aimed for the overseas snack food market is a potential opportunity for Australian farmers due to its ability to provide off-season supply to the major market located mainly in the northern hemisphere. To serve this aim, new confectionery sunflower hybrids adapted to Australian production system with drought tolerance, large achenes, high self-fertility and rust resistance are of paramount importance. The objectives of this project were to understand the genetic inheritance and genetic linkage relationships of the above traits and also to identify linked DNA markers with the potential for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The inheritance of achene-length was studied in a 12 x 12 diallel and a 14 x 12 North Carolina design II (NC II) mating design. Achene-length was evaluated under three environments for each mating design. Genetic correlation among all five achene-size related traits (achene-length, -width, - thickness and also kernel-length and -width) and 100-achene weight were moderate to high. Narrow-and broad-sense heritability for achene-length was moderate to high and similar for each design. The general combining ability (GCA) and maternal effects were found to be the main genetic factors controlling achene-length and each accounted for around 45% of the total genotypic variance. The inheritance of self-fertility (SF) was assessed with the same 12 x 12 diallel mating design evaluated in two environments. The 12 parents also displayed various levels of SF in addition to a wide range of achene-length. Negative genetic correlations between SF and all five achene-size related traits and 100-achene weight were observed. Modelling achene-length as a covariate revealed that certain pre-pollination floret characteristics represented by achene-length at maturity strongly affects SF in sunflower. When the effect of achene-length was removed statistically as a covariate, the specific combining ability (SCA) effect increased dramatically and became the major factor (other than pre-pollination floret characteristics) for SF determination and accounted for 65% of the total variance. Long achene genotypes tended to have low SF and a positive SCA effect was observed more frequently in F1 hybrids that involved small achene lines. The broad sense heritability was moderate (0.663 &#177; 0.017), while the estimate of narrow-sense heritability was nearly zero. A segregating F6:7 recombinant inbred line population with 239 progeny was developed from a cross between HaR4, a low delta (&#916;), high transpiration efficiency (TE), sunflower line with rust resistance but relatively low SF, and SA52 with all the characteristics in the opposite direction. The population was evaluated in two environments for three TE-related traits including &#916;, specific leaf weight (SLW) and chlorophyll content (CC) and four agronomic traits i.e. days to flowering (DTF), plant height (PlantH), SF and rust resistance (RustR). A linkage map 1074.6 cM in length with 138 SSR and 37 ISSR markers consisting of 19 linkage groups was constructed. Spatially adjusted BLUPs were used in QTL analysis for individual and combined environments. Altogether, 10 QTL were identified for &#916;, SLW and CC at individual environments, and 7 were detected by a combined analysis. Sixteen QTL were identified for 4 agronomic traits and 14 of them were confirmed by a combined analysis. Significant linkage among all three TE related traits was discovered on linkage group 4 (LG4), where alleles from one parent had the same direction of influence on TE which suggested either coupling phase linkage or pleiotropy. QTL for SF and RustR were closely linked on LG13. An F2 population with 502 progeny developed from a cross between Jumbo, a large achene confectionery sunflower line, and RIL25, an oilseed small achene line, was evaluated for five achene-size related traits in a single field trial. Using a subset of 178 progeny a framework genetic linkage map, 899.7 cM in length, containing 128 SSR markers and 23 ISSR markers was constructed with 18 linkage groups. Based on the results of a simulated QTL analysis, a modified selective genotyping strategy was employed for QTL analysis with 178 F2 individuals (128 randomly selected, 25 shortest achene F2&#8217;s and 25 longest achene F2&#8217;s). Altogether 18 achene-size related QTL with small effects were identified. Achene-size related genes characteristically expressed additive gene action although several alleles were partially recessive towards the large achene parent. The 18 identified achene-size related QTL were validated in the same diallel mating experiment mentioned above. Significant marker-trait associations were detected for 15 QTL. In addition to 12 significant alleles detected from the F2 population, 12 additional alleles associated with achene-size traits were revealed after the analysis with the diallel. These markers are ready to be used in MAS for confectionery sunflower breeding. Great steps have been made in obtaining essential knowledge of inheritance and linkage of target traits for breeding confectionery sunflower adapted to Australian production environments. The identified markers can be used in MAS and further enhance the breeding process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confectionery sunflower</field><field name="subject">quantitative trait loci</field><field name="subject">combining ability</field><field name="subject">carbon isotope discrimination</field><field name="subject">specific leaf weight</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll content</field><field name="subject">achene size</field><field name="subject">kernel size</field><field name="subject">self-fertility</field><field name="subject">rust resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Social Networks in High Performance Football Coaching</field><field name="creator">Joseph Occhino</field><field name="description">Abstract Increasing global interest in coaching science research has resulted in a greater recognition of the complexities and dynamics existing in the coaching process (Cushion, Armour, &amp; Jones, 2003). Associated with the dynamic and complex nature of the coaching process are the many social relationships that operate within this process. A high performance coach&#8217;s network is often associated with athletes, officials, support staff and administrators. In essence, coaches form dynamic social networks (DSN; (Mallett, Rossi, &amp; Tinning, 2007) that are paramount to developing their coaching practice, and therefore their coaching knowledge. The aim of this project was to understand how high performance football coaches (HPFC) learn. The research questions were as follows: &#8226; What are the major sources of information for HPFC? &#8226; What sources of information are most valuable to the HPFC? &#8226; What role does the interaction with other coaches&#8217; play in developing knowledge? In order to better understand the nature of coach interactions in developing knowledge it is useful to consider the notions of communities of practice (CoP) (Wenger, 1998), networks of practice (NoP) (Nichani &amp; Hung, 2002), informal knowledge networks (IKN) (Allee, 2000) and dynamic social networks (DSN) (Mallett, et al., 2007). This qualitative research was conducted with six high performance football coaches (HPFC) in Australia using semi-structured interviews. Each interview was transcribed and analysed into meaning units through the process of triangular consensus. The coaches in this sample did not display a fully functioning CoP, IKN, or NoP. The HPFCs failed to display the critical element of a joint enterprise. Mutual engagement was partially reported between coaches of the same team but was not reported between opposition coaches. The coaches reported the final element of a shared repertoire. Nichani &amp; Hung&#8217;s (2002) notion of a NoP and Allee&#8217;s (2000) research on IKN were considered as possible social networks to describe the coaching context. These coaches did not develop relationships that could be characterised as a NoP. The data suggests that the development of knowledge through face-to-face interactions with other people was valued over use of Internet exchanges and chat rooms. There was evidence to suggest the formation of a coaches&#8217; IKN, however it is proposed that this was not the major source for these coaches in developing knowledge. Most importantly it was found that HPFC in the Australian context are engaged in a DSN. It was reported by the coaches in this study that their interactions are dynamic, in that they change throughout their careers to the extent that their people of influence can be numerous; this is due to two key findings. The nature of the work of HPFC is highly contested and thus the information and knowledge is sacred. This is a barrier for information and knowledge transfer and can inhibit learning. In addition finding a person of influence is a lengthy process as it can take years to build mutual trust and respect. By understanding how coaches learn their craft through their interactions with others, coach development could potentially assist coaches through the learning process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coaching knowledge, communities of practice, knowledge networks, football coaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186449</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Filling the Eighteenth-Century Void for Violists: A Study of Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Viola&#8221; Concerto, K. 622.</field><field name="creator">Frank Fodor</field><field name="description">Until such players as Lionel Tertis improved the status of their instrument in the twentieth century, violists have had to rely to a considerable extent on arrangements to help redress the void which exists in viola literature (when compared with the extensive repertory of many other instruments), a gap that is particularly apparent in the eighteenth century. One such example is the arrangement of Mozart&#8217;s Clarinet Concerto, K. 622 for solo viola. During the twentieth century, a small number of arrangements were made of this composition for viola; however, among the most interesting is an anonymous arrangement made only eleven years after the composer&#8217;s death, in 1802, by the German publishing firm Johann Anton Andr&#233;. This paper identifies the extant sources for the original clarinet version of the work, followed by an examination of the 1802 Andr&#233; arrangement.

In the course of the research I made a methodological shift to an institutional ethnographic approach in order to better understand the women&#8217;s lives as Catholics. One of the major tenets of an institutional ethnographic approach is that in modern bureaucratic organisations the authority and instructions of institutions and organisations are carried via the texts they produce. These texts can be written texts or they can be videos, film, etc. Because they carry the authority of the institution or organisation texts have the power to shape people&#8217;s lives and co-ordinate their everyday activities with multiple others, without, however, wholly determining them. In common with other major organisations the Roman Catholic Church is a large, worldwide organisation which relies on the texts it produces to carry its instructions and authority into the homes, churches and personal lives of its members. The greatest production of written texts by the Catholic Church in the modern era took place at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). While many feminist scholars have dismissed the Council proceedings as saying very little about women in particular, I argue that the Councillors&#8217; writings in several major texts have strongly and specifically impacted the lives of contemporary Catholic women. Consequently, while all the texts produced by the bishops at the council can be considered of interest to practising Catholics generally, in this study I have chosen to focus on texts that related to issues that have proved to be of particular interest to the participants of this research study: the role of the laity in the church, Mariology and marriage. In order to carry out the research involved in this study I interviewed thirty women in Australia and thirty women in Ireland between the ages of 55 and 19 years of age. The Australian women immigrated to Australia during the years 1970 and 1997. All of the participants had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church as babies and they all underwent a similar socialisation process growing up in Ireland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Australian, Catholic, Irish, identity, power, Vatican II, ruling relations, laity, Marianism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187061</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Pluralistic Analysis of Housing Renovation Choices in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Ti Ching Peng</field><field name="description">Housing renovation is a major activity for many consumers in Australia, and its growing popularity in recent years has been reflected not only by it share in GDP but also by publicity it receives via home exhibitions and numerous TV renovation shows. Despite this, and despite similar experiences in other countries, research on how decisions in this sector are made is still quite sparse, a major restraint being the limitation of secondary data. This thesis attempts to improve knowledge in this area while at the same time exploring the feasibility and benefits of doing applied economic research in a pluralistic manner. From the perspective of mainstream economics, individuals&#8217; decision-making in the context of renovation can be modelled in terms of utility/profit maximization subject to a budget constraint. The literature that has attempted to follow this research strategy is reviewed in Chapter 2, as is research undertaken in sociology that has been partly informed by behavioural economics. The economic literature fails to recognize the possible importance of social influence and psychological factors in this context. This could be unfortunate, as these factors, which are seen as important in some other economic paradigms, may explain how some renovators get derailed from rational decision-making. The methodology of pluralism offers a way to bridge between these divergent arguments by keeping mainstream insights in mind whilst at the same time adopting an &#8216;open-minded&#8217; rather than &#8216;autistic&#8217; attitudes towards different paradigms and embracing &#8216;realistic&#8217; aspects (e.g. limits to individuals&#8217; rational behaviours) rather than assuming them away. Chapter 3 examines the case for pluralism and shows that although debate in economics is often couched in terms of a battle between fundamentally opposed &#8216;mainstream&#8217; and &#8216;heterodox&#8217; views, a deeper analysis of sub-paradigms reveals a complex web of partially overlapping core ideas. Once this richer view of schools of thought in economics is recognized, orthodox economics and heterodox economics are not necessarily incompatible but rather seem potentially complementary. Despite renovation being a popular topic in Australia, relevant micro-data regarding individuals&#8217; choices and their social and psychological attitudes towards renovation are in short supply. Therefore, unlike most previous renovation studies using published secondary data, this study involved the collection of primary data by a survey mailed to a sample of Brisbane residents in late 2006 and early 2007. Chapter 4 explains this choice of method, which provided data on respondents&#8217; decision-making regarding renovation, their demographics, and social and psychological factors. This data set was used to analyse the following four topics: individuals&#8217; decision to renovate or not (Chapter 5); renovators&#8217; choice between using their own labour (DIY) or outsourcing the work (Chapter 6); psychographic segments of &#8216;non-renovators&#8217;, &#8216;DIY-renovators&#8217; and &#8216;Hire-renovators&#8217; (renovators who outsource the work) (Chapter 7); and factors shaping renovators&#8217; tendencies to engage in overcapitalization and cost escalation in their renovation projects (Chapter 8). The pluralistic philosophy is applied in an addition way to analyse these issues, since the study used a variety of statistical techniques. The empirical results reveal that this dual form of pluralism&#8212;involving theoretical inputs from a variety of paradigms (including both &#8216;old&#8217; and &#8216;new&#8217; behavioural economics, socio-economics and others) and a variety of analytical techniques (cluster analysis, logistic regression and others)&#8212;does indeed widen our understanding of this topic. Generally speaking, the empirical finding stresses the importance of psychological factors in the context of individuals&#8217; decision-making on renovation. In analysing individuals&#8217; decisions to renovate or not, it is shown that, besides conventional factors (such as age of respondents), the psychological factor &#8216;perceived self-performance in renovation&#8217; is crucial: individuals are more likely to embrace renovation if they perceive highly their ability to handle the renovation process. In exploring renovators&#8217; decisions to engage in do-it-yourself (DIY) or hire others to do the work in their latest renovation projects, besides factors such as the scope of the project and renovators&#8217; capabilities, the psychological factor &#8216;trust in contractors&#8217; plays an important role: renovators are more likely to choose to use their own labour if they are uncertain about contractors&#8217; reliability while those who outsource renovation works are in general more trusting than those who engage in DIY. The exploratory psychographic analysis of heterogeneous groups within each of the three groups (non-renovators, DIY-renovators and Hire-renovators) indicates the necessity of recognizing the heterogeneity the population when designing policies to improve the efficiency of the renovation market. In the investigation of renovators&#8217; mistakes that lead to overcapitalization and cost escalation, psychological factors did not show their expected strong influences on either of these phenomena. However, it was found that the factors related to the project itself, especially the scope of the project (approximated by &#8216;time spent on preparation&#8217;) and the age of house, influence renovators&#8217; overcapitalized spending and the extent of their cost escalation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Renovation</field><field name="subject">Decision-makings</field><field name="subject">Pluralism</field><field name="subject">Behavioural economics</field><field name="subject">Economic psychology</field><field name="subject">Do-it-yourself</field><field name="subject">Overcapitalization</field><field name="subject">Cost escalation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187033</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Cycle Assessment of Wastewater Treatment Systems</field><field name="creator">Jeffrey Foley</field><field name="description">Over recent decades, environmental regulations on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) have trended towards increasingly stringent nutrient removal requirements for the protection of local waterways. However, such regulations ignore the other environmental impacts that might accompany the apparent improvements to the WWTP. This PhD thesis used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify these environmental trade-offs, and so better inform policy makers on the wider benefits and burdens associated with wastewater treatment. A particular focus was also given to the generation of methane and nitrous oxide in wastewater systems, since the quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from WWTPs is presently a substantial area of uncertainty. Rapid changes to the GHG regulatory landscape mean that this level of uncertainty, now represents an unacceptable business risk for many water utilities. Specifically, there were three research objectives of this thesis: Research Objective No.1 &#8211; Environmental optimisation of wastewater treatment systems &#8211; For typical receiving environments, the optimum wastewater treatment system configuration is not necessarily at the limit of best practice for nutrient removal. The LCA approach to this research objective was divided into two stages. In stage I, a comprehensive desk-top life cycle inventory of ten different wastewater treatment scenarios was completed. The scenarios covered six process configurations and treatment standards ranging from raw sewage to advanced nutrient removal. It was shown that physical infrastructure, chemical usage and operational energy all increased with the level of nutrient removal. These trends represented a trade-off of negative environmental impacts against improved local receiving water quality. In stage II of the LCA, a quantitative life cycle impact assessment of the ten scenarios, referenced against Australian normalisation data, was completed. From a normalised perspective against Australian society, the contribution of WWTPs to headline issues such as global warming and energy consumption was found to be very small. The more prominent environmental impact categories were eutrophication due to nutrient discharge and toxicity issues, due to heavy metals in biosolids. There existed a broader environmental trade-off for nutrient removal, that could only be justified by society and regulators implicitly placing higher value on local water quality, than on other global environmental pressures. In light of this quantitative LCA, regulatory agencies should consider the broader environmental consequences of their policies such as the Queensland Water Quality Guidelines. It is suggested that the scope of WWTP licensing considerations should be widened from a singular focus on water quality objectives, to a more comprehensive LCA-based approach. Research Objective No. 2 &#8211; Quantification of nitrous oxide emissions from biological nutrient removal (BNR) wastewater treatment plants &#8211; Current GHG assessment methods for wastewater treatment plants are grossly inaccurate because of significant unaccounted N2O emissions. The research for objectives two and three was funded by the Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA), which is the peak body of the Australian urban water industry. Thus, whilst the earlier LCA results suggested that GHG emissions from WWTPs were insignificant from a national perspective, the industry is actually very engaged on this issue from an environmental responsibility and business risk perspective. This PhD study adopted a rigorous mass balance approach to determine N2O-N generation at seven full-scale WWTPs. The results varied considerably in the range 0.006 &#8211; 0.253 kgN2O-N generated per kgNdenitrified (average: 0.035 +/- 0.027). These results were generally larger than the current default value assumed in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Technical Guidelines (i.e. 0.01 kg N2O-N.kgN-1denitrified). High N2O-N generation was shown to correspond with elevated bulk NO2--N concentrations in the bioreactor. The results also suggested that WWTPs designed for low effluent TN have lower and less variable N2O generation than plants that only achieve partial denitrification. Research Objective No.3 &#8211; Quantification of methane emissions from low-strength wastewater collection systems &#8211; Current default GHG assessment methods for sewerage systems are grossly inaccurate because of significant unaccounted CH4 emissions from rising mains. Presently, international GHG guidelines state that &#8220;wastewater in closed underground sewers is not believed to be a significant source of methane&#8221; (IPCC, 2006). However, the results of this PhD research demonstrated that methane generation in rising main sewers is substantial. It was shown that dissolved methane concentrations were dependent upon pipeline geometry and sewage residence time. Consequently, it was possible to develop a simple, yet robust, theoretical model that predicted methane generation from these two independent parameters. This model provides a practical means for water authorities globally to make an estimate of the currently unaccounted methane emissions from pressurised sewerage systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Life Cycle Assessment.</field><field name="subject">Normalisation</field><field name="subject">wastewater</field><field name="subject">Biological Nutrient Removal</field><field name="subject">Anaerobic</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse Gas</field><field name="subject">Methane</field><field name="subject">Nitrous Oxide</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187150</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF A CONTEMPORARY REMOTE URBAN INDIGENOUS ETHNOMEDICAL SYSTEM AND THE SOCIO-CLINICAL REALITY SHAPED BY THE RESERVE DWELLERS AND THE HOSPITAL RESIDENTS IN THE 1980s</field><field name="creator">Robyn Mobbs</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study in medical anthropology is a critically interpretative analysis of fieldwork documentation I recorded during field research conducted in the mining city of Mount Isa in the far northwest of Queensland during the 1980s. Eighteen months of participant observation research was undertaken over four fieldtrips (1981-82, 1983, 1985 and 1988) at inter-connected locations: two urban reserves for Aborigines and the people I refer to as the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the local hospital and a group of hospital resident medical officers who I refer to as the Residents. During the field research I found that both Reserve Dwellers and the Residents experienced a difficult relationship during their interactions in medical consultations in the hospital clinics. Now in this dissertation I ask an overarching question of my time-lag field data. It is How can we understand the problematic relationship between indigenous reserve-dwelling help-seekers and biomedical practitioners at their local hospital clinics in the 1980s. To describe this problematic relationship I analyse time-lag data from my diaried participant observation at both the reserves and the hospital; semi-structured interviews with the hospital Residents; case studies and case histories of consenting help-seekers from the Reserves; and illustrative transcriptions of consultations between Residents and Reserve Dwellers that were tape recorded by the Residents during hospital clinics. The contemporary ethnomedical system of the Reserve Dwellers was inclusive of biomedicalized clinics and the Residents as clinicians at this remote hospital in the 1980s. I provide an ethnographic account of a changing contemporary indigenous ethnomedical system and describe the lifeways of the Reserve Dwellers in the 1980s; their pattern of help-seeking at their local hospital including grievous happenings; and their experiences in outpatients clinics and the emergency section of the local non-indigenous hospital. Their lifeways and help-seeking were in many ways defined by the collective sociality of Kalkadunga and other regional indigenous cultures as impoverished, very sick survivors of a genocidal contact history less than 100 years before. This local history is also reconstructed. The Residents view of local indigenous illness, help-seeking, and experiences of biomedicalised hospital clinics further describe the socio-cultural reality of the time. I found that the Residents had an insightful, even predictive assessment of local illness burden. At the same time, they held strong views about a pattern of help-seeking in the outpatients and emergency clinics that was considered disruptive of hospital routines. I also describe how they expressed their difficulties interacting with Aboriginal help-seekers including the taking of biomedical histories. My thesis is that a localized socio-clinical reality was shaped by a synchronic, coeval relationship between Reserve Dwellers enculturated within a changing, contemporary ethnomedical belief system that incorporated biomedicalized hospital clinics, and the Residents as clinicians enculturated within a culture of biomedical science at a remote hospital. I argue that the lifeways and pattern of help-seeking of the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the Residents&#8217; views about sick indigenous help-seekers, formed this particular socio-clinical reality. It was then consistently replicated by problematic socio-clinical interaction and biomedicalized praxis that inhibited investigation and curative outcomes for the Reserve Dwellers and other indigenous help-seekers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal health and hospitals, indigenous lifeways, indigenous help-seeking, socio-clinical reality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187678</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic etiology of human sexuality</field><field name="creator">Brendan Zietsch</field><field name="description">Sexuality is central to our individual lives, our society, and our evolution, but its etiology is not thoroughly understood. Using data from 4904 Australian twins who completed a questionnaire on sexual attitudes and behaviours, I investigated the genetic and environmental influences underlying variation in and covariation between psychological and behavioural aspects of sexuality. Moreover, I explored the role of sexuality traits in several different contexts: evolution, mental health, public health, personality, and problematic behaviour. Before presenting reports of the four main empirical studies in this thesis, I make the case for the importance of studying human sexuality, outline previous findings on the etiology of individual differences in sexuality, and describe the behavioural genetic principles and techniques that were used in the investigations. I also present an additional fifth paper reporting a behavioural genetic analysis of EEG power, which I undertook in order to learn twin data modelling and complex multivariate techniques. In the first empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from an evolutionary perspective. As sexual orientation is genetically influenced, it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency. I tested the hypothesis that while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals&#8217; reproductive success, they may confer some advantage for heterosexuals who carry them. Results showed that psychologically masculine females and feminine men are 1) more likely to be nonheterosexual, but 2) when they are heterosexual have more opposite-sex sexual partners. Genetic modelling revealed that both these relationships are partly due to pleiotropic genetic influences common to each trait. Further, heterosexuals with a nonheterosexual twin had more opposite-sex partners than do heterosexual twin pairs. Taken together, these results suggest that genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could contribute to the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population. In the second empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from the perspective of mental health risk. Large epidemiological studies have shown that homosexuals are at much greater risk of psychiatric disorder than the general population. This has been assumed, with some supporting evidence, to be because of the prejudice and discrimination experienced by homosexuals in a heterosexist society. Here I tested the viability of alternative explanations, using Eysenck&#8217;s Neuroticism and Psychoticism scales as markers for psychiatric vulnerability. Firstly, I tested whether apparent sexual orientation differences in psychiatric vulnerability simply mirror sex differences &#8211; for our traits, this would predict nonheterosexual males having elevated Neuroticism scores as females do, and nonheterosexual females having elevated Psychoticism scores as males do. The results contradicted this idea, with nonheterosexual men and women scoring significantly higher on both Neuroticism and Psychoticism than their heterosexual counterparts, suggesting an overall elevation of psychiatric risk in nonheterosexuals. Secondly, I used the genetically informative sample to assess the viability of explanations invoking a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability. We found significant genetic correlations between sexual orientation and both Neuroticism and Psychoticism, but no corresponding environmental correlations, suggesting that if there is a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability it is likely to have a genetic basis rather than an environmental basis. The third empirical paper investigated the etiology of risky sexual behaviour, which is relevant to public health and welfare through its role in STD transmission and unwanted pregnancies. Results showed that variation in risky sexual behaviour is due to genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental influences to approximately equal degrees. The genetic influences partly overlapped with genetic influences on dispositional factors, with significant genetic correlations between risky sexual behaviour and Eysenck&#8217;s Impulsivity, Extraversion, Psychoticism, and Neuroticism. This suggests that the genetic influences that shape our personality may also predispose us to risky sexual behaviour. The fourth empirical paper investigated the etiology of a strong association (r = .50) between risky sexual behaviour and adolescent misconduct. Results indicated that the association is due to overlapping genetic and environmental influences, but that in males genes are the primary source of the association whereas in females shared environment plays the greater role. These findings suggest that a general predisposition to risky behaviour may manifest in different potentially harmful ways in adolescence (misconduct) and adulthood (risky sexual behaviour), and that different processes are involved in male and female etiology. Following the empirical reports, I provide a general discussion of my research findings and the study of human sexuality more generally. After summarising the findings and their implications, I then provide a detailed description of potential limitations of the research and to what extent they qualify the conclusions drawn. I also critically discuss the absence of sexuality traits from the major models of personality, and why this and other shortcomings make the personality models inadequate from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, I suggest directions for future research in light of the research and discussion presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual orientation</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">risky sexual behaviour</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187748</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using wildlife tourism and post-visit support to enhance families&#8217; conservation learning at Mon Repos Conservation Park</field><field name="creator">Karen Hughes</field><field name="description">Abstract Nature-based tourism and wildlife tourism are becoming increasingly popular worldwide and are often promoted as a means of protecting and preserving environmental resources. These forms of tourism are usually accompanied by interpretation such as signs, presentations and activities specifically designed to raise visitors&#8223; awareness of, and concern for, environmental issues. The rationale behind this approach is that enhancing visitors&#8223; environmental knowledge, understanding and attitudes prompts the adoption of environmentally responsible behaviours. This is supported by a growing body of research that suggests that environmental interpretation has considerable potential to impact upon visitors&#8223; conservation knowledge and attitudes, and that well-designed interpretive experiences and messages are an effective means of reducing a range of negative &#8222;on-site&#8223; behaviours such as littering, straying from walkways and feeding wildlife. However, there has been little exploration of whether environmental interpretation influences the uptake of conservation practices &#8222;off-site&#8223; or how the positive impacts of nature-based tourism can be maintained over time. Until recently, tourism research exploring post-visit behaviour has used visitors&#8223; immediate post-visit intentions as a measure of behaviour change. There is increasing evidence, however, that stated intentions to engage in conservation behaviours rarely manifest as actual behaviour, and that visitors&#8223; on-site enthusiasm and commitment tends to wane following their visit. The current research aimed to investigate whether providing visitors with post-visit support in the form of learning materials and reminders would prevent this decline and enhance long-term conservation learning (hereby defined as knowledge, attitudes and behaviour). This research explores short and long-term changes in families&#8223; conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour following their visit to Mon Repos Conservation Park, a world renowned turtle rookery in Queensland, Australia. Stage one of the study involved surveying 100 Australian families to identify barriers and benefits associated with six conservation practices (re-using containers, buying minimal packaging, reducing use of plastic bags, picking up litter, recycling and composting). Using Community-based Social Marketing theory, responses informed the development of printed and online post-visit action resources specifically designed to reinforce the wildlife tourism experience and support families&#8223; conservation learning. Resources focused on the six conservation behaviours outlined above but also included other environmental activities and conservation information of relevance. v In stage two, two hundred Australian families visiting Mon Repos in December 2007 and January 2008 were sampled and assigned to either a treatment group (provided with post-visit action resources and regular contact) or the control group (no post-visit support). All families were asked to complete pre-visit, post-visit and follow-up questionnaires to enable the researcher to ascertain short-term and long-term changes in their conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and to identify factors contributing to the uptake of off-site conservation practices. The final sample comprised the one hundred families who completed all three questionnaires. Comparisons between responses of the control and treatment groups revealed that post-visit action resources reinforced respondents&#8223; knowledge of threats to turtles and enhanced their attitudes towards protecting wildlife and the natural environment. Families who received post-visit support were also significantly more likely to pick up litter and introduced more conservation actions than those who did not receive this support. Aspects of the post-visit action resources that were particular effective were updates of turtle activity at Mon Repos, emails, fact sheets and the newsletter. Other factors that prompted the adoption of conservation practices included Mon Repos&#8223; interpretation and the opportunity to view wildlife in its natural surroundings. The influence of other family members and pre-visit knowledge and interest were also found to be associated with subsequent uptake of conservation behaviours. Implications for wildlife interpretive practice and the design and delivery of post-visit support are discussed and recommendations for future research presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation learning</field><field name="subject">wildlife tourism</field><field name="subject">family learning</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="subject">Community-Based Social Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A perception-influence model of innovation implementation in project related based engineering</field><field name="creator">Miller, Andrew</field><field name="description">Innovation is an imperative in all industry sectors. For those such as construction, which are not considered high-tech and which operate as one-off projects, the uptake and diffusion of new innovations into ongoing practice across projects pose particular problems. The nature of these problems faced at a project level needs to be better understood. This thesis is an exploration of innovation implementation in the context of Project-Based Engineering (PBE). It is an empirical investigation of how new planning technologies are implemented in major infrastructure construction projects and the barriers that prevent such implementations from being effective. The findings of this investigation are used to develop and evaluate a new model of innovation implementation in this context. The research design is centred on the immersion of a participant-observer in seven live construction projects over a period of 3.5 years. Each project studied was implementing the same innovation: 4D CAD modelling (3D design model + the construction schedule). A wide cross-section of data was gathered in the field including direct observations, documents and other work products from participation, email and other correspondence associated with the 4D CAD implementations, and formal and informal discussions with project-participants. These data were analysed using content analysis software to find patterns. The research was iterative and involved three phases. The initial phase was a pilot study of implementation in practice using the data from one project. It produced rich descriptions of what transpired and a critical comparison with accounts from the literature. This led to a series of propositions about the influence of project-participant perceptions that were synthesised into a new theoretical model: the initial Perception-Influence model (P-I1 model). The middle research phase then developed this model iteratively using a more-focused data collection and content analysis across four construction project organisations. This was done to provide supporting evidence for the theoretical constructs in the P-I1 model as well as to refine them and add new ones. The outcomes of the middle phase were the P-I2 and P-I3 models. The final research phase analysed the data from the last two project organisations in terms of the P-I model framework with a view to evaluating the model&#8217;s theoretical significance and practical applications. The P-I model shows that negative perceptions of value, benefit and usability can cause an innovation implementation to be ineffective as a result of discontinued use or neglect. It provides a map for the progression of an implementation using the perceptions and actions of project-participants as primary constructs. The model proposes that each perception is formed by a number of contributing factors or secondary constructs synthesised from implementation research and user acceptance literature, for example, an opinion or concern about how much an innovation costs (i.e. transaction costs). It also proposes that each perception has both a positive and negative associated action. The constructs that make up the P-I model are grounded in the empirical data. This is because the actions, opinions and concerns of project-participants observed in live projects are evident in project documentation such as emails. These two sources (i.e. observations and project documentation) provide data sets that were used to triangulate inferences about the perceptions of project-participants and the outcome of each 4D CAD implementation (i.e. effective or otherwise). This aspect of the research was not only important for the recommendation of potential applications for the P-I model but also during its conception, development and evaluation. The P-I model is a new and important perspective for both implementation research and PBE practitioners. It helps satisfy the calls for studies of innovation implementation that focus on factors at an individual level and those asking for a better understanding of innovative behaviour. This work shows PBE practitioners how the perceptions of project-participants can have a major impact on the effectiveness of an innovation implementation. The findings provide an evidential basis that can improve implementation effectiveness, especially in PBE organisations. The knowledge built into the P-I model can also assist the planning and execution of innovation implementation strategies, aid in the assessment and redirection of those in progress, and help document lessons learned for implementations within project organisations that have been previously completed. This research uses the P-I model to open the way for future empirical studies of innovation implementation in PBE contexts beyond construction. These would also provide data to further refine the constructs in the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Innovation implementation</field><field name="subject">Project-based engineering</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Influence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187785</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">As Best They Can: Canadian Women Athletes Speaking Sport Into Their Lives</field><field name="creator">Yvonne Becker</field><field name="description">Increased participation rates and significant performances of girls and women in sport over the last three decades would have many believing that the barriers and discrimination experienced in the past have been overcome and that continued participation and success into the future is unproblematic. Feminist research has problematized what now seems like acceptance of women&#8217;s participation in sport in this postmodern era by considering the location of the female athlete at the intersecting of discourses of femininity, masculinist sport, heterosexuality and homophobia. Situated among these powerful regulating forces, female athletes become subjects attached to often contradictory identities. For instance, the paradox of femininity and athleticism can result in a troubling experience that requires complex negotiation and time-consuming management of gender boundaries and behaviour expectations. Although sport has been considered a liberatory space for women, that view fails to consider that sport continues to maintain the status quo through workings of power politics that sustain oppressive social structures and relations. In this study, the review of literature in Chapter Two illuminates that sport, as it currently exists, perpetuates gender inequality and builds and maintains socio-cultural boundaries of normative femininity and heterosexuality. Unpacking women&#8217;s sport experience, therefore, involves exploring the discursive force fields that structure their everyday lives. Immersed in the dynamics of power and resistance, women performing so-called &#8220;masculine&#8221; activities such as skilled sport performance create a contradictory and precarious location for themselves. This location could be perceived as transgressive and liberating or as one that must negotiate, and possibly resolve, the tension between discursive expectancies and non-normative performances. My study examined the sport experiences of eight female athletes. Each was interviewed three times using a semi-structured interview process. During the initial interview, the participants were asked to provide the history and priority of sport in their lives and speak about the repetitive act of &#8220;becoming&#8221; an athlete as they make the transitions from other subjectivities. Chapter Four summarizes this conversation with each of the participants. Through a photo-elicitation process, one of the interviews was dedicated to revealing each of the participants&#8217; movements through the social spaces of their daily lives. Another of the interviews was supported by video footage of the athlete as she trained and/or competed in her sport(s). This data collection process allowed for the participants&#8217; multiple subject positions or locations to be spoken by them throughout the conversations. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using discourse analysis. In order to critique the various discourses that dis/advantage female athletes, the theoretical framework provided by feminist poststructuralism was chosen for this project. Through this perspective, detailed in Chapter Three, an understanding of how social power is exercised over and experienced by women is helpful in knowledge production that supports women&#8217;s on-going efforts of contestation and change. For example, continued improvement and achievement in sport performance vi could be the result of new versions of femininity fostered by my critique of the privileged female identity that allows for less docile and more athletic female bodies. Discourse analysis, as described in Chapter Three, allowed for surveying the discursive terrain of the lives of the participants. This method also illuminated the ways of speaking, descriptions and specific images that the athletes used to speak about their sport experiences. The women spoke sport into their lives and created a positive space that featured personal achievement, escape or freedom from the &#8220;rest of life&#8221;; an activity that supported a healthy body and a positive body image; a place of family support; and a social, fun and accepting environment. In contrast to this, the participants&#8217; sport space was troubled by the management and negotiation that was required by them to continue participation. Even though, as described in Chapter Five, they could speak sport into their lives in a positive way, they also spoke sport out of their lives (or at least further down the priority list) because of the effort that was required to juggle it or balance it within their multiple subjectivities. The sometimes simultaneous and always sequential contradictory gendered discursive force fields of motherhood, the ideal feminine body image, intimate relationships, compulsory heterosexuality, and physical activity required constant strategies of negotiation and management that are described in Chapter Six. A brief concluding chapter summarizes how the participants in this study found themselves frustrated by their &#8220;in-between-ness&#8221;. They are not athletes in the dominant heteronormative discursive space of male sport (they are &#8220;othered&#8221;), and they do not fit in the dominant discursive space of privileged femininity. The results of this study reveal that while sport presents itself as a site of empowerment for women, it also perpetuates and maintains traditional patriarchal values. The participants, however, creatively negotiated and renovated that patriarchal space to create a location in which they could evade the strength of dominant discourses and experience the benefits of sport engagement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Female Athletes</field><field name="subject">Feminist Poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">Femininity</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Sport</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188774</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">APPLICATION AND APPRAISAL OF A MULTI-OBJECTIVE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE EVALUATION OF FARM FORESTRY VIABILITY</field><field name="creator">David Ian Jeffreys</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis presents innovative applications of Multi-Objective Decision Support Systems (MODSS) to forestry decision support. New MODSS methodologies were developed to assess and evaluate forestry practices and finance regimes. The assessment of forestry investments draw on case studies conducted in the Hodgson Creek catchment on the Darling Downs in south Queensland and on the Atherton Tablelands in north Queensland, Australia. MODSS are systems that aid decision-making, in which a set of alternative management options are evaluated against a set of decision criteria. The criteria, that represent the stakeholders&#8217; goals and objectives, are weighted to reflect stakeholder preferences regarding their relative importance. The weighted criteria scores are then aggregated to create an overall measure of option performance. In the first case study, MODSS procedures identified from the literature as being most suitable to forestry and the MODSS software package DEFINITE was used. After a critical review of the first study, a new MODSS was developed to address the particular needs of forestry evaluations and the weaknesses of current MODSS for addressing these needs. Limitations of the Hodgson Creek MODSS included lack of stakeholder engagement in the MODSS development process, inefficient use of the stakeholder time and an excessive work load on the experts in the scoring process. The new MODSS development process included the combined use of weighted sum and Electr&#233; aggregation methods, these being compensatory and non-compensatory aggregation methods. This combination of aggregation methods provided a measure of overall option performance and identified the presence of fatal flaws in the options. Various criteria weighting methods were trialled &#8211; including rank order methods, the analytical hierarchy process and direct assessments &#8211; to assess their utility for defining weights that reflected stakeholder priorities. A new hybrid weighting technique was developed using a combination of rank order methods and direct assessments. A new and innovative process for scoring options and criteria was developed, using an adaption of the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) in conjunction with a new computer-based Group Decision Support System (GDSS). This iterative process involved repeated rounds of individual scoring and group discussions. In the workshop conducted to elicit scores from experts, the GDSS was used to identify criteria where the elicited scores differed and discussions were focused on these criteria. After the discussions the options were rescored against the criteria and discussed further. This analysis was innovative in that uncertainty around the individual option scores was addressed for the first time using MODSS. This new application was developed in a spreadsheet using the risk analysis package @RISK. Evaluations of forestry options were undertaken at various time scales to address the long delay between incurring costs of tree planting and receiving returns from harvest. The various time scales identify the periods in which environmental and social benefits occurred as the trees grow and the economic benefits occurred at clearfell (or selective) harvest. This thesis specifically focuses on situations where measured and modelled data is not available, and seeks to increase the scientific rigour of the use of expert and stakeholder opinion in MODSS. The MODSS analyses revealed that forestry in the case study areas had the potential to offer considerable economic, environmental and social benefits to both landholders and the wider community. However, these benefits (and the associated costs) were not viewed as equally important. The MODSS developed in this study addressed these concerns. The benefits and costs of an option were reflected in its performance against the criteria. The degree of importance of the individual criteria varied from minor to high and overriding all other considerations. Criteria against which an option performed highly (the option&#8217;s strengths) were identified, as were criteria against which an option performed poorly (the option&#8217;s weaknesses). When these weaknesses occurred in highly important criteria, these were identified as fatal flaws in the option. The first case study in the Hodgson Creek catchment considered eight forestry options against 17 economic criteria, 12 environmental criteria and 12 social criteria. The second case study on the Atherton Tablelands considered 16 forestry options against eight economic criteria, six environmental criteria and five social criteria. The MODSS analysis identified the most preferred forestry options and the strengths and weaknesses of the options. In both case studies the most preferred options were large or medium-sized plantations with monoculture plantings with an element of non-landholder funding, in the form of government funding, joint ventures or land leasing agreements. These options had the highest performance against the economic criteria at all time scales and satisfactory environmental and social performance. Other forestry options that performed well included plantings focused on under-utilised land areas and salinity prevention areas, agroforestry, and selective harvesting of private native forest. These options generally had a higher level of performance against the social and environmental criteria, but lower levels of performance against economic criteria. These plantings would be undertaken for environmental and social reasons and not for financial returns. The application of MODSS developed in this thesis presents a significant scientific contribution to MODSS methodology. This thesis includes: the use of multiple time-periods to address the temporal differences in the delivery of benefits and costs, the use of NGT and a GDSS to provide a process for rapidly eliciting expert opinion, and the use of the combination of Electr&#233; and weighted sum aggregation methods to provide an overall measure of option performance and to identify fatal flaws in the options.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MODSS</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">stakeholder engagement</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">risk analysis</field><field name="subject">weighting techniques</field><field name="subject">aggregation techniques</field><field name="subject">decision support</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189046</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industry Policy,Finance and the AIDC: Australia from the 1950s to the 1970s</field><field name="creator">Carol Windsor</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis, conceived within a Marxist framework, addresses key conceptual issues in the writing and theorising on industry policy in post second world- war Australia. Broadly, the thesis challenges the way that industry policy on the left of politics (reflected in the social democratic and Keynesian positions) has been constructed as a practical, progressive policy agenda. Specifically, the thesis poses a direct challenge to the primacy of the &#8216;national&#8217; in interpreting the history of industry policy. The challenge is to the proposition that conflicts between national industry and international finance arose only from the mid 1980s. On the contrary, as will be seen, this is a 1960s issue and any interpretation of the debates and the agendas surrounding industry policy in the 1980s must be predicated on an understanding of how the issue was played out two decades earlier. As was the case in the 1960s, industry policy in the 1980s has been isolated from two key areas of interrogation: the role of the nation state in regulating accumulation and the role of finance in industry policy. In the 1950s and more so in the 1960s and early 1970s there was a reconfiguration of financing internationally but it is one that did not enter into industry policy analysis. The central concern therefore is to simultaneously sketch the historical political economy on industry policy from the 1950s through to the early 1970s in Australia and to analytically and empirically insert the role of finance into that history. In so doing the thesis addresses the economic and social factors that shaped the approach to industry finance in Australia during this critical period. The analysis is supported by a detailed examination of political and industry debates surrounding the proposal for, and institution of, a key national intervention in the form of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Industry policy, finance, global, nation state, AIDC, 1960s, Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189307</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ambivalent Fictions: Youth, Irony and Affect in American Smart Film</field><field name="creator">Deborah Thomas</field><field name="description">Smart film, a term coined by Jeffrey Sconce in his 2002 Screen article, &#8220;Irony, Nihilism and the New American &#8216;Smart&#8217; Film&#8221;, refers to a wave of controversial, contemporary American films characterised by irony, quirky black humour, deadpan performance and an observational, blank style. Apart from Sconce, there has been little theorisation on smart cinema within the field of American screen studies. This thesis redresses this gap by providing the first extended study on smart film. It draws on, and adds to, the framework provided by Sconce, via the examination of a particular &#8216;subset&#8217; of smart films concerned with the representation of youth and adolescence. These specifically target a more adult, &#8216;smart&#8217; niche audience, who derive pleasure from their ironic &#8216;cleverness&#8217;, and &#8216;arty&#8217; sensibility. In particular, this project focuses on the way these films are differentiated from more mainstream narrative cinema by their generic, affective and ethical structures. Following Sconce, this thesis analyses the constituents of the &#8216;art of the smart&#8217;&#8212;of the aesthetic strategies that differentiate the smart youth film, and the modes of address that may encourage, or discourage, particular experiences of affectivity and ethical engagement in the films&#8217; portrayals of their youthful, anti-heroic protagonists. This includes a discussion of their cinematic origins, their production contexts with specific reference to institutional shifts in American independent cinema, and the way their reception is particularly aligned to the cultural tastes and consumption patterns of &#8216;Generation X.&#8217; This thesis argues that smart film necessitates the development of more far-reaching ways of theorising the intersection between cinema, genre and youth. It extends the current theorisation on melodrama and the teenpic by arguing that smart film incorporates stylistic and thematic features, which both intersect with these established generic modes for representing youth and the family, and, at the same time, reflect a paradigm shift away from them as a result of their emphasis on irony and black comedy. It explores the cultural significance of their representations of youth, and their familial relationships, and the way this relates to social and cinematic constructions of youth and the family over time. This draws particular attention to their engagement with more serious, socially relevant, and taboo acts of sexual transgression, and how this is problematically mediated by what may appear as an &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; aesthetic of black comedy. Much of the distinction of smart youth films lies in the way they challenge normative modes of cinematic representation via their portrayals of youth, which combine psychological realism with blank, ironic affect. This has specific implications in terms of their spectatorship and reception, and leads to a central concern in this thesis to determine the ways in which irony and distanciation create ambivalent modes of engagement in these films. This is specifically examined in relation to character, drawing on the cognitive framework provided by Murray Smith&#8217;s &#8220;structure of sympathy&#8221;, and the analysis of their ironic, anti-naturalistic strategies of performance, which complicate a realist construction of character subjectivity, authenticity, and allegiance. However, this thesis also argues that an astute examination of smart film&#8217;s formal content and narrative construction often reveals key moments of sincerity, character authenticity, and avenues of empathy that may allow for a momentary emotional connection with character and the filmic world. The final chapter focuses on the ethical dimension of these films, their relationship with nihilism, and the question of whether youth films have a responsibility to offer positive role models and ethical guidance. It discusses the way that irony functions as a strategic gesture, which can offer incisive moral and social criticisms, but is complicated by the lack of cues for how to morally judge, or emotionally relate to, characters and their actions. Overall, smart films&#8217; ambivalence suggests that the spectator may be required to extend their paradigms of response, particularly in the way these films articulate their &#8216;taboo&#8217; content. This necessitates an examination of the dialogic, intersubjective process of the way the materiality of the film intersects with the socialised, contextual body of the spectator to embrace the possibility of a more active, intellectual spectatorship. Specifically, this incorporates an evaluation of the social cognitions, epistemology, and pleasures derived from the contemporary circulation and comprehension of irony, and how this can generate an understanding of smart film in relation to their affective and ethical regimes. Finally, this thesis concludes with an examination of the influence of smart film on television and current post-ironic trends in American cinema.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">smart film, youth, teenpics, genre, irony, affect, ethics, nihilism, spectatorship, post-irony</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189734</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acceptance and Use of the Service Oriented Computing Paradigm: the IT Professionals&#8217; Perspective</field><field name="creator">Ilse Baumgartner</field><field name="description">The thesis &#8220;Acceptance and use of the Service Oriented Computing paradigm: the IT professionals&#8217; perspective&#8221; focuses on the question: what are the critical factors that influence IT professionals&#8217; intentions to accept and use the Service Oriented Computing (SOC) approach to systems development? This work considers IT professionals as the key stakeholders in the SOC acceptance and use process and argues that the acceptance and practical use of SOC depends &#8211; at an early acceptance stage &#8211; primarily on the individual-level acceptance decisions made by senior IT professionals working for an organisation. Consequently, SOC acceptance and use (in its early stage) is seen as a bottom-up process driven, and to a high degree controlled, by the &#8220;early adopters&#8221; (Rogers 1995) of this technological paradigm (i.e. involved senior IT professionals). Although SOC is considered the enabling technological approach in many different future areas (e.g. eBusiness, eGovernment, eScience etc.), very little research exists on the process of practical acceptance of this paradigm, in particular focusing on the perspective of the &#8220;early stage&#8221; key stakeholders of this acceptance process, namely the IT professionals. This thesis consists of four major parts. First, it reviews existing literature on technology acceptance and use and confirms the absence of an established theoretical framework in the domain of individual-level technology acceptance in the IT industry. Second, based on data collected in a series of exploratory interviews with senior IT practitioners, an initial model explaining the acceptance and use of SOC among IT professionals is being proposed. Third, the derived model is revised and reformulated using an eGovernment case study. And forth, based on the refined model, a survey instrument is developed, pilot-tested and administered to senior IT professionals currently using the SOC approach to systems development in their professional work. This thesis makes a contribution to IS research in several ways. While there exists extensive, well-grounded and well-accepted research in the domain of &#8220;IT end-user&#8221; individual-level technology acceptance, the research on technology acceptance in the IT industry (i.e. technology acceptance by the IT professionals) is very limited, and nearly all studies carried out in this IS research field are concerned with established approaches or technologies. The current study is among the few examining the perspective of &#8220;early adopters&#8221; or &#8220;innovators&#8221; (Rogers 1995) instead of investigating the acceptance process of &#8220;early majority&#8221; or even &#8220;late majority&#8221;. Moreover, to the author&#8217;s knowledge it is the first study examining the process of individual-level SOC acceptance with a particular focus on the perspective of the &#8220;early stage&#8221; key stakeholders of this acceptance process, namely the IT professionals. One of the additional strengths of the study is the usage of multiple research methodologies &#8211; exploratory open-ended interviews, qualitative case study and web-based survey. This research is expected to be very interesting to researchers focusing on technology acceptance in general and on technology acceptance in the IT industry in particular. This research might also be of interest to IT practitioners considering to accept and use the SOC approach in their future applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">service oriented computing</field><field name="subject">individual-level technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">technology acceptance in the IT industry</field><field name="subject">SOC acceptance and use model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190244</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adding gears to the RNA machine: discovery and characterisation of new classes of small RNAs in eukaryotes</field><field name="creator">Ryan Taft</field><field name="description">Genome sequencing has yielded unparalleled insights into fundamental biological processes and the genetics that guide them. In contrast to expectations that protein-coding genes would be the primary output of eukaryotic genomes, however, it is now clear that the vast majority of transcription is devoted to noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Although originally regarded as 'transcriptional noise', it is now clear that these transcripts are essential regulators of genetic activity. In this thesis I build upon the hypothesis that the genomes of eukaryotes encode a regulatory 'RNA machine' dominated by ncRNAs. In the Introduction (Chapter 1) I discuss how prior gene models may have inadvertently prevented a full understanding of ncRNAs, review the transcriptional landscape of eukaryotes, and examine the biogenesis and function of small regulatory RNAs. In support of a role for ncRNAs in complex metazoa, Chapter 2 presents data showing a positive correlation between the proportion of non-protein-coding DNA and biological complexity, suggesting that the evolutionary trajectory of intricate developmental phenotypes may have been facilitated by ncRNAs. In the following chapters two more 'gears' are added to the RNA machine. Chapter 3 details the discovery of snoRNA-derived RNAs - an evolutionarily ancient class of Argonaute-assocaited RNA whose biogenesis overlaps with microRNAs (miRNAs) and silencing RNAs (siRNAs). Likewise, Chapter 4 reports a new class of ~18 nt transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs) derived from regions proximal to transcription start sites. tiRNAs are enriched at GC-rich promoters and regions of active transcription, implicating them in transcriptional regulation. Chapter 5 presents evidence that tiRNAs are restricted to metazoa, and describes a model of RNA Polymerase II dependent tiRNA biogenesis. This thesis concludes with a general discussion of the implications of these findings, and the potential development of RNA therapeutics. Gathering evidence suggests that eukaryotic genomes are driven by a complex and interwoven network of RNA regulatory feedback loops. This thesis takes a small step towards developing a complete picture of this system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">genome</field><field name="subject">noncoding DNA</field><field name="subject">noncoding RNA</field><field name="subject">microRNA</field><field name="subject">piRNA</field><field name="subject">silencing RNA</field><field name="subject">transcript initiation RNA</field><field name="subject">small nucleolar RNA</field><field name="subject">sno-derived RNA</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190270</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropsychological Assessment of Recovery after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Karleigh Kwapil</field><field name="description">Mild Traumatic Brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most common forms of acquired neurological damage. However, the term 'mild' TBI is misleading because the physical, cognitive and emotional impairments that can follow from mTBI can be significant. In order to provide objective, prognostic measures for diagnosing the severity of mTBI and identifying individuals who may be at risk for poor outcomes a battery of neuropsychological measures for detecting cognitive impairment was evaluated. The Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) is a collection of tests assessing verbal recall, orientation, processing speed and speed of language comprehension. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RSC has acceptable reliability, validity and sensitivity to cognitive impairment that arises during the acute stages of injury. However, no studies have investigated the predictive validity of this instrument. Moreover it is unclear what additional patient or post injury variables could assist in identifying those individuals who may be at risk of poor neuropsychological outcomes following mTBI. These were among the main issues that were addressed across the five empirical studies in this thesis. A pragmatic, prospective, longitudinal and cross-sectional study of the sequelae of mTBI in patients presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Royal Brisbane and Women's hospital was the basis of this project. The first empirical chapter (chapter 2), examined the psychometric properties of two measures of verbal learning and memory and investigated their potential for discriminating between mTBI and orthopaedic controls. The performance of 93 patients with mTBI and 68 participants with orthopaedic injuries was analysed to identify the number of individuals who performed at ceiling on the Hopkins Verbal Learning test (HVLT-R) versus a 5-word test of immediate and delayed recall. While both of these verbal recall measures were effective in separating the mTBI and orthopaedic groups, overall, the HVLT-R was shown to be a more suitable measure for screening for deficits in verbal learning and memory after mTBI. Given the superiority of the HVLT-R as a measure of verbal learning and memory, chapter 3 aimed to examine whether inclusion of this test could improve the sensitivity of the RSC in mTBI compared to orthopaedic and uninjured control samples. Results were generally within the direction predicted. Significant differences were found between groups on the majority of cognitive indices assessed. Both the orthopaedic and mTBI group performed more poorly than the uninjured group on all measures except the Hopkins delayed recognition. Additional performance decrements shown by the mTBI group compared to the orthopaedic group illustrate that factors beyond the general effects of trauma influence performance and may be related to cognitive impairment specific to sustaining mTBI. Overall it was concluded that the revised RSC is a sensitive instrument deserving investigation in assessing the more long term cognitive effects following mTBI. Chapter 4 applied this sensitive battery for investigation of group and individual recovery of neuropsychological test performance and post-concussive symptom reporting up to 3-months after mTBI. A sample of 30 mTBI participants and 30 uninjured controls were serially assessed on cognitive measures and symptom report scales immediately after injury and after 1-week, 1-month and 3-months. Symptom reporting on the Rivermead post-concussive inventory separated the mTBI and control groups after 1-week but diagnostic accuracy was no greater than chance at 1 and 3-months. In contrast the mTBI group performed more poorly than controls on measures on neuropsychological measures acutely, at 1-week and 1-month, with group differences still evident after 3-months. Nonethless, a trend of progressive recovery over time was seen in the mTBI group. In chapter 5, criteria utilising the concepts of reliable and statistically significant change were applied to the data. Overall, 73% of mTBI patients were impaired on one or more tests acutely. Significant recovery was demonstrated by 20% of mTBI participants by 3-months; however recovery remained incomplete for half of the mTBI participants by 3-months. These results highlighted the importance of an individual approach to the assessment of mTBI and support the notion that a proportion of mTBI cases may have protracted difficulties. Chapter 6 extended these findings by showing that the RSC has prognostic ability. It was found that acute neuropsychological performance on the RSC was a significant predictor of performance on an extended battery at 3-months. The final chapter provides a general discussion and synthesis of the findings. In summary, the present dissertation demonstrated that inclusion of a sensitive measure of verbal recall led to improved diagnostic validity of the RSC. Neuropsychological measures rather than symptom reporting were sensitive in detecting cognitive impairment at 3-months. Analysis of individuals showed that up to 50% of the group had failed to &#8211; demonstrate reliable recovery &#8211; that is, make improvements over and above practice effects after 3-months. Finally, acute neuropsychological performance was predictive of long term performance. Overall, the present thesis has identified a short battery of tests that is suitable for assessment of mTBI within 24 hours and may assist in identifying individuals at risk of poor cognitive outcomes after mTBI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Concussion</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological assessment</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological recovery</field><field name="subject">post concussion syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192563</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Commentary</field><field name="creator">Ian Cresswell</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Nickel-Chelating Fluorinated Lipids for Membrane Protein Monolayer Crystallisations</field><field name="creator">Waleed Hussein</field><field name="description">Abstract 3D crystallisation of membrane proteins presents a bottleneck for the determination of the structures of membrane proteins. Obtaining 3D crystals of membrane proteins is made difficult by a number of factors including the poor solubility and instability of membrane proteins outside of their native membrane environment. 2D crystallisation of membrane proteins offers an alternative to preserve the conformational structure and functional activities of membrane proteins within their native bilayer membranes in 2D arrays from which the structure of membrane proteins can be determined. Different techniques exist for obtaining 2D crystals of membrane proteins including surface crystallisation or more commonly 2D crystallisation by detergent removal (using either dilution, dialysis, hydrophobic resin adsorption or cyclodextrin complexation) to promote reconstitution of the protein molecules within bilayer-forming lipids. Another method which has been emerged and is being used increasingly is the lipid monolayer technique for 2D crystallisation of proteins. The use of lipid monolayers to bind and adsorb proteins is an attractive and increasingly important method for generating high localised concentrations of oriented proteins and protein complexes. These bound proteins can be imaged directly, or they may form 2D crystalline arrays that are amenable to structure determination by single particle analysis or 2D electron crystallography. 2D crystals grown by this technique can also be used to initiate the growth of 3D crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis. Many derivatised lipids have been prepared for use with this technique, incorporating a diverse range of ligands to enable binding to specific proteins. Synthetic lipids containing functionalised head groups that chelate Ni2+ or Cu2+ have also been prepared to bind and orient expressed proteins that contain His-tags. Protein-binding monolayer-forming lipids generally consist of two distinct components: (1) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity to the monolayer and (2) a functionalised hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of protein molecules at the air-water interface. Newer examples of these compounds also incorporate perfluorinated hydrocarbon moieties to confer detergent resistance to these lipids. The present work discusses the chemistry of all these functionalised lipids and their contributions to monolayer 2D protein crystallisation. This thesis focuses on the synthesis of novel nickel-chelating fluorinated lipids to be used as a template for 2D crystallisation of His-tagged membrane proteins at the air/water interface. These monolayer-forming lipids have been designed with three distinct components: (i) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity of the monolayer, (ii) a perfluorinated central core for detergent resistance, and (iii) a nickel-chelating hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of recombinant, polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. Alkylations of fluorinated alcohols used in these syntheses proceed in good yields only with the application of prolonged sonication and, in some cases, in the presence of phase-transfer catalysts. Biophysical properties of Langmuir monolayers formed by our target synthetic fluorinated lipids were studied, comparing the results obtained with those of DOPC and DOGS Ni-NTA as examples of non fluorinated lipids. The Langmuir films were characterised by surface pressure-area isotherms and X-ray reflectometry to show their fluidity, thickness and packing density. The stability of fluorinated lipid monolayers and their ability to resist the solubilisation effects of a number of detergents were investigated using monolayer and affinity grid techniques. Results showed that fluorinated lipids offer an improved resistance to the solubilisation effects of detergents compared with their non-fluorinated counterparts. A number of trials for 2D crystallisation of both soluble and membrane proteins have been performed using fluorinated lipid monolayers. These new synthetic fluorinated lipids were successfully used to obtain 2D crystals of the His-tagged membrane protein BmrA from Bacillus subtillis by the monolayer technique.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">fluorinated lipids</field><field name="subject">monolayer</field><field name="subject">self-assembly proteins</field><field name="subject">2D crystallisation</field><field name="subject">electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">membrane proteins</field><field name="subject">tagged proteins</field><field name="subject">detergent resistant</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192988</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RIPARIAN GROUNDWATER FLOW AND SALT TRANSPORT IN AQUIFER-ESTUARY INTERACTION</field><field name="creator">Mothei Lenkopane</field><field name="description">Estuarine ecosystems are under enormous stress due to rapid coastal developments and climate change. Proper management of these important ecosystems requires a good understanding of their key processes. In this thesis, riparian groundwater-surface water interaction is explored for an aquifer-estuary system primarily by a series of numerical experiments. The work focuses on riparian-scale groundwater flow and salinization. The overall aim of the study was to extend our understanding of aquifer-estuary exchange, which is currently centered on the lower marine estuarine reach, to middle estuaries (i.e., the estuary reach that has variable salinity). The numerical experiments were guided by previous studies and observations made from an exploratory field investigation conducted in and next to Sandy Creek, a macro-tidal estuary incised in the alluvial aquifer of the Pioneer Valley, North-eastern Australia (Longitude 49.11&#176;, Latitude -21.27&#176;). The following observations were made from the field investigation: Sandy Creek estuary experiences a variable salinity regime in its mid reaches that consists of periods of 1) freshwater flushing due to up catchment-derived flooding, 2) persistent freshwater conditions for at least 2 months following the flooding, 3) tidal salinity fluctuations and 4) constant near-seawater salinity; laterally extensive and disconnected aquitards were found to occur at the field site; Sandy Creek had an essentially &#8216;vertical&#8217; bank slope. Numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element modeling code FEFLOW for saturated unsaturated, variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport, to examine the influence of the following factors on aquifer-estuary exchange: a tidally varying estuarine salinity and hydraulic head, a seasonal freshwater flush (i.e., estuary with freshwater and an elevated stage due to an up catchment sourced flood), near estuary aquitard layers, lateral asymmetry (about the estuary centerline) in hydraulic conductivity and regional hydraulic gradients. The simulations neglected seepage face development after numerical experiments showed that for a vertical bank estuary interacting with a sandy loam aquifer, seepage face effects on groundwater flow and associated salinity distribution were minimal. The following observations were drawn from the range of numerical experiments considered. Tidal salinity fluctuations in the estuary (varying between 0 and 1 - i.e., using a relative salinity scale where a salinity of 1 is seawater) produced flow paths and residence times that were distinctly different to the constant seawater salinity case. While the constant average 0.5 salinity case and the corresponding tidally-varying salinity case (i.e., salinity varying between 0 and 1) produced somewhat comparable results in terms of RUC and RLC (RUC represents groundwater discharge to the estuary that originated from recharge to the estuary bank and RLC groundwater discharge to the estuary that originated from recharge through the estuary bed), whereas flow paths and the total salt mass in the aquifer differed. Freshwater flushing simulations indicated that the near-estuary aquifer responds rapidly to a 2-day &#8216;wet season&#8217; flushing event with a short-lived freshwater lens created through freshening of the hyporheic zone. Annual cycling of the seasonal flushing led to significant disruption of the estuary water circulation in the aquifer thereby impacting on residence times, transport pathways, and RUC and RLC, and acting to potentially remobilize groundwater and contaminants previously trapped in continuous and semi-continuous re-circulation cells. Although groundwater flow paths determined using tide-averaged velocity vectors were representative of flow paths from transient tidally driven flow vector field, residence times calculated from the two flow fields were markedly different. The influence of riparian scale aquitards and lateral asymmetry (about the estuary centreline) in hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivity on groundwater flow and associated salinity distribution was also found to be sensitive to estuarine salinity conditions. The results indicate that observations made about aquifer-estuary interaction in the lower estuary may not be directly applicable to the middle estuary. According to the simulations, tidal salinity variations in the estuary are important factors that affect hyporheic-riparian salt transport processes and that the use of a time averaged estuarine salinity as an approximation to variable salinity conditions is unsuitable for the accurate prediction of the near-estuary dynamics in middle estuaries. This study was based on a two dimensional representation of the riparian scale interaction and it is clear that future research needs to focus on the three-dimensionality of the aquifer-estuary system, incorporating spatially and temporally varying flow and transport characteristics. That is, many estuaries are tortuous and the aquifer geology spatially complex such that assumptions required for the two-dimensional section will most likely restrict application to the field.

The soil conditions, together with fluctuations in rainfall distribution, are regarded as the most serious constraints to achieving high and stable grain yields in the rainfed lowland rice ecosystem in this region. Improvements in rainfed lowland rice productivity depend, in part, on improved predictions of water availability, as well as better understanding of soil nutrient and water stress limitations to grain yield. The use of a soil water balance model, in conjunction with the quantification of soil nutrient availability, can help in estimating free water levels in the rice fields, thereby helping determine the duration of the growing period, as well as, helping with predictions of potential yield reduction due to water stress and soil nutrient limitations. Linking the simulated results with Geographic Information System (GIS) can help quantify the spatial pattern of these attributes at a provincial or regional scale. This study was aimed at quantifying the spatial distribution of water availability, including the frequency and severity of water stress development during the growing period, and to estimate the effects of soil fertility and water stress on rice productivity in Savannakhet province in southern Lao PDR. The current status in relation to the variability in field water availability, soil fertility, farm crop management practices and grain yield throughout Savannakhet province were quantified, first by collecting farm data from 53 and 48 farmers&#8217; fields in the 2007 and 2008 cropping seasons, respectively, These farms were selected to be representative of a wide range of soil and climate conditions within the province. The results show that rainfall distribution pattern, soil type and toposequence position of paddy fields, are crucial factors contributing to the temporal variation in field water availability. The overall yield loss due to water stress associated with late season drought was estimated to be rather small (10%, 5% and 3% for the top, middle and bottom toposequence positions of rice fields, respectively) in the 2008 wet season. On the other hand, application of chemical fertilizer has a large effect on final grain yield, with 50 kg N ha-1 and 30 kg P2O5 ha-1 increasing yield by 600 to 800 kg and 800 to 1000kg ha-1 respectively, in the 2007 and 2008 cropping seasons. A new soil water balance (SWB) model that incorporates the effect of low soil clay content on deep percolation, was developed to quantify field water availability and the length of growing period (LGP) for various rainfall lowland rice cropping environments. The model estimates the amount of water stored in a soil profile, the profile being divided into two layers: Layer 1 (0-200 mm) consists of standing water and the topsoil layer, while Layer 2 (200-1000 mm) is the subsoil layer. The SWB model was validated with field experimental data obtained in the 2002 and 2008 cropping seasons. The simulated free water levels were close to those recorded for the observed field data, with a small mean average error, lower root mean square error, and significant correlation coefficient and index of agreement over all sites across the three toposequence positions of paddy fields. Maps of the length, start and end of growing period (LGP, SGP and EGP, respectively) for rainfed lowland rice in Savannakhet province, were developed using the SWB model, with inputs of median weekly climatic data and soil water characteristics. The province was delineated into three main LGP zones with a short LGP zone (less than 21 weeks) in the east, northwest and some rice fields in the south-western corner of the province; an intermediate LGP zone (21 to 24 weeks) was defined in the central and western part of the province; and a long LGP zone (greater than 24 weeks) for the south and for some rice fields in the western part of the province. The variation in the SGP from year-to-year was due largely to the variation in rainfall early in the wet-season (e.g. April), while EGP was strongly dependent upon the clay content of the soils being cropped. The SWB model was combined with other models that estimate yield potential, soil nutrient supply and yield reduction by low soil water level, to characterize and map the suitability zones for rainfed lowland rice in Savannakhet province. The overall results of the model performance on yield estimates were satisfactorily, with a significant correlation coefficient (0.54**) and high index of agreement (0.68) over the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The model classified three main rice agro-ecological zones according to the suitability of climate and soil conditions. The majority of the lowland rice growing areas are classified as moderately suitable to marginally suitable, while the potential area classified as being high suitable is very small. A large potential response of rice yields to fertilizer inputs is predicted for most of rice growing areas in the province. The best sowing time for achieving a high yield, as evaluated by the model, is the first half of June. Appropriate crop phenology and increasing fertilizer use efficiency that matches with water availability and soil conditions in each rice agro-ecological zone, are important in achieving improvements in rice productivity, as substantial improvements in rice fields cannot be achieved by improving water availability alone, where paddy fields are dominated by soils with low level of indigenous fertility. Although the model is capable of quantifying field water availability and crop yield due to the limitations associated with low levels of soil nutrients and water stress, the model has the potential for further improvements in two areas. First, the estimates of water loss need to be modified by incorporating variable factors such as slope of paddy field, which can affects lateral water movement and hence free water level. Second, the model should incorporate some key agronomic variables, such as internal efficiencies and recovery efficiencies of applied fertilizer, which depend on variety, crop management and climatic conditions, and these factors can be modelled.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial variation</field><field name="subject">Water availability</field><field name="subject">Soil nutrient</field><field name="subject">Water constraint</field><field name="subject">Rainfed lowland rice</field><field name="subject">Production</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193528</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biography of Crawford Munro: A vision for Australia's water and a survey of twentieth century Australian science biography</field><field name="creator">Leonard Humphreys</field><field name="description">1. The biography of Crawford Munro (1904-76) describes his early life in Toowoomba and Sydney, and his maturation as an engineer, working for Sydney Water, Sydney Technical College and in the production of Cruiser tanks in World War II. He was a large confident man with a big voice and an optimistic, humorous personality. As the Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales Munro was liberal, fostered humanist studies and developed the School of Engineering with a unique emphasis on water engineering. He recruited excellent staff for research and postgraduate education who led the nation across all phases of hydrology and hydraulics. Munro developed a remarkable, rational solution for flood mitigation at Launceston, and actively promoted research, partly through the Australian Water Research Foundation and the Institution of Engineers, Australia. He was much involved with predicting flood runoff, developing benefit/cost relations for irrigation schemes, which led him into public controversy, and other hydrological projects. Munro&#8217;s attempts to raise social consciousness about water problems, his multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of water resources and his campaigns for the collection of stream and rainfall data helped provide a better basis for proper planning. In his later years he undertook the first Australian environmental impact study. The concluding chapter outlines a vision for the current management of Australia&#8217;s water. Munro posed necessary questions about measuring the supply of water and bringing the demand of water into synchrony with its supply, while providing water security in terms of its availability and quality. He raised the debate about the balance between sustaining environmental flows, utilizing water for agriculture and secondary industry, and maintaining the health of communities. Munro hoped equitable decision making would emerge from public engagement on these issues. 2. Twentieth century science biography in Australia is the province of a group of elite male scientists, whose interests cover wide disciplinary fields; it is focused on popular imagination: health, food and adventure (Antarctica) accounting for fifteen of the seventeen scientists. Empathy for the subject is a significant feature of the nineteen biographers, of whom five are scientists. This small genre is often supported by institutions in small print runs. A key role of biography is to place through science history a more epistemologically plausible version of events. Public discourses of science treated in the essay include conflict about the attribution of scientific discovery, the vocation of the scientist as a contributor to a wider social polity, the light biography sheds on sources of creativity and the evolution of the research and culture of institutions. The biographer attempts to generate a personal portrait of the scientist which conveys authority about the significance and origins of his or her scientific discoveries and their impact in the wider social context. Daniel S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s affirmation of the existential approach which &#8216;emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the human individual&#8217; resonates with the candidate as expressing characteristics of the lives of many Australian scientists in their passion for intellectual discovery, their motivation to self-empowerment, and their readiness top step outside their social conditioning. This essay extends S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s paradigm to the context of Australian science biography and indicates some constraints on its depiction which arise in the practice of writing science biography. Some epistemological issues are raised in the texts, especially when dealing with oral history and family mythology, and thematic, thematic within a chronological framework or chronological structures of the text are compared. The level of detail and context influence the sustainability of the reader&#8217;s interest. Case studies of the biographies written by the candidate (Ian Clunies Ross, Samuel Wadham, Allan Callaghan, Victor Trikojus, Raymond Hoffenberg and Crawford Munro) illustrate issues which arise in the writing of science biography. The dominant question is the relationship of the biographer to the subject, and this determines the voice the reader hears. The motivation of the biographer may arise in varying degrees of empathy felt for the subject. The high affinity the candidate had for Clunies Ross and Hoffenberg causes him to offer a defence against the charge of hagiography, and the selectivity and subjectivity of the biographer is evident in the arrangement and presentation of factual material. The motivation of the biographer is additionally directed to the communication of the subject&#8217;s research outputs to the wider Australian community, and in the case of Callaghan, Wadham and Clunies Ross there was a specific programmatic function of advancing the status of agricultural science. It is argued that the description of the public life of the subject needs to be complemented from the private life if the biographer is &#8216;to view the world through the eyes of the subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">science biography, epistemology, history, science institutions, munro, water, hydrology, environmental sustainability, irrigation, planning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193508</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) Nanoparticle-Based Nucleic Acid Delivery System</field><field name="creator">Yunyi Wong</field><field name="description">There has been much interest in the use of therapeutics based on ribonucleic acid interference(RNAi) to inhibit synthesis of mutant proteins ever since Elbashir et al. (Elbashir, S. M., Harborth, J., Lendeckel, W., Yalcin, A., Weber, K. and Tuschl, T., 2001. Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells. Nature. 411, 494-498.) found that synthetic double stranded small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) can initiate this evolutionarily conserved process in mammalian cells. Since RNAi is able to target single genes and therefore mitigate the underlying molecular pathology of diseases, RNAi-based therapeutics will most likely benefit monogenic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington&#8217;s disease. It is however particularly difficult to deliver exogenous materials such as siRNAs into neurons in vivo as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) isolates the brain from the vascular system and prevents permeation of most materials. Neurons also do not take up exogenous materials readily. Therefore, effective delivery of siRNAs into the brain remains one of the biggest challenges impeding their use as a potential neurotherapeutic. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles are a class of anionic clay materials that have demonstrated great potential as a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) delivery system for a variety of mammalian cell lines due to their unique physiochemical properties. This thesis examined the feasibility of LDH as a siRNA delivery system for cultured neurons and demonstrated that the delivered siRNAs are able to effectively down-regulate synthesis of a target protein with minimal toxicity. Experiments were conducted using double stranded DNAs (dsDNAs) initially, and siRNAs were then used to verify these results. It was shown that nucleic acids(dsDNAs and siRNAs) could successfully intercalate into pristine LDHs to form nucleic acid-LDH complexes that had properties suitable for use as a delivery system in mammalian cells. These studies established that LDHs and nucleic acid-LDH complexes were biocompatible with neurons isolated from embryonic day 17.5 mouse cerebral cortex, suggesting that LDH can be used for nucleic acid delivery into cultured neurons. LDHs were also shown to successfully deliver nucleic acids into a non-neural mammalian cell line (NIH 3T3 cells). Finally, this thesis demonstrated for the first time that LDHs were able to deliver siRNAs into neurons, providing encouraging preliminary evidence that sequence specific gene silencing of the Mus Musculus Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) gene had occurred. However, down-regulation of the DCC protein did not occur consistently, suggesting that further optimisation is needed to improve the efficacy of siRNA-LDH complexes to inhibit expression of target protein in neurons. In future, LDHs should be further developed as an efficient siRNA delivery system for therapeutic gene silencing in the central nervous system using a neurodegenerative disease model such as the Huntington&#8217;s disease mouse model, which closely phenocopies the human disease. This model will allow the in vivo efficacy of these nanoparticles to be tested and subsequently improved in order to deliver siRNAs locally and systematically into the brain.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH)</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Cellular uptake</field><field name="subject">Neurons</field><field name="subject">Neurodegenerative disease</field><field name="subject">Nonviral delivery system</field><field name="subject">RNAi</field><field name="subject">dsDNA-LDH</field><field name="subject">siRNA-LDH</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194019</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Requirements on Nonlinear Optical Quantum Gates</field><field name="creator">Mingyin Patrick Leung</field><field name="description">Quantum information science has shown that computers which exploit the quantum nature of particles, namely quantum computers, can outperform contemporary computers in some computational tasks. The fundamental building blocks of a quantum computer are quantum logical gates and quantum bits (qubits). Previous research has shown that the optical approach to quantum computing is promising. However, linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) schemes require a huge amount of resource, which makes large scale LOQC impractical, and hence there have been renewed interests in nonlinear optical quantum computing schemes, where less resource is required. The performance of these quantum gates depends on the properties of the nonlinear media. However, requirements on some of the properties for high performance quantum gates are not fully known. This thesis intends to bridge this gap of knowledge and examines the necessary conditions on several types optical nonlinearities that are common in two-qubit quantum gates schemes. These types of nonlinearities are, namely two-photon absorption, $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity and $\chi^{(3)}$ cross-Kerr nonlinearity. The two-photon absorption based quantum Zeno gate is modeled in this thesis. It is shown that for practical absorbers, the photon loss significantly lowers the quantum fidelity of the Zeno gate. Nevertheless, this thesis proposes to use the Zeno gate for fusing optical cluster states. With the best theoretical estimate of single photon loss in the absorbers, the Zeno gate can outperform linear optical schemes. This thesis also proposes to embed the Zeno gate in the teleportation-type of two-qubit gate, namely GC-Zeno gate, such that the success rate of the gate can be traded off for higher gate fidelity. The effect of some mode matching error and detector inefficiency on the GC-Zeno gate are also considered here. It is shown that the photon loss requirement as well as the mode matching requirement are both stringent for having a fault tolerant GC-Zeno gate. This thesis models some of the properties of a $\chi^{(3)}$ optical medium and explores how they affect the fidelity of the cross-Kerr nonlinearity based quantum gate. This thesis shows that for a cross-Kerr medium with fast time response but negligible wave dispersion, the medium would induce spectral entanglement between the input photons and this significantly lowers the fidelity of the quantum gate. Nevertheless, when the dispersion has a stronger effect than the time response, and if phase noise is negligible, it is possible to achieve a quantum gate with high fidelity. However, the noise is actually significant, and this thesis suggests that spectral filtering can be applied to prohibit the occurrence of the noise. The requirements on employing optical $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity for quantum computing are also examined. This study models the spectral effects of a $\chi^{(2)}$ medium on its efficiency. It is shown in this thesis that since the Hamiltonian of the medium does not commute at different times, the unitary operation should be modeled by a Dyson series, which leads to undesired spectral entanglement that lowers the efficiency of the medium. However, in the case of periodical poling, the unitary operation can be modeled by a Taylor series, where under some phase matching conditions, the medium can have a high efficiency. Furthermore, this thesis proposes a Bell measurement scheme and a quantum gate scheme based on $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity that can always outperform linear optics even when the nonlinearity strength is weak. In the case of sufficiently strong nonlinearity, a quantum gate with high success rate can be achieved. In summary, this thesis models some of the properties of two-photon absorbers, $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearity, and shows that it is possible to achieve the conditions required for high performance quantum gates, however these conditions are experimentally challenging to meet.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">quantum computing</field><field name="subject">optical nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">two-photon absorption</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194253</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buddhist Meditation Through the Medium of the Internet</field><field name="creator">Joanne Miller</field><field name="description">Since its inception, the Internet has served as a powerful medium for the dissemination of religious information and the creation of religious communities. Cyberspace now represents an important global paradigm shift in the way religion is conducted. This research provides a sociological account of the affordances the Internet contributes to religious life by examining the ways in which it has influenced the conduct or practices associated with Buddhism. In particular, it assesses the extent to which the rituals constitutive of the Buddhist practice of meditation have been achieved by the Cybersangha, the term Buddhists use for the online Buddhist community. The thesis argues that the Internet is not well suited to the facilitation of particular types of religious understanding and that there are clear limitations to its ability to provide the shared ritualistic experience necessitated by meditation. This is due to the fact that current technology can enable ritual only to a limited degree, and to the ways in which the textual nature of the Internet poses problems for religious experience of an intuitive, non-mediated nature. For these reasons, despite the fact that many websites advertise &#8216;online meditation&#8217; and despite the strong attempts of some communities to use the Internet as a meditational medium, online meditation cannot be fully facilitated by the Internet. Since a key method by which a Buddhist attains understanding of reality is the use of the body in a meditative act, the inability to provide for embodiment means that the Internet can never offer an experiential equivalent to that of an offline environment. The lack of this experiential aspect means that it cannot in turn provide for holistic, religious communion. As such, there needs to be a further philosophical and practical appraisal of the capabilities of the Internet in general, and as a medium by which a religious experience can be engendered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">22 Philosophy and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">Buddhist meditation online, internet, ritual, religion online, online religion, online ritual, community, cyberspace, religious experience, religious use of the body, authority, authenticity, religion and the internet, meditating in cyberspace, zen, buddh</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194261</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of one-dimensional quantum gases</field><field name="creator">Andrew Sykes</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study the physics of quantum many-body systems confined to one-dimensional geometries. The work was motivated by the recent success of experimentalists in developing atom traps, capable of restricting the motion of the individual atoms to a single spatial dimension. Specifically, we look at aspects of the one-dimensional Bose gas including; excitation spectrum, correlation functions, and dynamical behaviour. In Chapter \ref{ch:excitation1D} we consider the Lieb-Liniger model of interacting bosons in one-dimension. We numerically solve the equations arising from the Bethe ansatz solution for the exact many-body wave function in a finite-size system of up to twenty particles for attractive interactions. We discuss novel features of the solutions, including deviations from the well-known string solutions due to finite size effects. We present excited state string solutions in the limit of strong interactions and discuss their physical interpretation, as well as the characteristics of the quantum phase transition that occurs as a function of interaction strength in the mean-field limit. Our results are compared to those obtained via exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a truncated basis. In Chapter \ref{ch:g2} we analytically calculate the spatial nonlocal pair correlation function for an interacting uniform one dimensional Bose gas at finite temperature and propose an experimental method to measure nonlocal correlations. Our results span six different physical realms, including the weakly and strongly interacting regimes. We show explicitly that the characteristic correlation lengths are given by one of four length scales: the thermal de Broglie wavelength, the mean interparticle separation, the healing length, or the phase coherence length. In all regimes, we identify the profound role of interactions and find that under certain conditions the pair correlation may develop a global maximum at a finite interparticle separation due to the competition between repulsive interactions and thermal effects. In Chapter \ref{ch:casimirdrag} we study the drag force below the critical velocity for obstacles moving in a superfluid. The absence of drag is well established in the context of the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii theory. We calculate the next order correction due to quantum and thermal fluctuations and find a non-zero force acting on a delta-function impurity moving through a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate at all subcritical velocities and at all temperatures. The force occurs due to an imbalance in the Doppler shifts of reflected quantum fluctuations from either side of the impurity. Our calculation is based on a consistent extension of Bogoliubov theory to second order in the interaction strength, and finds new analytic solutions to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a gray soliton. In Chapter \ref{ch:solitons} we study the effect of quantum noise on the stability of a soliton. We find the soliton solutions exactly define the reflectionless potentials of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. This results in complete stability of the solitons in a purely one dimensional system. We look at the modifications to the density profile of a black soliton due to quantum fluctuations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Many-body quantum theory, one-dimensional, ultra-cold atoms, Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, solitons</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194384</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in the Cultural Identity of German Settlers of the Logan and Maroochy Rivers, Queensland, 1860-1914</field><field name="creator">Jasmine Sommer</field><field name="description">This thesis concentrates on the 1860s migration and settlement experience of the first German settlers of Gramzow on Queensland&#8217;s Logan River. It also describes the internal migration of some among them to the North Arm of the Maroochy River in the early 1880s. The latter journey was undertaken in the company of other Germans from the Logan River district and formed part of a pattern of cluster and chain migration to the North Coast. The first chapter in this thesis discusses the early German settlers&#8217; decision to migrate from their homelands, and their economic and societal reasons for migration. The role played by Johann Christian Heussler in the Germans&#8217; choice of Queensland as a destination, and his contributions to the economic development of Queensland through his position as Emigration Agent to the German States, are reviewed. This thesis also attempts to bring balance to the reputation of Godeffroy and Son, the Hamburg shipping line engaged by Heussler, which brought most of the German settlers to Queensland in the 1860s. The company&#8217;s visible commercial strengths such as their size and experience in the Pacific, and their private, internal weaknesses such as failure to adopt new technologies, are examined. Conditions on the Godeffroy vessels are compared with the conditions on ships sailing from Hamburg to America. This approach avoids the usual comparison of German with British sailing ships coming into Moreton Bay. Britain&#8217;s exemplary standards for passenger health were beyond the reach of emigrant fleets who operated under Hamburg&#8217;s older regulations. The research concludes that, in the early 1860s, conditions on the Godeffroy ships for Queensland were superior to Hamburg ships for New York. Furthermore, this thesis describes the 1868 German settlement of Gramzow on the Logan River and compares it to Bethania. The significance of Queensland&#8217;s 1868 lands legislation to the German settlers is explored. It is suggested that the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act is connected to the U.S. Homestead Act, 1862, and a comparison is drawn between the Australian, American and Canadian lands settlement legislation. This comparison enables the further suggestion that homestead selectors of the Logan were part of an international group of homesteaders whose occupational identity was tied to opening the land to agricultural smallholding at little cost through many similar or identical legislative rules that predominantly impacted their economic standing positively. How land orders enabled Logan settlers to increase their land holdings is discussed, as are the negative aspects of the lands legislation such as the upper 160 acre limit on land holding. The migration of early German settlers of the Logan district north to Maroochy occurred under Queensland&#8217;s 1876 lands legislation. This thesis examines the settlement of Germans on the Canando Run along the North Arm of the Maroochy River in the early 1880s, and describes their settlement conditions. Their motives for moving are examined, how the discovery of gold at Gympie affected them is explored, and the establishment of three German businesses at Maroochy is described. A chart comparing the settlers&#8217; land holdings on the Logan with those at Maroochy illustrates that by moving north, some settlers were able to increase their land holdings threefold. The disappearance of Deutschtum (&#8216;German culture&#8217;) after the turn of the century is examined in the final chapter. This thesis asks whether it is appropriate to continue to use the term &#8216;assimilation&#8217; when speaking of Queensland&#8217;s German settler community before and during the First World War. The term appears to draw a veil over the political and economic subjugation of the community during this period. The thesis proposes that it was easier to survive the difficulties of war in rural rather than in urban communities. Although the historiography of the German settlers of Queensland supports an academic conversation on topics such as German emigration, land acquisition and settlement, this thesis focuses on issues outside the boundaries of the current academic thrust. These issues include the settlement of Gramzow in 1868, the homestead provisions in the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act and their origins in lands legislation in America, the services provided through Johann Christian Heussler by the German emigrant shipping line &#8216;Godeffroy and Son,&#8217; the settlement of the North Arm of the Maroochy River by Logan Germans in the early 1880s, and a rejection of the term &#8216;assimilation&#8217; to describe the eradication of German culture in Queensland after 1914. The leitmotif of this thesis is cultural identity and it explores change in German settlers through various aspects of their identity such as their psychological identity, diasporic experiences, language, and legal and political identity after taking citizenship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">German settlers of Queensland, Logan River, Maroochy, German migration to Queensland, Crown Lands Acts, naturalization, citizenship, cultural identity, assimilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194356</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Group opinion change and reintegration of deviant group members</field><field name="creator">Khai Huei Chan</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigates two theoretically novel processes of change in groups relevant to agents for change. Specifically, it examines the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on group members&#8217; evaluation of ingroup change-agents. Group opinion change is operationalized as the group adopting the position advocated by a change-agent, and reintegration is operationalized as the group responding more positively towards a change-agent. These formulations of change processes within groups extend past theorizing in opinion deviance research (e.g., Festinger, 1950; Schachter, 1951; Marques &amp; Paez, 1994) by a) examining how contextual differences that result from changes in the group may affect group members&#8217; reactions to opinion deviates, and b) considering contingencies that result in acceptance or rejection of change-agents and their messages. In addition, this thesis investigates the psychological processes that may mediate and moderate the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on appraisals of change-agents. Specifically, it considers attributed motives of change-agents (i.e., perceived constructiveness; Hornsey, 2005), and target prototypicality (e.g., Hogg, 1993; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987) as two possible mediators of these novel effects. Finally, group members&#8217; identification with the group is examined as a moderator of these processes. Chapter 3 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of group opinion change on the evaluation of change-agents. Experiment 1 (N=100) was a scenario-based study that had a change-agent express a non-conformist view of giving water to an outgroup state at a time when the ingroup state was experiencing a water crisis. Experiment 2 (N=103) was a scenario-based study that looked at a change-agent who expressed pro-immigration views to the ingroup country at an earlier time when popular attitudes toward immigration were poor. In both experiments the deviants were marginalized initially because they endorsed non-conformist opinions. Depending on the condition, group opinions either shifted toward the positions advocated by the deviants or remained unchanged. Results showed group members&#8217; target evaluations shifted as a function of group opinion change. Target evaluations became less favourable in Experiment 1, and more favourable in Experiment 2. There also was evidence that increased perceived constructiveness mediated more favourable target evaluations in Experiment 2. Chapter 4 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of reintegration and group members&#8217; identification on the evaluation of change-agents. Both Experiments 3 (N=103) and 4 (N=94) involved a scenario where there was a severe drought in the ingroup state. In Experiment 3, a deviant politician argued for more investment on water infrastructure 10 years earlier when water shortage was not a critical problem. Thus, the politician expressed a minority opinion. In Experiment 4, a deviant water commissioner expressed a controversial opinion to give water to an outgroup state at the height of the drought. Both deviants were marginalized/excluded initially by the group. Reintegration was manipulated by showing that popular support for the deviant had increased (Experiment 3) or the deviant was reinstated (Experiment 4), or the group did not increase support for the deviant at all (not reintegrated). Results showed that high identifiers evaluated the deviant less positively, and perceived the deviant as more destructive after he or she was reintegrated than when marginalization continued. Further, perceived destructiveness mediated the effects of reintegration and identification on trait evaluations. Experiment 4 also showed that high identifiers were less willing to support change after the deviant was reintegrated, than when marginalization continued. Finally, Chapter 5 tested the interactive effects of group opinion change and reintegration on evaluation of change-agents. I also assessed group members&#8217; responses to change-agents in light of the group&#8217;s resistance to change even though the change-agents were right and the groups were wrong. Experiment 5 was a scenario-based study in a minimal-groups situation that had a deviant arguing for a more equitable research funding than the existing distribution. Experiment 6 was a scenario-based study on the disagreement between Galileo Galilei and the Catholic Church on planetary motion. Again, the deviants initially were marginalized by the groups. For opinion change, the groups either adopted or rejected the deviants&#8217; opinions. For reintegration, the groups either treated the deviants more favourably or continued to reject them. Results showed that either opinion change or reintegration was sufficient to defuse negativity towards the deviants. More importantly, group members continued mistreating the deviants when the groups rejected opinion change and reintegration. That is, negativity towards the deviants was highest when opinion was unchanged, and marginalization continued. Overall, this thesis shows that group members&#8217; evaluations of deviant agents for change can shift as a function of group opinion change and reintegration. Group opinion change and/or reintegration defuse negativity toward change-agents in the absence of psychological threat (i.e., perceived destructiveness). However, if threat is present, opinion change or reintegration may ironically elicit more group members&#8217; negativity towards these targets. This thesis also contributes to the literature by showing how change promotes or inhibits group members&#8217; endorsement of change-agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Deviance</field><field name="subject">Dissent</field><field name="subject">Group Opinion change</field><field name="subject">Deviant Reintegration</field><field name="subject">Rejection</field><field name="subject">Threat</field><field name="subject">Criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194547</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Islamic Conceptualisations of Press Freedom in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Nerawi Sedu</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the conceptions of press freedom from the Islamic perspective. It examined how certain segments of Malaysian society, including government officers, religious leaders, members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of political parties, perceive press freedom in their country. Compared to previous studies on media freedom or press freedom in Malaysia, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of variables significantly related to the conceptualisation and practice of press freedom, which include economic development, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and globalisation. One significant difference between this study and previous studies was the specific examination of Islamic conceptions of press freedom, which represents a major contribution to existing knowledge. As Malaysia is a complex multi-racial and multi-religious nation, factors such as national ideologies and cultural values were addressed when examining conceptions of press freedom. Due to the focus of the study, two types of framework were utilised: an Islamic theoretical framework and media theories developed by Western scholars. Methodologically, this study employed an ethnographic approach for analysing Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom. A combination of three qualitative research techniques - in-depth face-to-face interviews, examination of archival documents, and personal observations - was utilised to investigate the issues identified in relation to perceptions of press freedom in Malaysia. In-depth face-to-face interviews involved the participation of staff and members from ten organisations and individuals who were not affiliated with these organisations. The organisations involved in this study were: Ministry of Internal Security Malaysia (MOIS); Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (IKIM); Islamic Da&#8217;wah Foundation Malaysia (YADIM); Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM); Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM); Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ); Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM); Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS), People&#8217;s Justice Party (PKR); and Puteri UMNO. The archival documents analysed in this study were gathered from these ten organisations. However, due to certain organisational policies and security concerns, personal observations were only conducted at eight organisations, IKIM, YADIM, ABIM, JIM, CIJ, SUARAM, PAS and PKR. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the data analysis were triangulated to ascertain the extent to which the information obtained was consistent or inconsistent across sources. The findings of the study showed that there were diverse views among respondents on what constitutes an Islamic press freedom in a multi-racial and multi-religious Malaysia. Due to the different levels of Islamic understanding and divergent interpretations of Islam among Muslims, especially among members of political parties, this study also found that the Islamic theory of press freedom is a highly contested concept. More often than not, the respondents of these organisations claimed that Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom should be based on their personal versions of Islam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom, Islamic perspective, tawhid, conservatism, liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194709</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching the secretome of Opisthorchis viverrini for growth factor-like molecules</field><field name="creator">Michael Smout</field><field name="description">Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or cancer of the bile ducts, is extremely prevalent in people from Laos and Thailand whose staple diet is uncooked fish which harbour the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. There is no stronger link between a parasite and cancer than that between O. viverrini and CCA. Indeed WHO data suggests that one in six infected people contract liver cancer derived from the fluke. In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the fluke&#8217;s excretory/secretory (ES) proteins are mitogenic and likely make significant contributions to the initiation of CCA. To identify these carcinogenic components I undertook two distinct yet related approaches - (1) traditional protein purification methods to separate ES products, specifically targeting mitogenic proteins, and, (2) bioinformatic screening of 5,000 expressed sequences tags (ESTs) and ES proteins characterized by shotgun proteomic approaches, searching for homologues of molecules that are associated with human cancers. The protein purification approach utilized a cell proliferation assay that I developed for measuring cell replication rates in NIH-3T3 fibroblast and human CCA (KKU-100) cell lines stimulated with ES products. ES products were separated by a combination of ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, size exclusion and a final ion exchange polishing chromatography steps. ES products and chromatographically separated ES proteins were added to cultured cells to observe mitogenic activity. A four-step purification process resulted in the isolation of 23 and 31 kDa proteins that stimulated cell proliferation at just picomolar quantities. These proteins account for a very small proportion of the total protein biomass (6 ppm and 39 ppm respectively) secreted by the parasite. Their identities are currently being explored using alternate proteomic approaches. Some growth factors bind to heparin, so an alternative purification process was developed using a heparin affinity column to purify ES mitogens. In combination with ion exchange chromatography a 20 kDa heparin-binding protein was identified using tandem mass spectrometry as a member of the sperm-coating protein 65 (SCP)-like extracellular proteins, also called SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc766 (SCP/TAPS; Pfam accession number no. PF00188). The O. viverrini heparin-binding SCP/TAPs protein shared similarity with secreted proteins from other parasitic helminths including the hookworm activation-associated protein family, some of which are known to bind to host cells. In silico screening of the O. viverrini ESTs and ES peptides generated by mass spectrometry for proteins associated with cell proliferation and cancer revealed numerous secreted proteins of interest. One of these proteins shared identity with granulin, a vertebrate growth factor. The cDNA corresponding to this protein was termed Ov-grn-1. The predicted molecular characteristics of Ov-GRN-1 (isoelectric point and molecular weight) corresponded with the biochemical properties of the semi-purified mitogen that was chromatographically purified from ES products. Recombinant Ov-GRN-1 was expressed in E. coli in inclusion bodies and the purified denatured protein was refolded to produce a soluble protein. Refolded Ov-GRN-1 stimulated proliferation of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts at nanomolar concentrations and induced shape changes in affected cells. Antibodies raised to recombinant Ov-GRN-1 inhibited the ability of O. viverrini ES products to induce proliferation of fibroblasts and the KKU-100 CCA cell line in vitro, indicating that Ov-GRN-1 is the major growth factor present in O. viverrini ES products. This is the first report of a secreted growth factor from a parasitic worm that induces proliferation of host cells, and supports a role for this fluke protein in establishment of a tumourigenic environment that may ultimately manifest as CCA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Opisthorchis viverrini</field><field name="subject">Liver Fluke</field><field name="subject">Cholangiocarcinoma</field><field name="subject">bile duct cancer</field><field name="subject">ES products</field><field name="subject">Parasite</field><field name="subject">granulin</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Mitogen</field><field name="subject">Carcinogen</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194967</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualization, design, and scaling of drop generation in coflow processes</field><field name="creator">Manuela Duxenneuner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drop formation, coflow, monodispersity, scaling, dimensionless numbers, microfluidics, microPIV, hydroxypropyl-ether guar gum, Tween, sunflower oil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194990</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancing Sustainability in Tourism Destinations with a Complex Adaptive Systems Approach Based on Systems Dynamics Modelling</field><field name="creator">Karin Schianetz</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the potential of a complex adaptive systems (CASs) approach based on system dynamics modelling (SDM) to add value to the currently used assessment tools and monitoring practices for tourism sustainability in an effort to advance sustainable development in tourism destinations. While many different concepts and tools for the assessment of sustainability have developed, most of them do not take the complexity and dynamics of tourism destinations into account. It is argued in this thesis that these linear tools need to be complemented with new approaches that can deal with uncertainty, non-linearity and unexpected changes. New knowledge from ecosystem research, which is derived from complex systems theory, suggests that tourism destinations are indeed social-ecological systems, which need to be viewed and studied as CASs. In recent years tourism researchers have acknowledged the necessity to view tourism as a system with interconnected elements, and have discussed the unpredictability of these tourism systems. CASs approaches, which have been successfully applied by ecologists and economists in other areas, are indicated for tourism management, but have been rarely used in order to promote sustainable tourism development and planning. Appropriate methodologies and frameworks for the implementation of CASs approaches into the tourism context are still lacking. Therefore this thesis addresses the aforementioned challenges as follows: &#8226; A critical review of the concepts and tools currently used for the advancement and assessment of sustainability in tourism destinations is presented. The review evaluates the suitability of assessment tools for specific sites and situations, and develops guidelines for tool selection. It is concluded that for particular purposes linear assessment tools need to be combined or complemented with tools that can deal with complexity and dynamics. Tools covered include sustainability indicators, environmental impact assessment, life cycle assessment, environmental audits, ecological footprints, multi-criteria analysis and adaptive environmental assessment. &#8226; The use of sustainability indicator as one of the most promoted assessment tools for sustainable development in tourism destination is explored further. A systemic indicator system (SIS) methodology based on a CASs approach as an alternative to linear assessments is developed. This methodology is tested using a case study of a holiday eco-village near Lamington National Park in Queensland. The research findings suggest that the SIS has the potential to enhance system understanding and adaptive management of tourism destinations, and can foster collective learning processes amongst stakeholders. &#8226; A framework is developed for a Learning Tourism Destination (LTD) based on the concept of the Learning Organisation, and using SDM as a tool for strategic planning and the promotion of organisational learning. The concept of the LTD is discussed on the basis of 6 case studies, where SDM has been applied primarily for predictive reasons, and through evaluation of the potential of SDM as a tool for the implementation and enhancement of collective learning processes. The results reveal that SDM is capable of promoting communication between stakeholders and stimulating organisational learning. It is argued that the effectiveness of SDM may be greatly increased through incorporation in the foundation of an LTD. &#8226; A practical approach for the implementation of an LTD is presented. Preliminary results from a case study undertaken at the Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia are discussed. Surveys were conducted to verify if the LTD forms a useful framework for fostering consensus building, dialogue and collective learning processes amongst stakeholders. The preliminary results of the study suggest that the implementation of an LTD on the Ningaloo Coast will improve the capacity of the local industry to take more responsibility for the sustainable development, and thus has the potential to enable a more effective transition to sustainability in the region. Through its multi-methodological approach, this thesis demonstrates the importance of considering tourism destinations as CASs. New concepts and assessment tools for sustainable tourism are needed that acknowledge the complex and dynamic nature of tourism and tourism development. Together, the SIS methodology and the LTD framework provide an initial platform from which to conduct further research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">complex adaptive systems</field><field name="subject">Organisational Learning</field><field name="subject">Sustainability Assessment</field><field name="subject">sustainability indicators</field><field name="subject">System Dynamics Modelling</field><field name="subject">Tourism destinations</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197009</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Islamic Publication Industry in Modern Indonesia: Intellectual Transmission, Ideology, and the Profit Motive</field><field name="creator">Akh Muzakki</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of the relationship between the intellectual transmission of Islam, the cultivation of Islamic ideology, and the accumulation of profit within the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia. In order to investigate the relationship between these three aspects, this study concentrates on print media, with a particular focus on printed books and magazines. It is engaged with the central problem of how this Islamic industry posits itself in dealing with its role in transmitting Islamic teachings as well as developing certain kinds of Islamic ideology and in dealing with its capacity as an economic and business activity which is theoretically oriented to profit-making. The Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia has become an increasingly important area of interest. A number of scholarly works have appeared which allow us to understand better some of the features of the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia. A gap still remains, however, due to the fact that these studies have had only one focus of analysis, the ideological inclinations of different sections of the print media. As a result, fundamental problems remain, especially in connection to an examination of any relationship between the three issues indicated earlier. This thesis is an attempt to fill this gap in understanding the revival of the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia. It incorporates two foci of analysis, that is, an ideological and political economy approach, to uncover the material and non-material dimensions of the Islamic publication industry emerging in modern Indonesia. This study finds that the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia performs well through its high sales and significant contribution to the development of varied Islamic ideologies, and plays a unique role in the print publication industry in general. This industry posits itself not only as a profitable business enterprise but also as a significant da`wah (religious proselytising) unit. This mode of positing affects the way the industry deals with three key aspects of its publishing activities noted earlier. The study further demonstrates that the actualisation of these dual purposes occurs through the process of the so-called commodification of Islamic ideas and expressions within the print publication industry. The commodification of Islam itself refers, in fact, to a commercialisation which involves transforming Islamic faith, ideas, expressions and symbols into a real, exchanged commodity available for production, consumption or sale for profit. So, the Islamic print publication industry presents a commodified form of Islam in which Islamic teachings and the cultivation of Islamic ideologies become a real, exchanged commodity for profit collection. In transforming the concept of da`wah into the publication industry, Islamic publishers differ from one another, however. This difference can be seen through the diverse ways in which Islam and Muslim practices have been commodified as the major saleable commodity for publication. Likewise, all Islamic publishers have commodified different aspects of Islam and Muslim practices as the main materials for their own publication. People are presented, as a result, with different ideologies of Islam, from tolerant and progressive to fundamentalist-jihadist bents. This phenomenon develops similarly in both Islamic books and magazines. When there is contradiction particularly between the ideology and the market (profit), however, Islamic publishers develop a so-called &#8220;negotiated market&#8221;. This conception refers to the notion that Islamic publishing houses are certainly oriented to the market but at the same time they have to negotiate it with their ideology. For them, the market is so important that the decision to publish manuscripts has to consider it. The market is not everything for them, however, as it has to be decided whether the material in question contributes or discourages the development of the variety of Islamic ideology each of those Islamic publishers adopt. Attempts to understand better the Islamic publication industry with the increasing production and consumption of its products, books or magazines, in modern Indonesia need, therefore, an enriched theoretical perspective. This study shows us that a combined theoretical framework invoking both ideological and political economy aspects is useful in developing such an enriched theoretical perspective to address the interplay between these three aspects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic publication industry, modern Indonesia, Islamic ideology, da`wah, commodification, book, magazine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196965</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the effectiveness of differing levels of extension assistance in improving the adoption and management of small-scale forestry in Leyte Island, the Philippines</field><field name="creator">John Baynes</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of an agroforestry extension program to smallholder farmers on Leyte Island, the Philippines. The imperative for reforestation is well recognised in the Philippines and was the impetus for this program which provided farmers with assistance to establish and silviculturally manage timber trees on their land. Because the cost-effectiveness of agroforestry extension is increased if farmers develop self-efficacy without extensive training, the extension program was offered in two regimes to test the necessity for extended assistance. In the extended assistance regime, farmers were offered on-site assistance to collect seed, grow seedlings, prepare sites and establish trees, whereas in the limited assistance regime, farmers were only offered assistance to collect seed and grow seedlings. Descriptive statistics were collected of farmers&#8217; acceptance of technology and the manner in which technology was adapted to suit their personal circumstances. Translated conversations between farmers and extension staff also provided a rich source of data which provided insights into farmers&#8217; motivation. Extension activities were reviewed at a mid-program workshop, a final on-site inspection and an end-of-program workshop. Farmers responded positively to the extended assistance program which helped them to grow and out-plant seedlings. The limited assistance program was relatively unsuccessful. Overall, the extension program was successful in shifting the initiative for further planting from extension staff to participating farmers. However, farmers showed little interest in applying silvicultural thinning or pruning to existing plantations of trees because extension advice was not congruent with their existing mental models of these procedures. Systems modelling of socio-economic variables which had been found to affect program outcomes was used to predict critical success factors. A key constraint to program recruitment was found to be farmers&#8217; perception of harvest security, even when their needs for technology and planting materials are met. Modelling also cast doubt on the usefulness of written extension materials and emphasised the necessity for extended face-to-face technical assistance. Although conducted in Leyte, the findings of this research provide guidance for issues which affect the adoption of agroforestry both in the Philippines and in other countries. The research found that it was possible to recruit and motivate farmers without providing material incentives. If farmers experienced unexpected problems, providing extended face-to-face contact and assistance was critical if catastrophic losses of participating farmers were to be avoided. The failure of attempts to introduce advanced-age silviculture also indicated a need to elicit farmers&#8217; mental models as a precursor or parallel enquiry to extension activities. In a situation where little was initially known about farmers&#8217; understanding of agroforestry technology or the variables which affect their acceptance or rejection of extension assistance, the results of this research have shown that it is possible to build the capacity of farmers to establish timber trees. This result is in contrast to the acknowledged failure of the logging concession system in the Philippines and the difficulties faced by some industrial plantations and community-based programs. This investigation has shown that an opportunity exists to lift the level of tree planting in Leyte, provided that system variables which are either critical success factors or impediments are addressed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">extension program</field><field name="subject">expert group</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">small-scale nursery</field><field name="subject">Swietenia macrophylla</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">silviculture</field><field name="subject">systems modelling</field><field name="subject">Bayesian belief network</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197047</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Materials Informatics Workbench for Expediting the Discovery of Novel Compound Materials</field><field name="creator">Kwok Wai Steny Cheung</field><field name="description">This project presents a Materials Informatics Workbench that resolves the challenges confronting materials scientists in the aspects of materials science data assimilation and dissemination. It adopts an approach that has ingeniously combined and extended the technologies of the Semantic Web, Web Service Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL) and Open Archive Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE). These technologies enable the development of novel user interfaces and innovative algorithms and techniques behind the major components of the proposed workbench. In recent years, materials scientists have been struggling with the challenge of dealing with the ever-increasing amount of complex materials science data that are available from online sources and generated by the high-throughput laboratory instruments and data-intensive software tools, respectively. Meanwhile, the funding organizations have encouraged, and even mandated, the sponsored researchers across many domains to make the scientifically-valuable data, together with the traditional scholarly publications, available to the public. This open access requirement provides the opportunity for materials scientists who are able to exploit the available data to expedite the discovery of novel compound materials. However, it also poses challenges for them. The materials scientists raise concerns about the difficulties of precisely locating and processing diverse, but related, data from different data sources and of effectively managing laboratory information and data. In addition, they also lack the simple tools for data access and publication, and require measures for Intellectual Property protection and standards for data sharing, exchange and reuse. The following paragraphs describe how the major workbench components resolve these challenges. First, the materials science ontology, represented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), enables, (1) the mapping between and the integration of the disparate materials science databases, (2) the modelling of experimental provenance information acquired in the physical and digital domains and, (3) the inferencing and extraction of new knowledge within the materials science domain. Next, the federated search interface based on the materials science ontology enables the materials scientists to search, retrieve, correlate and integrate diverse, but related, materials science data and information across disparate databases. Then, a workflow management system underpinning the WSBPEL engine is not only able to manage the scientific investigation process that incorporates multidisciplinary scientists distributed over a wide geographic region and self-contained computational services, but also systematically acquire the experimental data and information generated by the process. Finally, the provenance-aware scientific compound-object publishing system provides the scientists with a view of the highly complex scientific workflow at multiple-grained levels. Thus, they can easily comprehend the science of the workflow, access experimental information and keep the confidential information from unauthorised viewers. It also enables the scientists to quickly and easily author and publish a scientific compound object that, (1) incorporates not only the internal experimental data with the provenance information from the rendered view of a scientific experimental workflow, but also external digital objects with the metadata, for example, published scholarly papers discoverable via the World Wide Web (the Web), (2) is self- contained and explanatory with IP protection and, (3) is guaranteed to be disseminated widely on the Web. The prototype systems of the major workbench components have been developed. The quality of the material science ontology has been assessed, based on Gruber&#8217;s principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge&#8211;sharing, while its applicability has been evaluated through two of the workbench components, the ontology-based federated search interface and the provenance-aware scientific compound object publishing system. Those prototype systems have been deployed within a team of fuel cell scientists working within the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) at the University of Queensland. Following the user evaluation, the overall feedback to date has been very positive. First, the scientists were impressed with the convenience of the ontology-based federated search interface because of the easy and quick access to the integrated databases and analytical tools. Next, they felt the surge of the relief that the complex compound synthesis process could be managed by and monitored through the WSBPEL workflow management system. They were also excited because the system is able to systematically acquire huge amounts of complex experimental data produced by self-contained computational services that is no longer handled manually with paper-based laboratory notebooks. Finally, the scientific compound object publishing system inspired them to publish their data voluntarily, because it provides them with a scientific-friendly and intuitive interface that enables scientists to, (1) intuitively access experimental data and information, (2) author self-contained and explanatory scientific compound objects that incorporate experimental data and information about research outcomes, and published scholarly papers and peer-reviewed datasets to strengthen those outcomes, (3) enforce proper measures for IP protection, (4) comply those objects with the Open Archives Initiative Protocol &#8211; Object Exchange and Reuse (OAI-ORE) to maximize its dissemination over the Web and,(5) ingest those objects into a Fedora-based digital library.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web, web services, wsbpel, materials informatics, oai-ore, ontology, owl, swrl, data-driven approach, provenance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197643</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antennas for Modern Indoor Wireless Communication Systems</field><field name="creator">Serguei Zagriatski</field><field name="description">Recent years have witnessed a growing demand for broadband wireless communication services such as on-the-go web-browsing, high speed data transfer and streaming of high definition multimedia. In response to this growth, there has been a rapid progress in research and development of technologies supporting high-speed wireless networks offering flexibility and scalability to heterogeneous consumer requirements. A fundamental challenge to the reliable operation of a wireless communication link is the wireless channel which is influenced by time-variant noise, interference, multipath and scarcity of the available frequency spectrum. Due to the wireless nature of the signal transmission and the manner in which energy is distributed or collected, an antenna has a profound influence on an efficient operation of wireless link. Because nowadays an antenna is required to work with many wireless standards, it poses one of the most difficult design and development technological problems. In the past, many antenna designs were concentrated on conventional outdoor applications such as satellite communications, terrestrial point to point communications and cellular base stations. In these applications, the primary design goal was the antenna electrical performance. In case of indoor applications, the designer has to pay attention not only to the electrical performance but also to mechanical, environmental and aesthetic features of antenna. In this thesis, the investigations into design and development of antenna for indoor wireless communication systems that are either currently widespread or quickly entering the consumer market are carried out. First, a single band circularly polarized Radial Line Slot Array antenna covering 2.4GHz ISM frequency spectrum of IEEE 802.11b/g protocol is proposed. Then, an access point antenna for IEEE 802.11a/b/g WLAN applications operating in a dual frequency band covering 2.4GHz and 5.2GHz frequency spectra is described. It consists of a RLSA antenna and a patch antenna combined in one body. During the design stage, in addition to characteristics such as return loss, radiation pattern and polarization, attention is paid to mechanical rigidity, light weight and low visual impact of these radiating structures. A low manufacturing cost is also part of the design strategy. This is important because of competitive commercial market of WLAN applications which is sensitive to the development cost. In theoretical investigations, a Field Matching Method is utilized to achieve a first order approximation to the coaxial-to-waveguide transition forming the feeding element of the RLSA antenna. Next, the full EM analysis (HFSS&#8482;) based on Field Element Method is applied to simulate the single and dual band antennas. Both types of access point antennas are manufactured and tested. Experimental results are compared with simulation results. The next part of this thesis presents the investigations into antenna diversity techniques for a wireless communication link in an indoor environment. The design of the automated experimental testbed is presented. This testing facility is used to measure the signal strength levels of a communication link between a mobile wireless device and an access point when they are equipped with multiple element antennas (MEAs). Special attention is given to the benefits of using MEA in a rich scattering environment that is accompanied the experiment. Full design details including electrical and mechanical features are provided. For a given feeding configuration, the testbed allows for measuring the received signal strength when the receiving module is moved over a circular area in an indoor environment. First set of experiments concerns the MEA system that utilizes two single-port transceivers each equipped with either 180&#186; or 90&#186; 3dB hybrid. By using alternatively one of the two input ports of the hybrids to feed a pair of monopole antennas several different transmission or reception modes of the 2x2 MEA communication link are investigated. The next set of experiments focuses on the performances of an indoor wireless system which uses either linearly or circularly polarized antennas at the two sides of the communication link. The overall diversity results indicate that by marginally increasing an overall system complexity (by using simple hybrid circuits and antennas), traditional transceiver systems equipped with MEA can provide significant improvements in the quality of indoor wireless link. The final part of this thesis presents the investigations into the design of planar monopole antennas that offer good return loss and omni-directional radiation pattern characteristics over an Ultra Wide frequency Band (UWB) spanning from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. Two types of planar monopole antennas are investigated. First, the ring type square with semi-circular base monopole antenna placed vertically above a finite ground plane is introduced followed by its design, manufacturing and testing. The second UWB antenna which is proposed in this thesis is a printed square with semi-circular base monopole antenna. This antenna is positioned in the same plane as ground and thus offers direct integration with a front-end circuitry of wireless transceiver. Several variations of this type of antenna featuring different outlines are designed, manufactured and tested. The obtained experimental results show a good agreement with the simulation results, as accomplished with the full EM analysis and simulation software HFSS&#8482;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antenna</field><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">communications</field><field name="subject">rlsa</field><field name="subject">patch</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">testbed</field><field name="subject">uwb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198217</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRING THE BOMBS OUT OF THE BASEMENT: THE UNITED STATES, THE NPT,AND THE NUCLEAR NON-SIGNATORIES, 1961-1974</field><field name="creator">Eliza Matthews</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Since the dawn of the atomic age, the United States of America [US] saw the problem of nuclear proliferation as one of its own creation and therefore theirs to rectify. Perhaps motivated by a form of nuclear imperialism, the US held the majority of the aspiration and ability to solve the international problem of nuclear proliferation. In hindsight there is perhaps very little that successive presidential administrations could have done to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons during this period without significantly affecting their own international ambitions. However, the possibility that the US could have obtained the signatures of the nuclear non-signatories of India, Pakistan and Israel on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968) [NPT] became more remote due to the determination of those states to act independently and demonstrate their authority over their own nuclear matters in the shadow of both the superpowers during the Cold War. Furthermore, the American failure to obtain early agreement on the nuclear issue meant that the long-term nuclear ambitions of these nations could not be reversed. Exploiting an array of archival sources, Bring the Bombs out of the Basement analyses the process by which the US sought to bring these non-compliant states into the nuclear non-proliferation regime. It also discusses the significance of the failure of the US to bring the nuclear non-signatories into the fold. Studying the problem under the framework of the NPT as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation system, it focuses on the period between 1961 and 1974 &#8211; from the intensification of NPT negotiations under President John F. Kennedy, to the year in which India detonated its first nuclear device. By analysing the diplomatic interactions between the US and India, Pakistan and Israel, this thesis examines why the US was unable to politically tame one of the most significant scientific research achievements of all time and wield influence in the nuclear arena commensurate to its superpower status. In terms of uniqueness, this is the first study to have comprehensively examined and compared US nuclear policy towards only the nuclear non-signatories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">United States - foreign relations</field><field name="subject">nuclear weapons</field><field name="subject">non-proliferation</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="subject">Israel</field><field name="subject">South Asia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198989</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Concept-Driven Approach to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design</field><field name="creator">Ven Yu Sien</field><field name="description">The Unified Modelling Language (UML) and object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) have become essential topics in both academia and industry. UML is the accepted standard modelling language for describing object-oriented (OO) systems for analysis and design, and many UML CASE tools have been built and are used in academia and industry. OO technology and UML is an ongoing area of research, and many applications have been developed using OO technology. However, observations on current software development practices in some computer companies have shown that many OO software developers are not adopting recognised OOAD techniques. Both information technology (IT) students at higher educational institutions and professionals have in general found difficulty in grasping OO concepts, and the role that UML diagrams play in the design of the analysis and design solution. They particularly find difficulty in performing abstractions of real-world problems within the context of OOAD. They are unable to effectively build class diagrams from the problem domain because they essentially do not know &#8216;what&#8217; to model. They therefore prefer to start coding software applications before building the analysis and design artifacts. Most of these students invariably prefer to focus on the implementation phase of a software development lifecycle and consider the preceding analysis and design phases superfluous. The overall goal of this thesis is to contribute to a significant improvement in the way students and software developers analyse and design their OO systems. We present a new approach by introducing concept mapping as a tool to help novices in OOAD produce more appropriate UML class and sequence diagrams. The class and sequence diagrams are selected because they represent the essential static and behavioural aspects of a problem domain. The former is fundamental to the OO modelling process and the latter is one of the most widely used dynamic diagrams in UML. Concept mapping is a popular tool used in education for facilitating learning, comprehension and the development of knowledge. Within the context of OOAD, we propose to use concept maps as a graphical representation of fundamental concepts, and their relationships and responsibilities within a problem domain. A static concept map derived from expanded use cases (use case narratives) can subsequently evolve into a class diagram containing information on classes, attributes, associations and generalisation-specialisation hierarchies. A dynamic concept map derived from an expanded use case can evolve into a sequence diagram containing information on the interaction of objects (and their messages) to fulfil the responsibilities of a particular scenario of the use case. In this thesis, a study is initially conducted to investigate in detail the difficulties undergraduate students have when producing UML class and sequence diagrams. The results of the study reveal and confirm some of the fundamental problems that students have with OO modelling. In order to address these problems, a concept-driven approach is developed to help novices produce more appropriate UML class and sequence diagrams. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by three different experiments. The data from these experiments is analysed and there is sufficient statistical evidence to support the claim that the participants produce more appropriate class and sequence diagrams after being taught concept mapping techniques. As a result of this positive outcome, a set of guidelines is developed for teaching OO modelling with concept maps. These guidelines could be integrated into existing OOAD courses to help software engineering educators resolve some of the difficulties they face when teaching OOAD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">concept maps</field><field name="subject">object-orientation</field><field name="subject">UML</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">class diagram</field><field name="subject">sequence diagram</field><field name="subject">Experiment</field><field name="subject">OOAD education</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Snore Sound Pitch and Total Airway Response in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Detection</field><field name="creator">Asela S Karunajeewa</field><field name="description">Obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a highly prevalent disease in which upper airways are collapsed during sleep, leading to serious consequences. The reference standard of clinical diagnosis, called Polysomnography (PSG), requires a full-night hospital stay connected to over 15 measuring channels requiring physical contact with sensors. The vast quantity of physiological data acquired during the PSG has to be manually scored by a qualified technologist to assess the presence or absence of the decease. The PSG is inconvenient, time consuming, expensive and unsuited for community screening. The limited PSG facilities around the world have resulted in long waiting lists and a large fraction of patients remain undiagnosed at present. There has been a flurry of recent activities in developing a portable technology to resolve this need. All the devices have at least one sensor that requires physical contact with the subject. Unattended systems have not led to sufficiently high sensitivity/specificity levels to be used in a routine home monitoring or a community screening exercise. OSAHS is a sleep respiratory disorder principally caused by functional deficiencies occurring in the upper airways during sleep. These conditions and the reduced muscle tone during sleep, cause the muscles in the upper airways to collapse partially or completely thus resulting in episodes of hypopnoea and apnoea respectively. During the process leading to collapse of upper airways, upper airways act as an acoustic filter frequently producing snoring sounds. The process of snore sound production leads us to hypothesise that snore sounds should contain information on changes occurring in the upper airways during the OSAHS. Snoring almost always accompanies the OSAHS and is universally recognised as its earliest symptom. At present, however, the quantitative analysis of snore sounds is not a practice in clinical OSAHS detection. The vast potential of snoring in the diagnosis/screening of the OSAHS remains unused. Snoring-based technology opens up opportunities for building community-screening devices that do not depend on contact instrumentation. In this thesis, we present our work towards developing a snore&#8211;based non-contact instrumentation for the diagnosis/screening of the OSAHS. The primary task in the analysis of Snore Related Sounds (SRS) would be to segment the SRS data as accurately as possible into three main classes, snoring (voiced non-silence), breathing (unvoiced non-silence) and silence. A new algorithm was developed, based on pattern recognition for the SRS segmentation. Four features derived from the SRS were considered to classify samples of the SRS into three classes. We also investigated the performance of the algorithm with three commonly-used noise reduction (NR) techniques in speech processing, Amplitude Spectral Subtraction (ASS), Power Spectral Subtraction (PSS) and Short Time Spectral Amplitude (STSA) Estimation. It was found that the noise reduction, together with a proper choice of features, could improve the classification accuracy to 96.78%. A novel model for the SRS was proposed for the response of a mixed-phase system (total airways response, TAR) to a source excitation at the input. The TAR/source model is similar to the vocal tract/source model in speech synthesis and is capable of capturing the acoustical changes brought about by the collapsing upper airways in the OSAHS. An algorithm was developed, based on the higher-order-spectra (HOS) to jointly estimate the source and the TAR, preserving the true phase characteristics of the latter. Working on a clinical database of signals, we show that the TAR is indeed a mixed phased signal and second-order statistics cannot fully characterise it. Nocturnal speech sounds can corrupt snore recordings and pose a challenge to the snore-based OSAHS diagnosis. The TAR could be shown to detect speech segments embedded in snores and derive features to diagnose the OSAHS. Finally presented is a novel technique for diagnosing the OSAHS, based solely on multi-parametric snore sound analysis. The method comprises a logistic regression model fed with a range of snore parameters derived from its features &#8212; the pitch and Total Airways Response (TAR) estimated using a Higher Order Statistics (HOS) based algorithm. The model was developed and its performance validated on a clinical database consisting of overnight snoring sounds simultaneously recorded during a hospital PSG using a high fidelity sound recording setup. The K-fold cross validation technique was used for validating the model. The validation process achieved an 89.3% sensitivity with 92.3% specificity (the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96) in classifying the data sets into the two groups, the OSAHS (AHI &gt;10) and the non-OSAHS. These results are superior to the existing results and unequivocally illustrate the feasibility of developing a snore-based non-contact OSAHS screening device.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">10 Technology</field><field name="subject">Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome, Snore-related Sounds, Class Classification, Higher-order Statistics, Total Airways Response, Pitch, Multi-parametric, Logistic Regression Model, Community Screening</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200592</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anti-pronation tape: Initial effects on neuromotor control of gait, foot posture and foot mobility and the influence of continual use</field><field name="creator">Melinda Franettovich</field><field name="description">Anti-pronation taping is commonly used by clinicians in the management of lower limb musculoskeletal pain and injury. Despite its frequent use in the clinical setting the mechanism(s) underlying its efficacy is not completely understood. For example, there is evidence that anti-pronation taping produces a biomechanical effect, but there has been little investigation of other mechanisms such as neurophysiological or psychological effects. Additionally, studies to date have been performed in mostly asymptomatic populations and have focused on the initial effect of tape (i.e. immediately following application and through a short duration of activity). Improved understanding of the underlying physiological mechanism(s) of anti-pronation tape is likely to facilitate improved knowledge of the technique, which may optimise its clinical application and contribute to clinical selection guidelines. The aims of this thesis were developed to address several of the limitations in the current anti-pronation taping literature. To facilitate an investigation of the comparative initial physiological effect of anti-pronation tape in a symptomatic and asymptomatic population, the first aim of this thesis was to compare neuromotor control (control of muscle activation and movement patterns) of gait, foot posture and foot mobility between asymptomatic individuals and individuals with a history of exercise related leg pain. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate the initial physiological effects of anti-pronation tape, specifically its neurophysiological (i.e. effect on muscle activation patterns) and biomechanical (i.e. effect on movement patterns, foot posture, foot mobility) effects. Thirdly this thesis aimed to investigate the duration of these initial physiological effects following tape removal. The fourth and fifth aims were to investigate the long term biomechanical and neurophysiological effects of anti-pronation taping i.e. following continual use over a clinically relevant period. In the first instance our aim was to investigate the effect of continual use on neuromotor control of gait, foot posture and foot mobility, and secondly to investigate the effect of continual use on the technique&#8217;s initial neurophysiological and biomechanical effects. Individuals with exercise related leg pain demonstrated lower activation of gluteus medius and lateral gastrocnemius during gait, but we observed no differences in lower limb movement patterns or foot posture and foot mobility between the two groups. The initial effect of tape was similar in individuals with and without exercise related leg pain. Specifically application of tape produced a reduction in activation of tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius, and increased activation of peroneus longus. There was a reduction in foot mobility, ankle plantarflexion and abduction excursion and an increase in ankle dorsiflexion and adduction excursion. Reduced muscle activation and increased motion was also observed at more proximal segments (knee, hip, pelvis), but were of smaller magnitude than at the foot and ankle. Changes in foot mobility, ankle kinematics and leg muscle activity did not continue following the removal of tape, but at more proximal segments (i.e. pelvis, hip and knee) small changes in kinematics and muscle activity were observed following the removal of tape. In regards to long term effects, continual use of tape for approximately 12 days produced a small increase in arch height when compared to a control. We did not observe a change in muscle activation or motion patterns, nor did continual use of the technique influence its initial neurophysiological or biomechanical effects (i.e. reduction in muscle activity, reduction in foot mobility, altered lower limb motion). The studies from this thesis provide evidence that anti-pronation tape should be considered in the management of individuals where reduced midfoot mobility, control of ankle motion or reduced activation of the leg muscles is desired, regardless of symptomatic status. When applied for approximately 12 days, anti-pronation tape produced a small increase in arch height ratio, but no alteration in neuromotor control. We are not aware of any definitive data on what constitutes a clinically meaningful increase in arch height, but results from a published case series suggests that our findings of a small increase in arch height may be clinically relevant for the treatment of lower extremity overuse injuries. Continual use of tape for a clinically relevant period does not alter its initial effects on foot posture and mobility or neuromotor control during gait. It would appear that the initial effects of anti-pronation tape are robust even after continuous use over a period of 11 days.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lower Limb</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Gait analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200607</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Impact of Note Taking on the Quality of Mock Jurors&#8217; Decisions</field><field name="creator">Tanya Strub</field><field name="description">Abstract This research investigated the extent to which taking notes influenced the quality of mock jurors&#8217; decisions. High quality decisions were defined in this research as those which did not reflect the influence of the offender stereotype. The impact of note taking on the quality of jurors&#8217; decisions is central to the judicial community&#8217;s concerns about note taking as a jury aid and their willingness to offer it in trial contexts. Previous research has argued that note takers make better quality decisions than non-note takers because note takers recall more trial content and make judgements that better reflect the evidence presented. However, according to dual process models of persuasion, high quality decisions should show evidence of both effortful processing of information and no influence of peripheral cues, such as stereotypes. To date, the existing literature has neglected to consider the extent to which note takers, as compared to non-note takers, are influenced by peripheral cues. The current research sought to address this by investigating the extent to which note taking and non-note taking mock jurors were influenced by stereotypes when making decisions in a mock criminal trial. In particular, note taking and non-note taking mock jurors were presented with a criminal trial in which either a male or female defendant had been charged with a stereotypically masculine crime (e.g., aggravated robbery or murder). The extent to which mock jurors were more likely to convict the male defendant and acquit the female defendant was used as a marker of the extent that stereotypes about offenders influenced participants in these studies. Across studies, note takers&#8217; perceptions of guilt, evaluation of the defendant, and, in some instances, recall of trial content, reflected stereotype-based processing while the corresponding measures for non-note takers did not. This research then went on to investigate why note takers were more vulnerable to the influence of stereotypes than non-note takers. It was proposed that one reason might be the requirement that note takers simultaneously record and evaluate trial content. Previous research has shown that persons engaged in dual tasks rely on stereotypes to increase information processing efficiency and are therefore able to re-direct cognitive resources to the additional task. Consistent with previous studies, the current research found that both note takers and mock jurors engaged in an additional task during the trial were more vulnerable to the influence of stereotypes than non-note takers. Furthermore, whilst investigating interventions designed to reduce the influence of stereotypes on note takers&#8217; decisions, results revealed that such interventions were less successful in improving decision quality than interventions that removed the requirement to engage in dual tasks. In particular, the influence of stereotypes was reduced when note takers were encouraged to elaborate on the content of their notes during designated review periods. Whilst methodological features of this research program--namely a reliance on student samples and the relative brevity of mock trials used--may have led to an underestimation of the reliance on stereotypes for note takers, the research has implications for the instructions given to jurors about note taking in judicial contexts. Specifically, the central conclusion of the thesis is that it would seem prudent to amend instructions to direct note takers to engage in the effortful review of their notes prior to coming together to reach a verdict.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">note taking and review</field><field name="subject">dual process models of persuasion</field><field name="subject">juror</field><field name="subject">Dual Task</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201715</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Defining Sets in Latin Squares and two Intersection Problems, one for Latin Squares and one for Steiner Triple Systems</field><field name="creator">Thomas Mccourt</field><field name="description">Consider distinct latin squares, L and M, of order n. Then the pair (T1, T2) where T1 = L \M and T2 = M \ L is called a latin bitrade. Furthermore T1 and T2 are referred to as latin trades, in which T2 is said to be a disjoint mate of T1 (and vice versa). Dr&#225;pal (1991) showed that, under certain conditions, a partition of an equilateral triangle of side length n, where n is some integer, into smaller, integer length sided equilateral triangles gives rise to a latin trade within the latin square based on the addition table for the integers modulo n. A partial latin square P of order n is said to be completable if there exists a latin square L of order n such that P &#8838; L. If there is only one such possible latin square, L, of order n then P is said to be uniquely completable and P is called a defining set of L. Furthermore, if C is a uniquely completable partial latin square such that no proper subset of C is uniquely completable, C is said to be a critical set or a minimal defining set. These concepts, namely latin trades and defining sets in latin squares, are intimately connected by the following observation. If L is a latin square and D &#8838; L is a defining set, then D intersects all latin bitrades for which one mate is contained in L. In Part I of this thesis Dr&#180;apal&#8217;s result is applied to investigate the structure of certain defining sets in latin squares. The results that are obtained are interesting in themselves; furthermore, the geometric approach to the problem yields additional appealing results. These geometric results are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6. They pertain to partitioning regions (polygons in R2 that satisfy certain obvious conditions) into equilateral, integer length sided, triangles, such that no point, in the region, is a corner of more than three distinct triangles. In Chapter 2 one of the main two theorems on defining sets is established, as is a method for using the above geometric results to prove the nonexistence of certain types of defining sets. In Part II of this thesis, intersection problems, for latin squares and Steiner triple systems, are considered. The seminal works, for problems of these types, are due to Lindner and Rosa (1975) and Fu (1980). A natural progression, from the established literature, for intersection problems between elements in a pair of latin squares or Steiner triple systems is to problems in which the intersection is composed of a number of disjoint configurations (isomorphic copies of some specified partial triple system). In this thesis solutions to two intersection problems for disjoint configurations are detailed. An m-flower, (F,F), is a partial triple system/configuration, such that: F = {{x, yi, zi} | {yi, zi} &#8745; {yj , zj} = &#8709;, for 0 &#8804; i, j &#8804; m &#8722; 1, i 6= j}; and F = UX&#8712;FX. The first such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k and m &#8805; 2 such that a pair of latin squares of order n exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint m-flowers. The necessary terminology, constructions, lemmas and proof for this result are contained in Chapters 7, 8 and 9. The second such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k such that a pair of Steiner triple systems of order u exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint 2-flowers. This result relies on the solution to the latin square problem and an additional result from Chapter 9. The further constructions and lemmas used to prove this result are detailed in Chapter 10.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">latin trade</field><field name="subject">latin bitrade</field><field name="subject">triangulation</field><field name="subject">defining set</field><field name="subject">critical set</field><field name="subject">partial triple system</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple system</field><field name="subject">intersection problem</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsive Workflows: Design, Execution and Analysis of Interruption Policy Models</field><field name="creator">Belinda Melanie Carter</field><field name="description">Business processes form the backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation can be achieved by encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 'responsive' workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 'order to cash' process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 'interruptions'. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 'expected, asynchronous exceptions' during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping charge or refund may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 'exception handling' rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 'basic' and 'extended' interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workflow systems</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">business processes</field><field name="subject">expression evaluation</field><field name="subject">rules</field><field name="subject">specification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202127</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Needs-based and needs-focused care: Understanding the needs of children and young people in care in Australia through the documentary analysis of multiple stakeholder perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stewart Redshaw</field><field name="description">Over the last decade out-of-home care in Australia has experienced a period of considerable turmoil as royal commissions, parliamentary inquiries, departmental audits, empirical research and industry reports have highlighted the dire straits of the care system. A constant theme throughout has been the failure of the sector to adequately meet the needs of children and young people in care. Within this context the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of children and young people in care in Australia, giving voice to the full range of stakeholders, whose views were expressed in multiple documentary types. Specifically, the aim was to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs and formulate this into a formal taxonomy of needs. Using document analysis and the constant comparative method within the constructivist paradigm of social inquiry, the study involved analysis of 580 non-traditional, naturalistic and secondary documents relating to out-of-home care in Australia. The document sample consisted of five data types: primary data (letters, submissions to inquiries, transcripts of interviews and public hearings, and personal accounts); secondary data (reports resulting from commissions of inquiries and departmental reviews, audits and investigations); empirical data (the published findings from empirical research); legislative and policy data (legislation, regulation and quality frameworks); and industry and practitioner data (reports by academics, peak bodies and advocacy groups, and writings by out-of-home care practitioners). Further, the document sample included stakeholders from five major groups: children and young people in care (and former wards ); their parents and extended family; carers, agency staff and practitioners; statutory workers; and academics, advocates, and representatives of state and national peak bodies. The findings include a series of prominent themes of care; salient findings that highlight the experiences and needs of children and young people in care; and the taxonomy of needs. The prominent themes include the importance of natural family connectedness, cultural identity and connectedness, and counselling and therapeutic support. Issues relating to placement stability and disruption, safety and protection and, transition from care also featured prominently. The salient findings include an exploration of the overwhelming emotions of care, emotional putdowns, vicarious trauma and the witnessing of violence and abuse in out-of-home care, characteristics of children and young people who survive and thrive in care and beyond, characteristics of quality carers, symptom intolerance, disenfranchised grief &#8211; the never-ending story, and the defensive behaviours of children and young people in care. The taxonomy of needs provides a comprehensive overview of the needs of children and young people in care across 89 attributes and 21 attribute sub-categories, within 21 dimensions, and across three domains (the personal, placement, and community-of-care domains). The dimensions in the personal domain include attachment, physical development and health, personal growth, education and vocational attainment, development of the inner-self, and hope in life and for the future. The placement domain includes basic needs, basic entitlements, caring relationships, positive-parenting-practices, activity programming, focused-support, peer-relations and positive group management, and preparation for and transition from care. The community-of-care domain includes clinical intervention, family connectedness and involvement in placement, friends and social outlets, significant others, cultural-religious-spiritual connectedness, departmental worker capacity and support, and after care support. The principal theoretical, practice, and methodological conclusions derived from this study are that children and young people in care in Australia have considerable needs, are largely unable to meet their own needs, and experience harm when their needs are not met. Consequently, the out-of-home care sector has an inescapable obligation to provide for these needs if children and young people in care are to avoid harm and experience personal wellbeing. Further, children and young people in care have experienced considerable need deprivation, and if their needs are not to be forgotten, then a shift to a &#8216;needs-based&#8217;, &#8216;needs-focused&#8217; paradigm of care is needed to inform out-of-home care policy, service design, and day-to-day practice. And finally, document analysis using non-traditional, naturalistic, and secondary data (representing the full range of stakeholder perspectives) within a constructivist paradigm of inquiry, provides an effective, indeed powerful methodology for exploring the needs of children and young people in care, and for giving voice to the many stakeholders who voices may never have been heard again.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Needs</field><field name="subject">Out-of-home care</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Quality care</field><field name="subject">Document analysis</field><field name="subject">Constant comparative method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202777</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic Models for the Analysis of Quantitative Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="creator">Denis Bauer</field><field name="description">Understanding transcriptional regulation quantitatively is a crucial step towards uncovering and ultimately utilizing the regulatory semantics encoded in the genome. Transcription of a gene is induced by the binding of site-specific transcription factors (TFs) to so-called cis-regulatory-modules (CRMs). The frequency and duration of the binding events are influenced by the concentrations of the TFs, the binding affinities and location of the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the CRM as well as the properties of the TFs themselves (e.g. effectiveness, competitive interaction with other TFs). Modeling these interactions using a mathematical approach, based on sound biochemical and thermodynamic foundations, enables the understanding and quantitative prediction of transcriptional output of a target gene. In the thesis I introduce the developed framework for modeling, visualizing, and predicting the regulation of the transcription rate of a target gene. Given the concentrations of a set of TFs, the TFBSs in a regulatory DNA region, and the transcription rate of the target gene, the method will optimize its parameters to generate a predictive model that incorporates the regulatory mechanism of the observed gene. I demonstrate the generalization ability of the model by subjecting it to standard machine learning and hypothesis testing procedures. Furthermore, I demonstrate the potential of the approach by training the method on a gene in D. melanogaster and predicting the output of the homologous genes in 12 other Drosophila species where the regulatory sequence has evolved substantially but the regulatory mechanism was conserved. Finally, I investigate the proposed role-switching behaviour of TFs regulating the development of D. melanogaster, which suggests that SUMOylation is the biological mechanism facilitating the switch.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="subject">Gene Regulation</field><field name="subject">Transcription Factor</field><field name="subject">Thermodynamic modeling</field><field name="subject">Optimization Problems</field><field name="subject">Comparative Genomics</field><field name="subject">Evolution and phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">SUMOylation</field><field name="subject">D. melanogaster</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203909</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnographic study of the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Cameron Parsell</field><field name="description">Abstract People who are homeless are portrayed to be a distinct type of &#8216;homeless person&#8217;. Within scholarly research literature, their state of homelessness has been presented as informative of who they are. On both an individual and collective level, people without homes are ascribed with identities on the basis of their homelessness. Their voices and perspectives rarely contribute to broader knowledge about who they are as people. As such, the imposed &#8216;homeless identity&#8217; has the consequence of positioning them as &#8216;other&#8217; than the &#8216;normal&#8217; people with homes. Using an ethnographic approach, this study aims to understand the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless. Approximately one hundred people who slept and interacted within inner suburban Brisbane&#8217;s public places participated in this research. To learn about how they lived and who they saw themselves as individuals, I observed them, socialised with them, engaged them in informal conversations and formal interviews. This approach to fieldwork, conducted over a six month period, provided me with the opportunity to witness diverse aspects of daily lives. Further, the ethnographic engagement enabled a consideration of the ways people enacted and displayed different aspects of their identities across different social and physical places. For the individuals who participated in this study, there was a stark distinction between how they lived, on the one hand, and the type of people they identified themselves as, on the other. They were comfortable describing their lives in ways that deviated from what they saw as the &#8216;mainstream&#8217;, but at the same time, they aligned themselves with this &#8216;mainstream&#8217;. Research participants expressed a strong view that their experiences of homelessness did not offer any purchase in explaining who they were, and how they thought about the world. The public places in which they lived were perceived as problematic. Public places were dangerous and the site of unwanted interactions. Although living in public places meant that interactions and friendships with other people who were homeless was a reality, these interactions did not constitute a &#8216;homeless collective&#8217;. More fundamentally, however, living in public places meant having no legitimate places, and having limited capacity to control day-to-day lives. The participants in this research articulated stereotypical notions of what home meant to them &#8211; home was a physical structure, a house. Similarly, home was a solution to their lives as homeless. Their constructions of home can also be seen as symbolic of their aspirations to find their &#8216;place&#8217;, and engage in the &#8216;mainstream&#8217; society they feel disconnected from. While public places were associated with limited control over daily lives, the people in this research also exercised agency in enacting different aspects of their identities. Mediated by the social and physical constraints within their environment, they displayed an awareness of social expectations and emphasised elements of the self to achieve specific ends. Identities matter. An understanding of the identities of people experiencing homelessness, from their perspectives, can contribute toward the development of homelessness practice and policy responses. A distinction is made between solving problems people may have and solving homelessness. In terms of the latter, the thesis concludes that the provision of &#8216;normal&#8217; housing and the availability of support, as distinct from mandatory engagement with case management, is the most appropriate response to the needs of the people who participated in this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">homeless people</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">public places</field><field name="subject">home</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204070</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-interpreting Modern Chinese Art: An Analysis of Three Women Artists In Twentieth-Century China (Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen)</field><field name="creator">Hwee Leng Teo</field><field name="description">There have been only sporadic attempts to highlight Chinese women&#8217;s role and influence in art, even though their contribution has been major. This thesis seeks to understand the significance of women&#8217;s participation in modern Chinese art history through the narratives and works of Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen, who were professionally active at different political stages of twentieth-century China. Using an interdisciplinary framework, drawing on concepts from theories such as modernism, feminism and postcolonialism, this thesis analyzes a culturally specific field in art history and the interrelationship between various factors that have contributed to it. As artists of a peripheral culture, various factors in the artistic production of Chinese women have been overlooked and often misinterpreted. This thesis argues that the three artists in this study have produced different, individualized responses to the Euro-American model of modernism. To highlight the cultural specificity of China, the introductory chapter will include a short comparative analysis between Chinese modernism and the modernisms of other Asian countries. The adoption of Western art forms by early overseas-trained Chinese artists such as Pan indicates as many intricacies and ambivalences as in the complex relationship of China with Western imperialism. Chapter Two situates the Westernized works of Pan in the context of Chinese modernism, pre-feminism and the semi-colonized state of early twentieth-century China. In relation to the theories of orientalism and provincialism, implications of the ambiguities of Pan&#8217;s representations are extended to debates that explore the subjectivity and identity of non-European artists in their quest for modernism. Nie Ou was born into the era when the Chinese Communists had just taken over in 1949. Under the autocratic rule of the Communists, Nie was exiled to the northern countryside during her early adulthood as part of the &#8220;re-educating the elite&#8221; program. Chapter Three demonstrates how Nie successfully emerged from the repercussions of the Cultural Revolution. During this period of intensified Chinese nationalism, Nie found ways to merge the influences of the restrictive style of Socialist Realism and the poetic Chinese literati painting tradition to create an individualized style of representation. China underwent rapid modernization in the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter Four examines the works of contemporary artist Yin Xiuzhen who, with her avant-garde installations, has pushed the boundaries of what constitutes conventional Chinese art. This chapter analyzes Yin&#8217;s works in the context of late twentieth-century China, where the nation was no longer a Socialist monolith but a complex amalgam in which old and new, Socialist and capitalist, modern and postmodern co-existed. Yin&#8217;s works will be studied in relation to theories of postmodernism, postfeminism and globalism. Chapter Five consolidates the earlier chapters by reflecting on how various conditions throughout the twentieth century have changed and shaped the role of women in Chinese art history. The concluding chapter will consider the influence Chinese women artists may have on the art discourse in China today, and perhaps across other cultures. This chapter will explore the constraints upon them and the potential of their future role, not only in China but also in the broader sense of what it means to be an artist internationally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Chinese culture, Chinese women artists, feminism, postcolonialism, modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male Risk Taking as a Sexual Display Strategy: Proximal and Distal Explanations for Young Men's Risk Taking</field><field name="creator">Richard Ronay</field><field name="description">This research explores whether male risk taking emerges as a sexual display strategy in the presence of attractive women. Experiments 1 to 3 explored whether young males reported and engaged in more risk taking after viewing pictures of highly attractive females. Possible self-control mechanisms were investigated via working memory, reversal learning, and Stroop tasks. In addition, second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) was measured as a proxy for individual differences in testosterone. Viewing pictures of highly attractive females led to greater self-reported risk-taking. 2D:4D was found to moderate the effect on risk-taking behaviours, with increases for high, but decreases for low testosterone males. Digit ratio also moderated the effects observed on the Stroop and reversal learning tasks. Experiments 4 and 5 extended these findings to examine how power interacts with testosterone to influence risk taking and inhibitory control. As testosterone is as-sociated with the pursuit of power and status (Dabbs &amp; Dabbs, 2000), high testoster-one individuals primed with power were expected to have little reason to disrupt the status quo and thus should be risk-avoidant. Conversely, high-testosterone individuals primed with low power were expected to use risk taking as a vehicle for pursuing po-tential gains to their status and resources. The findings from two experiments are con-sistent with these predictions. In Experiment 1, higher testosterone males (as indicated by second&#8211;fourth digit ratio) showed greater risk-taking when primed with low power. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and also showed that when primed with high power, higher testosterone males took fewer risks. The influence of power on Stroop performance was also moderated by individual differences in testosterone. Par-ticipants primed with high power showed better Stroop performance if they were lower in testosterone, whereas participants primed with low power showed better Stroop performance if they were higher in testosterone. These results suggest that greater executive control accompanies but does not underlie enhanced risk taking, caused by testosterone and power. Finally, results from a field experiment (Experiment 6) with skateboarders demon-strate that physical risk taking by young male skateboarders increases in the presence of an attractive female. This increased risk taking led to more successes but also more crash landings in front of the female observer. Mediational analyses suggest that this increase in risk taking is caused in part by elevated testosterone levels of men who performed in front of the attractive female. In addition, skateboarders&#8217; risk taking was predicted by their performance on a reversal-learning task, reversal-learning perform-ance was disrupted by the presence of the attractive female, and the female&#8217;s presence moderated the observed relationship between risk taking and reversal learning. These results suggest that men use physical risk taking as a sexual display strategy, and they provide suggestive evidence regarding possible hormonal and neural mechanisms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">risk taking, testosterone, 2D:4D, executive control, sexual competition, power</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activated CMRF-56 Immunoselected Cells: A Potential Anti-Myeloma Vaccine</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Hsu</field><field name="description">The Mater Medical Research Institute proposes to undertake a Phase I clinical trial using CMRF-56 immunoselected blood dendritic cells (BDC) loaded with control and myeloma-associated tumour peptide antigens for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients with minimal residual disease. This thesis describes some of the fundamental pre-clinical in vitro experiments undertaken in preparation for this trial so as to maximise the potential of this vaccine to induce myeloma-specific immune responses. These experiments involved determining the parameters for optimal activation of the CMRF-56 immunoselected cell preparation and exploring the potential of novel myeloma peptide antigens to induce anti-myeloma cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. CMRF-56 immunoselected cell preparations, containing predominately myeloid BDC, monocytes and B cells, were prepared from both healthy donors and myeloma patients. Activation of this preparation with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was found to increase co-stimulatory molecule expression by and survival of BDC, improve peptide- and lysate-specific CTL induction, and, in combination with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), improve chemokine-specific migration of BDC. Following optimisation of in vitro CTL generation protocols, GM-CSF activated CMRF-56 immunoselected cells were examined for their ability to induce myeloma-specific immunity. Using lysate from myeloma cell line U266 as an antigen source, a polyclonal T cell pool was generated within which peptide specific CTL recognising myeloma antigens Muc1, HM1.24/BST2, DKK-1 and CT-7/MAGE-C1 could be identified. Furthermore, GM-CSF activated CMRF-56 immunoselected cells pulsed with HLA-A*201 restricted peptides derived from Muc1, HM1.24/BST2 and CT-7/MAGE-C1 could induce CTL capable of lysing both peptide- and myeloma cell line targets in both healthy donors and myeloma patients. These results provide the first evidence of immunogenic HLA-A*201 restricted epitopes of novel myeloma antigen CT-7/MAGE-C1. The data collected in this study supports the application of GM-CSF activated CMRF-56 immunoselected cells loaded with defined myeloma peptide antigens for the therapeutic vaccination of MM patients with minimal residual disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Dendritic Cell</field><field name="subject">Immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">Cytotoxic T Cell</field><field name="subject">Multiple Myeloma</field><field name="subject">tumour antigen</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204556</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fat soluble vitamins and function in adults awaiting liver transplantation.</field><field name="creator">Abbott-Johnson, Winsome</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the structure-property relationships in eumelanin</field><field name="creator">Jacques Bothma</field><field name="description">In this thesis we examine key structure-property relationships associated with eumelanin's photophysical properties. This has involved characterizing both the molecular and supramolecular structure of eumelanin, and examining how these relate to eumalanin's key optical properties that are relevant to their their role in the biosphere as photoprotectants. Using low-voltage high resolution transmission electron microscopy we definitively show that sheets of proto-molecules stack to form nanostructures. The inter-sheet spacings within these structures are between 3.7 and 4.0 &#197; consistent with non-covalent pie-pie stacking in heteroaromatic systems. Stacking interactions in similarly structured aromatic macromolecules play an important role in non-radiative energy dissipation and we propose that this may also be the case in the eumelanin system. We also examine the recently proposed hypothesis that excited state intramolecular proton transfer may play a role in the photophysics of 5,6-dihydoxyindole carboxylic acid, a key eumelanin monomer. The experimental results acquired in this study indicate that this hypothesis needs to be carefully re-examined and its justification would require more extensive experimental support. Key optical properties of 5,6-dihydoxyindole carboxylic acid are re-evaluated in an inert aprotic solvent and these have provided some insight into the electronic structure as well as the rates of radiative and non-radiative decay in this important eumelanin monomer. We go on to show how the structure of eumelanin can be manipulated to produce eumelanin thin films. These films display electrical conductivities comparable with amorphous silicon, as well as a host of other interesting and potentially useful optoelectronic properties. The results show great promise for eumelanin-based applications such as chemi-sensors (in a variety of architectures including organic field effect transistors with chemi-sensitive channels) and bolometric photon detectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">eumelanin, spectroscopy, thin films</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204804</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation, transportation and engineering of entanglement between two separate qubit systems</field><field name="creator">Sze-liang Chan</field><field name="description">Quantum entanglement is widely renounced as one of the most fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.

In this thesis, we address a number of problems associated with creating, transferring and engineering of entanglement between two separate parties. The work is motivated by a desire to better understand the dynamics of entanglement between systems. In particular, the research is mainly focused on the study of the dynamics of the well known maximally entangled Bell state under different in&#64258;uences such as decoherence and inter-qubit coupling. We show the connection between coherence and entanglement using the system sub jected to decoherence. We also con&#64257;rm the transfer of entanglement between completely isolated partite using the double Jaynes-Cummings model. Based on this result, we propose a new conservation criterion proven to be general for single excitation systems. Such conservation criterion are then compared and extended to a general N qubit systems. In addition, an attempt is made to evaluate entanglement conservation rules for the EPR- like multipartite entanglement.

The first phase of the research, comprising three pilot tests, and Study 1, Study 2a and 2b investigated how anti-norm leaders were judged by ingroup members, and two possible moderators of this effect. Study 1 aimed to replicate the basic findings of Abrams et al. (2008) and explore whether group members&#8217; evaluations of normative and deviant leaders would be moderated by the leaders&#8217; method of gaining leadership (appointed vs. elected). Study 2a and 2b examined whether group members&#8217; evaluations of normative and anti-norm leaders were moderated by the relationship of the ingroup to the authority who appointed the leader. The second phase of the research, comprising three pilot tests and Studies 3, 4 and 5, moved to consider what could help anti-norm leaders gain positive evaluations from members of their group in an organisational context. Drawing on the group engagement model (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003), the traditional leadership literature (Hollander, 1958; Hollander &amp; Julian, 1970), and relevant literature from the social identity approach (Hornsey, 2005; Morton, Postmes, &amp; Jetten, 2007) the second phase aimed to examine whether perceived respect from the leader could help the anti-norm leader to gain more positive evaluations from their group members. Study 3 replicated the design of Studies 2a and 2b in a pseudo-organisational scenario with perceived respect from the leader as an additional measured variable. Study 4 explored the impact of the informal quality of treatment (IQT) received by the ingroup members from the leader on perceptions of the anti-norm leader. In addition, the proposed mediating effect of perceived respect from the leader was examined. Study 5 examined whether respect for the group&#8217;s history by the leader would diminish the negative responses of group members to an anti-norm leader. Across the six pilot studies and six main studies, and consistent with the SGD model (Abrams et al., 2005; Abrams et al., 2008), normative leaders were consistently endorsed more, or evaluated more positively, than anti-norm leaders. Across the different testing contexts, incumbent anti-norm leaders were derogated regardless whether they were appointed or elected or whether the outgroup who appointed them had an incompatible or irrelevant relationship with the ingroup. Further, whilst showing high IQT to group members helped anti-norm leaders obtain similar evaluations as to those obtained by low IQT normative leaders, exhibiting high levels of respect for group history failed to help anti-norm leaders mitigate negative evaluations from their group members. These findings suggest that, in line Abrams et al. (2008), once an individual becomes a leader, group members do not take into consideration how that leader came to be or where they came from in evaluations. Instead, group members seem to focus on what the leader does, or can do, for the group. Whilst respect at the group, and particularly at the individual, level can have a limited impact on evaluations, it would seem that little that the leader can do on their own will moderate the negative evaluations of them that stem from the fact that their position fundamentally undermines the validity of prescriptive ingroup norms. As such, and consistent with SGD literature (Abrams et al., 2005; Abrams et al., 2008), the findings of the current program of research demonstrate the overwhelmingly robust motivation of group members to derogate anti-norm leaders who undermine prescriptive ingroup norms. For leaders faced with the challenging task of leading their ingroup towards the prescriptive norms of an outgroup, the findings of the current program of research suggest that, consistent with the group engagement model (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003) bolstering respect for group members through enacting both informal and formal procedures may be somewhat effective. Alternatively, and to carry the black sheep analogy dominant in this line of research further, the anti-norm leader may simply constitute the proverbial &#8216;sacrificial lamb&#8217; &#8211; that is rejected and unpopular among the people he or she is supposed to lead.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Subjective group dynamics</field><field name="subject">organisational justice</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205159</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of learning support as revealed through the practice of six exemplary Support teachers (learning difficulties) based in Queensland state primary schools</field><field name="creator">Michael Boyle</field><field name="description">Support teachers learning difficulties (STLD) have made a significant contribution to the provision of support for students experiencing learning difficulties and learning disabilities in Queensland state primary schools over almost forty years.

In keeping with this intent, a process of selecting the participants for in-depth study was instigated in a professional community of state primary STLD teachers located in a Brisbane education district to determine at the grass-roots what an exemplary STLD teacher might &#8220;look like&#8221;, and which six teachers in that community might contribute to the community&#8223;s understanding of exemplary STLD teaching practice. These contributions are represented in six case studies, referred to as &#8220;portraits&#8221; and were co-constructed, that is through a dialogic process between the participant and me. Each portrait communicates an aspect of teaching practice and the experiential knowledge that underpins it. The term &#8220;exemplary&#8221; has been adopted consciously to denote &#8220;that serves as an example&#8221; (Harper, 2001) in contrast to the term &#8220;expert&#8221;, which frequently carries a technical connotation. A mixed methodology was adopted (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 2003) in this qualitative study in anticipation of the need to draw upon various methods that in combination might assist in viewing, conceptualizing and harnessing the dynamic complexity expected to be evident in grassroots practice. First, various expressions of constructivism contributed, with the major influence being social constructivism to denote a &#8220;house&#8221; or a community of professionals in ongoing dialogue. 6 This provides the framework within which the study has been undertaken. Second, phenomenology, most particularly the work of Moustakas (1994) and van Manen (1990, 1994, 1995, 2007), is the primary source for the inspiration (van Manen) and the methods and tools (Moustakas) to explore the nature of their practice. Phenomenological approaches were adopted with the expectation they could assist in highlighting the essence of each individual&#8223;s practice while allowing for the eliciting of experiential themes that are of importance to the professional community of STLD teachers. Finally, studies of practical teacher knowledge (Elbaz, 1983) in association with narrative inquiry (Connolly &amp; Clandinin, 1988) have provided further insights into how the collective expression of these teachers might be displayed. The primary preoccupation of the portraits is the teachers&#8223; provision of support for individual students, and the nature and quality of the relationships enlisted in the service of making this provision. The teachers&#8223; transactions on behalf of these students are indicative of a raft of values, ideals, collaborative and communication skills which might be subsumed by the term relatedness, and the ability to see astutely the elements in various situations that need attentiveness. Their practice in action appears to be best encapsulated by Van Manen&#8223;s (1995) term &#8220;pedagogical tact&#8221;, a term borrowed to capture the nature of the pedagogical relationships infused into their personal and professional selves. Three views of practice are provided to display and illuminate the nature of the six exemplary teachers&#8223; collective practice &#8211; View 1: &#8220;From the inside&#8221; which reveals the metaphors that inhabit their practice and the significance they have for their practice; View 2: &#8220;From the outside&#8221; which, through the vehicle of a narrative highlights a STLD teacher and a classroom teacher undertaking a collaborative process of providing for Dayne a student experiencing significant difficulties; View 3: &#8220;Thinking together&#8221; which provides an edited script elicited from a conversation of the participating exemplary STLD teachers. Collectively, the three views reveal what is at the heart of learning support for the six teachers. In addition, aspects of practical knowledge that are particularly pertinent to learning support practice are discussed. 7 Finally, the effectiveness of the methods adopted for the study is explored. First, the screening process successfully enabled the selection of participants who had developed their craft to a sophisticated degree enhanced by their own &#8220;personal signature&#8221; (Eisner, 1991). Second, the adoption of a combination of a social constructivist framework and phenomenological approaches provided appropriate vehicles to enable the construction of six portraits of practices that exemplified significant aspects of practice. Third, the difficulties of authenticating the portraits using a cohort of critical friends from the STLD community and forging links with the community are discussed. Finally, I raise the possibility of embedding the portraits in professional development contexts where early career STLD teachers may wish to reflect on their practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning support, exemplary, pedagogical relationships, practical knowledge, phenomenology, social constructivism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205299</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Cyril Scott&#8217;s Aesthetic Thinking: An Interpretation Informed by Literary and Biographical Sources</field><field name="creator">Sarah Siobhan Collins</field><field name="description">Musicological studies into the works of English composer, Cyril Scott (1879-1970), will almost ubiquitously include a brief and circumspect reference to his avowed &#8220;occult&#8221; interests. Considered for a time to be one of the most promising talents of the English Musical Renaissance, Scott is certainly a figure of great interest in the context of British music history; however, the fanatical nature of his personal activities and belief system have typically dissuaded researchers from venturing beyond a bare consideration of his music. The source of the academic reluctance is clear&#8212;those interested in pursuing Scott&#8217;s biographical details any further than the scant outline often provided are confronted with references to secret occult circles, Masters and sw&#226;mis, gnomes and angels, the &#8220;sheaths of the soul,&#8221; clairaudient investigations and disembodied Tibetan organists. The impenetrable character of Scott&#8217;s belief system has led to the arbitrary application of such cover-all terms as &#8220;mystical&#8221; or &#8220;Theosophical&#8221; in its description, thereby effectively sealing shut a potential hermeneutic gateway into his musical output, and eluding a further understanding of the man himself. Much of the biographical information currently available on Scott relies almost solely on the detail provided in the composer&#8217;s own two autobiographies. These are clearly problematic sources on which to base our understanding, for a number of reasons. The difficulties associated with approaching Scott&#8217;s belief system are similar to those regarding his biographical detail, including issues of authenticity, representation and &#8220;veiling.&#8221; As a result, much of Scott&#8217;s thinking has remained hidden in his sizable literary oeuvre, untouched by musicologists. Within his literary output is revealed a distinct line of developing aesthetic thought, culminating in a theory which he considered to have been his greatest literary contribution. By examining Scott&#8217;s literary output and extrapolating new biographical detail from other sources, there begins to appear a clearer picture of how Scott&#8217;s aesthetic thinking gradually became intimately entwined in, and driven by, his developing philosophical outlook and spiritual beliefs. It is the contention of this thesis that Scott&#8217;s aesthetic thought, rather than falling within an &#8220;Orientalist&#8221; or merely &#8220;Theosophical&#8221; construct, was actually firmly rooted in the aestheticism of modernist anti-rationalist philosophies traditionally associated with certain literary movements, particularly Symbolism. From this characterisation, the present study will explore Scott&#8217;s aesthetic theorizing within the framework of his spiritual development. Its purpose is to initiate a new and more comprehensive platform from which to approach Scott&#8217;s music and also to raise new questions regarding the impact of the aesthetics of particular literary trends on the position of music within early twentieth-century aesthetic theories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyril Scott (1879-1970), English music history, late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, aesthetics, modernism.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205375</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charged Liposaccharide Based Drug Delivery Systems</field><field name="creator">Adel Abdel Rahim</field><field name="description">Abstract Many hydrophilic drugs do not easily cross biological membranes. One approach to improve intestinal absorption of hydrophilic compounds is to co-administer these drug molecules with absorption enhancers to optimize their physico-chemical properties. In this project, novel liposaccharides were used to modulate the aqueous solubility as well as increase the lipophilicity, improve the intestinal permeability and hence, oral bioavailability of hydrophilic molecules. However, the solubility of the drug/liposaccharide mixtures in aqueous system might be poor, therefore, introducing a hydrophilic component such as quaternization of amine derivatives or sodium salt of carboxylic acid is required to modulate hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and in the same time and promote surfactant and ion pairing characteristics of these derivatives. This dissertation illustrates the development of novel liposaccharide absorption enhancers to be used for oral delivery of hydrophilic drugs. This research includes chemical synthesis of new ionic liposaccharides, examination of their physico-chemical properties, and their in vitro and in vivo biological examinations. The work consists of two parts; cationic and anionic liposaccharide absorption enhancers. a) Cationic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers The focus of this work was on the molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel cationic liposaccharide derivatives as drug delivery agents to improve the oral bioavailability of piperacillin as a model hydrophilic drug. These derivatives were designed to possess surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible and biodegradable materials such as glucose, lipoamino acids and lipophilic amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of piperacillin/liposaccharide conjugates were studied to investigate the effect of liposaccharides on piperacillin activity. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers for the oral delivery of piperacillin was assessed in vitro (Caco-2 cells) and in vivo (rat oral absorption). It was concluded that these derivatives did show hemolytic activity in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity), while they increased permeability of piperacillin through Caco-2 cells. However, these promising results obtained from in vitro assay were not confirmed in vivo. viii b) Anionic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers In this thesis, molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel anionic liposaccharide derivatives as absorption enhancers to improve the intestinal permeability of a model hydrophilic drug such as tobramycin were carried out. These derivatives were designed to have surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible materials such as sugar, lipoamino acids and amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Many absorption enhancers have (to some extent) cytotoxic activity, therefore, cytotoxic activity of the novel anionic liposaccharides were examined. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers to increase the lipophilicity of tobramycin and hence, its oral bioavailability, was evaluated through carrying out partition coefficient examination. It was concluded that these derivatives did not show haemolytic and cytotoxic activities in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity). In addition, the permeability of tobramycin into the organic phase (n-octanol) was increased when liposaccharide derivatives were used. The obtained results are promising and encouraging to continue the work to include Caco-2 cells assay (in vitro assay) and oral absorption in rats (in vivo assay) as a prospective work in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sugar, lipoamino acids, amino acids cationic liposaccharides, anionic liposaccharides.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205496</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic Properties of Cerium Oxides:Towards an Effective Valence Model Hamiltonian</field><field name="creator">Elvis Shoko</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis is to develop a minimal model Hamiltonian to describe the electronic properties of ceria (CeO$_{2}$) and its reduced phases. In order to do this, several energy scales of the problem were explored to determine their relative significance to the problem. These included the crystal electric field ($\Delta_{CEF}$), the spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda_{so}$), electron hopping ($t$), on-site Coulomb repulsion for the Ce $4f$ states ($U$), the reorganization energy ($\lambda_{0}$), the direct exchange ($J$) and the energy gap between the oxygen valence band level and the cerium $4f$ states ($\Gamma\epsilon$). Once the relative magnitudes of the various energy scales were determined, it was then possible to define a minimal set of degrees of freedom required to obtain a meaningful description of the system in the minimal model. The first task was to obtain baseline data for both CeO$_{2}$ and Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$ as well as the metallic phases of Ce. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed on these materials to obtain band structures as well as structural properties. The DFT results indicated that both the LDA and GGA functionals perform poorly for $\gamma$-Ce and Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$. In the case of Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$, both LDA and GGA give a metallic ground state contrary to the insulator observed in experiment. The first set of energy scales that were investigated included the crystal electric field and the spin-orbit coupling. Since these calculations, except for the presence of a crystal field, involve an isolated Ce ion, the energy scales associated with spin and charge fluctuations at a Ce site are ignored. In order to perform these calculations, it was necessary to determine the $f^{n}$ configuration at each Ce site in the various phases of the oxides. This was achieved by a simple empirical model called the bond valence model. The bond valence model provides a method for calculating site valences in crystals from bond length data alone. Apart from getting information about the $f^{n}$ configurations at the various Ce sites, the results of the bond valence analysis revealed that there was significant mixed valence in the different phases of the cerium oxies. In addition, it was possible to characterize the charge distribution in the local environment of the oxygen vacancies from the bond valence results. This analysis led to the important result that the charge prefers Ce sites farthest away from the oxygen vacancy. This is contrary to the widely accepted view that the extra charge resulting from oxygen vacancy formation localizes on Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. The LDA calculations which support the widely accepted view do not properly treat electron correlations. Thus this is an important result which emphasizes the role of strong electron correlations in the processes of oxidation and reduction in these materials. The results of the crystal field calculations were not quantitative because we could not find data on crystal field parameters which is required to evaluate the matrix elements. However, it is expected that the splitting of the $f$ manifold by the crystal fields will be smaller than that of the spin-orbit coupling energy which is of the order of $0.07\unit{eV}$. Results for the Hubbard $U$ parameter in Ce oxides were obtained from the literature but these vary widely and fall in the range $1.0 - 10.5\unit{eV}$. The reorganization energy reported from spectroscopic results of the intervalence transition band for reduced ceria is $1.4\unit{eV}$. Tight-binding calculations were performed for CeO$_{2}$ to obtain the energy band structure for this material. It was then possible to extract from these results the matrix elements for electron hopping. The sizes of the matrix elements obtained suggested that the direct $f$-$f$ hopping between Ce sites ($t_{ff}$) is of order $0.02\unit{eV}$ which is negligible compared to the indirect hopping via an O atom (i.e., $t_{eff}$) which is of order $0.2\unit{eV}$. The hopping matrix element between a Ce site and a neighbouring O atom ($t_{fp}$) is even higher $\sim 0.5\unit{eV}$. The role of multiple orbitals on a Ce site was explored to determine the minimal set of orbitals to include in the effective model Hamiltonian. The results indicated that the essential physics could be described well by replacing the $4f$ manifold with two orbitals on a Ce site. The magnitudes of the energy scales of the problem decrease in the order $U &gt; \lambda_{0} &gt; t_{fp}&gt;t_{eff} &gt;\lambda_{so} \gg t_{ff} \approx \Delta_{CEF} \approx J$ with a high uncertainty on the last two relationships. The results of the above analysis led us to the conclusion that the only relevant energy scales for the effective model Hamiltonian are the On-site Coulomb repulsion for the Ce $4f$ states ($U$) and electron hopping between a Ce site and a neighbouring O site ($t_{fp}$). A minimal model Hamiltonian was then constructed to take into account the spin and charge fluctuations on a Ce site due to electron hopping between the Ce site and neighbouring O atoms. In this description, the strongly correlated ground states of cerium oxides is then described by a variational wavefunction whose main feature is that double occupancy of a Ce $f$ orbital is prohibited.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205515</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive crosstalk cancellation and Lattice aided detection in multi-user communications</field><field name="creator">Mandar Gujrathi</field><field name="description">Digital subscriber lines (DSL) have revolutionised the provision of high speed data over the &#8216;last mile&#8217;. Subscribers demand even more bandwidth and the penetration of the service is now nearly universal. While it is feasible to provide improved broadband services on the new very high speed DSL, such as VDSL2/3, one of the greatest challenges to further improvements in speed is the problem of crosstalk. Operating over the unused higher frequencies of the twisted pair network, this technology is subjected to electromagnetic coupling among the wires, limiting the DSL data rate and service reach. Crosstalk suppression methods such as zero-forcing or decision feedback mainly use block processing. However, to cope with the time-varying VDSL environment huge computational costs can be incurred. In contrast, adaptive processing approaches are much simpler and are more beneficial to track such a channel environment. An adaptive canceller uses a training sequence and the convergence speed depends on the number of crosstalk coefficients it has to estimate. In a populated DSL binder, only a few of the crosstalking neighbours to a particular user are significant. With the aim to reduce the computational complexity in such environments, this thesis introduces the concept of detection-guided adaptive crosstalk cancellation for DSL. We propose a least-squares test feature to detect and concentrate the adaptation only on the dominant crosstalking coefficients. In comparison to conventional adaptive cancellers, the cancellers proposed in this thesis demonstrate early convergence. Thus, by incorporating the test feature, these cancellers have to detect only the most significant canceller coefficients and therefore, the length of the training sequence is reduced. Together with enhanced adaptive cancellation with a low run-time complexity and improved convergence, the greatest advantage obtained here is in the bandwidth efficiency. While enhanced adaptive cancellation is a bandwidth-efficient approach, the frequent re-transmission of training sequences may still be required for a rapidly changing VDSL channel. Again, this can be a disadvantage in terms of bandwidth consumption. To overcome this difficulty, we propose fast-converging unsupervised cancellers with an aim to improve the bandwidth efficiency by not transmitting a training sequence. An added advantage obtained here is that this would enable Internet service providers to include multiple or improved broadband services within a single subscription. Certain properties of the DSL channel ensure the communication channel is properly conditioned. This ensures the basis vectors of the channel matrix are near-orthogonal and hence, the linear cancellers, such as zero-forcing perform near-optimally. However, this is not the case with wireless channels. We investigate user detection in wireless channels using the principle of lattice reduction. User detection can also be seen as a search for the closest vector point in the lattice of received symbols. Though a maximum likelihood (ML) detector facilitates optimal user-detection, it has exponential complexity. We identify that the closest vector problem can be cast as a non-linear optimisation problem. Using the periodicity of the maximum likelihood function, we first present a novel algorithm that approximates the ML function using the Taylor series expansion of a suitable cosine function. With the aim of minimising the approximation error, we represent the ML function as a Fourier Series expansion and later, propose another approximation using Jacobi theta functions. We study the performance of these approximations when subjected to a suitable unconstrained optimisation algorithm. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the newly-developed approximations perform better than the conventional cancellers, close to the ML and, importantly, converging in polynomial time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive, partial crosstalk cancellation, detection guided, blind crosstalk cancellation, adaptation, activity criterion, lattice reduction, Jacobi-theta function approximation, Taylor series approximation, non-linear optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205528</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital technologies and multimodal communication in the chemistry classroom</field><field name="creator">Annette Hilton</field><field name="description">Students of chemistry encounter difficulties due to its abstract nature and the need to understand and communicate its concepts on macro, submicro, and symbolic levels using a range of representations and representational modes. Research suggests that when students are required to use multiple representations they have difficulties in understanding individual representations and in negotiating meaning through their use. This study sought to address these issues through the application of digital technologies. The main areas of research that provided a theoretical framework for this study were multiple representations in chemistry education and writing-to-learn in science. Other research in these areas has suggested that a better understanding of multiple representations might enhance students&#8217; chemical literacy; however, limited research has investigated the impact of using digital technologies to create multimodal texts on students&#8217; learning in chemistry, particularly the development of students&#8217; skills in generating and integrating multiple representations. Until recently, much of the writing-to-learn research has focused on written composition. The knowledge-transforming model was proposed by Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) to explain the influence of written composition on knowledge construction. However, having been developed prior to the time when students had ready access to digital technologies and a consequent capacity to create multimedia and digital texts, this model does not account for the production of such multimodal texts. This study examined the effect of learning experiences that utilised digital technologies to support students in using multiple representations and through writing-to-learn activities to create multimodal texts on learning outcomes in chemistry. The study was conducted in a metropolitan public co-educational high school in Queensland, Australia. Two Year 11 chemistry classes participated in the study, which was conducted in the first term of a 2-year course in which students learn chemistry as a separate discipline. The study consisted of a pilot study and an intervention study with two phases. The pilot study was used to trial the learning activities and data collection instruments and to gain an insight into instructional approaches that might be appropriate for the study. Phase 1 of the intervention study employed a pretest&#8211;posttest design. In this phase, students learned about chemical bonding and structure and their effects on the properties and behaviours of different materials. They also learned about the multiple representations used to understand and communicate about chemical bonding and structure. Within a modified crossover design, Phase 2 of the study employed mixed methods to compare the effects on learning outcomes when they created two different scientific texts: a digital poster and a laboratory report. Both text types required students to integrate multiple representations to report on their learning during laboratory investigations. These text types were chosen because they are commonly used by scientists to communicate their experimental findings. In Phase 1, students engaged in computer-based inquiries using both molecular modelling and simulation software to investigate phenomena such as intra- and inter-molecular bonding and their effects on properties, the differences between various types of bonds, the multiple representations used to describe and investigate bonding and structure, and to present their understanding to others. In Phase 2, students used a range of scaffolding resources to design and carry out two inquiries about the chemistry of biomaterials. In the first inquiry, students made and compared the properties of two different bioplastic films; in the second, students compared the relative fermentation rates of a range of carbohydrates. In both inquiries, students were required to report their findings and explain them on the submicro level using appropriate representations. Scaffolds included Science Writing Heuristics, which explicitly required students to consider which multiple representations would support their claims and explanations of data; digital resources for selecting, modifying, or creating representations; and genre templates. Pretest&#8211;posttest comparisons for both phases showed that the instructional approaches and resources used were effective for enhancing students&#8217; learning outcomes. In all comparisons, the posttest performances were significantly higher. In the first phase, several of the identified alternative or missing conceptions about chemical bonding were effectively addressed, and in both phases, students&#8217; conceptual understanding and their representational competencies were enhanced. The pretest&#8211;posttest comparisons for Phase 2 suggested that creating a diversified text &#8211; a digital poster &#8211; for explaining experimental results is at least as effective for enhancing understanding and representational competencies as creating a more traditional laboratory report. Other data were analysed to gain an insight into how or why the instructional strategies and resources used might have been effective. The student interviews revealed a number of advantages of using digital technologies, including promotion of higher order thinking, enhanced motivation and interest, the capacity of digital technologies to support and enhance visualisation, and the production of multiple representations in multiple modes. Students suggested that the digital resources allowed them to make links between macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic levels and to include a range of representations in their explanations. The evaluation questionnaire revealed similar trends. Analysis of the students&#8217; texts suggested that the approaches used in Phase 2 were effective in supporting students&#8217; content and rhetorical problem solving and the interactions between the two. Students utilised a range of representations, particularly structural diagrams, when making explanations of their macroscopic data on the submicro level. This study has implications for the instructional approaches used by chemistry teachers because it showed that integrating digital technologies into learning environments is effective when introducing students to the multiple representations used in chemistry and in the development of students&#8217; chemical literacies. It also contributes to writing-to-learn research by focusing on multimodal communication and the benefits of creating multimodal texts for presenting, organising, and explaining data, and for representing knowledge. Significant findings of the study relate to the importance of digital technologies in generating multimodal texts and representations for instruction, scaffolding, and in student-centred inquiry-based learning. Further research might focus on the use of such resources for addressing other commonly identified alternative conceptions, the creation of other multimodal text types, the use of other digital technologies or authoring tools, or on the development of teachers&#8217; technological pedagogical content knowledge, which is required for effective classroom implementation of these resources and strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">chemistry education</field><field name="subject">writing-to-learn</field><field name="subject">multimodality</field><field name="subject">multiple representations</field><field name="subject">representational competence</field><field name="subject">educational technology</field><field name="subject">chemical literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205719</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Immunological Investigation of Salivary Gland Antigens of the Australian Paralysis Tick Ixodes holocyclus for the Development of Toxin-Specific Immunoassays</field><field name="creator">Sonja Hall-Mendelin</field><field name="description">The Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus causes a potentially fatal paralysis in domestic animals, livestock and humans with companion animals (mainly dogs) most commonly affected. Current treatment regimes include administration of a commercial tick anti-serum (TAS), prepared as hyperimmune serum in dogs, to neutralise the effects of the toxin. However, each new batch must be standardised using an expensive and highly subjective bioassay performed in neonatal mice. There is currently an urgent need for a more cost effective and rapid in vitro assay that can be more objectively and accurately quantified. Further understanding of the composition of the toxin molecule is also required to develop toxin-specific reagents necessary for these assays. One of the main objectives of this study was to develop a suitable immunoassay to replace the existing mouse bioassay for assessing batches of tick anti-sera for use in tick paralysis therapy in dogs. Initially an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to detect and quantify antibody specific for I. holocyclus toxin in dog sera. Using a partially purified antigen extracted from I. holocyclus salivary glands, good discrimination was achieved between reactive (hyperimmune) and non-reactive (na&#239;ve) sera. The hyperimmune dog sera reacted very strongly with the antigen compared to negligible reactions of serum from dogs not exposed to I. holocyclus. The reactions of hyperimmune sera were also significantly weaker to a non-toxin antigen control extracted from the salivary glands of the non-toxic tick Rhipicephalus microplus, indicating the assay was detecting toxin-specific responses. Furthermore, each of the hyperimmune sera that reacted strongly and specifically with the I. holocyclus antigen in the ELISA also strongly neutralised toxin in the mouse bioassay. Together these findings support the suitability of this ELISA for assessing the potency of batches of commercial dog hyperimmune sera for use as therapy for tick paralysis in dogs. Sera from dogs that were experimentally infested with ticks and sera from patient dogs, presenting at veterinary clinics with signs of tick paralysis, were also screened for antibodies to I. holocyclus antigen using the ELISA. Twenty-eight out of 29 sera from animals with single or multiple exposures to ticks failed to recognise the I. holocyclus antigen indicating the ELISA is not suitable as a diagnostic test to detect toxin-specific antibodies in animals with limited exposure to I. holocyclus infestation. A panel of toxin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was produced as research tools to analyse and purify tick toxin components. Rats were successfully immunised against tick toxin using a combination of inoculation of partially purified salivary gland antigen and exposure to tick infestation. The latter approach preserved the native confirmation of the toxin using a natural route of immunisation and rats were chosen due to their high tolerance of multiple tick infestations over several days. While fusion of rat spleen cells with mouse myeloma cells has been reported several times in the literature, the resulting hybridomas are unstable with fastidious culture requirements. Optimisation of the culture conditions revealed that most rat-mouse hybridoma lines grew best in serum-free medium supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum. Of 600 hybridomas produced, only 12 were shown to be specific for the Ixodes antigen, as determined by ELISA. A selection of these hybridomas representing various patterns of affinity and/or antigen specificity were further analysed for toxin-neutralising ability in a mouse bioassay. Notably, the most potent toxin-neutralising mAb in mice, showed a specific but relatively moderate reaction to Ixodes antigen in the ELISA. The most potent toxin-neutralising mAbs inactivated toxin as strongly as the commercial TAS used for immunotherapy in dogs with tick paralysis. This suggests that mAbs may present an alternative source of immunotherapy, providing a potentially endless supply of a highly consistent reagent and negating the need to use live animals for both the production of tick antiserum and the continual testing of reagent batches. The toxin-neutralising mAbs were also used to analyse I. holocyclus toxin in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot to identify specific toxin proteins. The most potent neutralising mAbs consistently recognised high MW proteins (100-200 kDa) in a smeared pattern. Although this was contrary to previous reports of low molecular weight components (3-5 kDa) in holocyclotoxin, this study was the first to use mAbs prepared to native toxin. The large molecular weight structures likely represent presucursors to, or complexes of the smaller peptides, previously identified. When the Toxin-neutralising mAbs were assessed as ligands to affinity purify toxin components from crude Ixodes SG extracts, toxin components of 110 and 32 kDa were consistently identified. These purified proteins represent good candidates for N-terminal sequencing to further identify the toxin components in I.holocyclus salivary glands.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Ixodes holocyclus, tick salivary gland antigen, toxin, ELISA, monoclonal antibody, toxin-neutralisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205787</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADVANCED APPROACHES FOR ELECTRICITY MARKET PRICE FORECASTING</field><field name="creator">Xia Chen</field><field name="description">Electricity price forecasting is an important task for electricity market participants since the very beginning of the deregulation. Accurate forecasting is essential for designing bidding strategy, risk management, and market operation. However, due to the compli-cated factors affecting electricity prices, there are more uncertainties in electricity price forecasting and hence more complex than demand forecasting. This makes accurate price forecasting very difficult. In the last decade, several methods have been developed in order to fully capture the peculiarities of electricity price dynamics, from classic econometric time series models, e.g., autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model to modern machine learning based techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and sup-port vector machine (SVM). In spite of all models proposed in the literature, there is still no clear consensus about which model is substantively outperforming others. Therefore, when a single method is used, decision-makers are facing the risk of not choosing the best one. On the other hand, the prediction of electricity market prices still involves large errors. If decision-makers take the prediction result on faith, prediction errors could exposure them to serious financial risks. Based on these findings, it can conclude that (1) systematic methodologies and implementations which can efficiently address model selection uncertainty in price forecasting require an investigation; (2) more powerful and robust price forecasting models are still needed to reduce the fore-cast errors; and (3) In addition, the emphasis of price forecasting should shift away from point forecast to uncertainty around the forecast. Unfortunately, most researches in this area have been devoted to finding the single &#8220;best&#8221; estimates rather than dealing with the uncertainty in model selection and quantifying the predictive uncertainty. In this thesis the research focus is on: (1) finding methodologies and efficient imple-mentations to deal with the uncertainty in model selection; (2) developing more power-ful machine learning based approaches to model electricity spot prices and further im-proving the accuracy of electricity market price forecast; and (3) incorporating uncer-tainty estimation into the application of price forecasting. The thesis makes three main contributions to the study of this topic. Firstly, it proposes linear, nonlinear forecast combination frameworks to deal with model selection prob-lem; secondly, it introduces two novel models: support vector machine based nonlinear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (SVM-GARCH) and extreme learning machine (ELM) to the price forecasting and furthermore gives a series of bootstrap-based interval construction procedures to quantify the prediction uncer-tainty. Finally, it proposes a more robust interval forecasting approach which is based on quantile regression to electricity price forecasting literature. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches have been tested based on real market data of Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Electricity market price forecasting, model uncertainty, probabilistic interval forecasting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206035</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Effects of Nanoparticle Dispersion on Physical and Mechanical Properties of HA/PHBV Nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Wadcharawadee Noohom</field><field name="description">This thesis is inspired by a persistent limitation in the use of composite biomaterials for orthopaedic applications, namely the agglomeration of reinforcing particles in these composites, which has resulted in poor mechanical properties. The use of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to produce biodegradable nanocomposites is investigated. More specifically, the thesis investigates different methods of composite processing, and interfacial modifying agents and the effect that these have on the nano- and micro- scale structure of composites and their mechanical properties. PHBV and HA were chosen because PHBV is a biodegradable/biocompatible polymer and it has a relatively high stiffness when compared to other biodegradable polymers frequently used in orthopaedic applications. HA is chemically similar to ceramic phase found in bones and hard tissues and the inclusion of HA into biomedical materials has been shown to enhance the rate of osteoconduction. HA/PHBV composites were produced using different dispersing agents including poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), a model dispersing agent, polyethyleneimine (PEI) which allowed for the development of a single solvent system for composite preparation, and heparin (Hep), a macromolecule which is produced in vivo. Additionally, HA/PAA/PHBV composites were prepared from both sonicated and non-sonicated HA/PAA suspensions up to approximately 17% by weight (wt %) of HA content. Attempts to prepare composites with higher HA loadings led to inhomogeneous composite mixtures, which were caused by the dual solvent system used for the composite preparation. The HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites were produced up to approximately 75 wt % of HA content. It was found that the HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites could be prepared at higher loadings than HA/PAA/PHBV composites due to the single solvent system used for the preparation of the HA/PEI/PHBV composites and the better dispersion of HA/Hep particles in precursor suspensions. Finally, selected HA/PEI/PHBV composites were further processed using a twin screw extruder. All of the composites were characterised in terms of their dispersion levels as well as their compressive mechanical properties. In addition, HA/PEI/PHBV composite reinforced with 20 wt % of HA content was also tested for its mechanical properties using three different test types; compression, three-point bending, and tensile tests. Finally, the HA/PAA/PHBV, HA/PEI/PHBV, and HA/Hep/PHBV composites were tested their compressive mechanical properties in wet state. It was found that the sonicated HA/PAA suspensions in general had better colloidal stability than non-sonicated ones and that this yielded composites with superior compressive moduli than those prepared from non-sonicated suspensions. In addition, the better dispersion of the particles in the composites prepared from the sonicated suspensions, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images, led to higher percentage crystallinities when compared to the composites prepared from non-sonicated suspensions. It is likely that the greater number of individual HA particles and smaller HA agglomerates observed in the composites prepared from sonication treatment are acting as nuclei for crystal growth more effectively than large HA agglomerates. The largest modulus and yield strength that could be achieved with this system were approximately 1.45 GPa and 80 MPa, respectively. Composites of HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV with approximately 55 wt % of HA content were found to exhibit the largest compressive moduli of approximately 2.5 and 2.8 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the yield strengths for the same materials were found to be approximately 123 and 120 MPa, respectively. This was found to correlate with the better levels of dispersion within the nanocomposites that could be achieved using these stabilisers. The extruded samples were found to have an even greater degree of particle dispersion when compared to the unextruded ones. This improved degree of particle dispersion of the extruded samples resulted in higher moduli in comparison to unextruded samples. The largest compressive modulus and yield strength of the extruded samples were found to be approximately 3.2 GPa and 125 MPa, respectively. The compressive moduli of the composites produced in this thesis are significantly greater than that of cancellous bone (0.4 GPa), but significantly lower than that of cortical bone (12.8&#8211;17.7 GPa). However, maximum yield strengths of the HA/PEI/PHBV and HA/Hep/PHBV composites match to cortical bone (120&#8211;180 MPa), which is a noteworthy finding in this thesis. The wet mechanical results of all composites as well as pure PHBV polymer showed a reduction in both moduli and yield strengths when compared to dry state. In addition, after 2 weeks in wet state both moduli and yield strengths of the composites and pure polymer converged to approximately the same values. Finally, the HA/PEI/PHBV composite samples tested by tensile testing showed the highest Young&#8217;s modulus and those tested by compression testing possessed the lowest Young&#8217;s modulus. This resulted from the difference in periods of time for heating exposure and void contents of the tested samples, which were prepared by different methods. However, toughness values obtained from the samples tested using three-point bending and tensile tests, was not significantly different.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydroxyapatite, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), composites, nano-sized, dispersion, mechanical properties, Young&#8217;s modulus, strength, crystallinities, bone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206173</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Active Learning: experimental factors and membership query learning</field><field name="creator">Yu-hui Yeh</field><field name="description">The field of Machine Learning is concerned with the development of algorithms, models and techniques that solve challenging computational problems by learning from data representative of the problem (e.g. given a set of medical images previously classified by a human expert, build a model to predict unseen images as either benign or malignant). Many important real-world problems have been formulated as supervised learning problems. The assumption is that a data set is available containing the correct output (e.g. class label or target value) for each given data point. In many application domains, obtaining the correct outputs (labels) for data points is a costly and time-consuming task. This has provided the motivation for the development of Machine Learning techniques that attempt to minimize the number of labeled data points while maintaining good generalization performance on a given problem. Active Learning is one such class of techniques and is the focus of this thesis. Active Learning algorithms select or generate unlabeled data points to be labeled and use these points for learning. If successful, an Active Learning algorithm should be able to produce learning performance (e.g test set error) comparable to an equivalent supervised learner using fewer labeled data points. Theoretical, algorithmic and experimental Active Learning research has been conducted and a number of successful applications have been demonstrated. However, the scope of many of the experimental studies on Active Learning has been relatively small and there are very few large-scale experimental evaluations of Active Learning techniques. A significant amount of performance variability exists across Active Learning experimental results in the literature. Furthermore, the implementation details and effects of experimental factors have not been closely examined in empirical Active Learning research, creating some doubt over the strength and generality of conclusions that can be drawn from such results. The Active Learning model/system used in this thesis is the Optimal Active Learning algorithm framework with Gaussian Processes for regression problems (however, most of the research questions are of general interest in many other Active Learning scenarios). Experimental and implementation details of the Active Learning system used are described in detail, using a number of regression problems and datasets of different types. It is shown that the experimental results of the system are subject to significant variability across problem datasets. The hypothesis that experimental factors can account for this variability is then investigated. The results show the impact of sampling and sizes of the datasets used when generating experimental results. Furthermore, preliminary experimental results expose performance variability across various real-world regression problems. The results suggest that these experimental factors can (to a large extent) account for the variability observed in experimental results. A novel resampling technique for Optimal Active Learning, called '3-Sets Cross-Validation', is proposed as a practical solution to reduce experimental performance variability. Further results confirm the usefulness of the technique. The thesis then proposes an extension to the Optimal Active Learning framework, to perform learning via membership queries via a novel algorithm named MQOAL. The MQOAL algorithm employs the Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample data points for query selection. Experimental results show that MQOAL provides comparable performance to the pool-based OAL learner, using a very generic, simple MCMC technique, and is robust to experimental factors related to the MCMC implementation. The possibility of making queries in batches is also explored experimentally, with results showing that while some performance degradation does occur, it is minimal for learning in small batch sizes, which is likely to be valuable in some real-world problem domains.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active learning</field><field name="subject">probabilistic data selection</field><field name="subject">experimental factor</field><field name="subject">cross-validation</field><field name="subject">membership query</field><field name="subject">gaussian processes</field><field name="subject">markov chain monte carlo</field><field name="subject">batch learning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206198</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accent Classification from Speech Samples by Use of Machine Learning</field><field name="creator">Carol Pedersen</field><field name="description">&#8220;Accent&#8221; is the pattern of speech pronunciation by which one can identify a person&#8217;s linguistic, social or cultural background. It is an important source of inter-speaker variability and a particular problem for automated speech recognition. The aim of the study was to investigate a new computational approach to accent classification which did not require phonemic segmentation or the identification of phonemes as input, and which could therefore be used as a simple, effective accent classifier. Through a series of structured experiments this study investigated the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for speech accent classification using time-based units rather than linguistically-informed ones, and compared it to the accuracy of other machine learning methods, as well as the ability of humans to classify speech according to accent. A corpus of read-speech was collected in two accents of English (Arabic and &#8220;Indian&#8221;) and used as the main datasource for the experiments. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients were extracted from the speech samples and combined into larger units of 10 to 150ms duration, which then formed the input data for the various machine learning systems. Support Vector Machines were found to classify the samples with up to 97.5% accuracy with very high precision and recall, using samples of between 1 and 4 seconds of speech. This compared favourably with a human listener study where subjects were able to distinguish between the two accent groups with an average of 92.5% accuracy in approximately 8 seconds. Repeating the SVM experiments on a different corpus resulted in a best classification accuracy of 84.6%. Experiments using a decision tree learner and a rule-based classifier on the original corpus gave a best accuracy of 95% but results over the range of conditions were much more variable than those using the SVM. Rule extraction was performed in order to help explain the results and better inform the design of the system. The new approach was therefore shown to be effective for accent classification, and a plan for its role within various other larger speech-related contexts was developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">accent</field><field name="subject">accent classification</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">support vector machines</field><field name="subject">mel-frequency cepstral coefficients</field><field name="subject">rule extraction</field><field name="subject">human listeners</field><field name="subject">corpus evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;Only another mother would understand&#8221; Parents&#8217; experiences of feeding their children with complex medical conditions</field><field name="creator">Lyndal Franklin</field><field name="description">With advances in neonatal, medical and surgical care there are an increasing number of infants and young children surviving with medical conditions. Many of these children have associated complex feeding difficulties as a result of the disruption to early oral feeding experiences and periods of restricted or non-oral feeding. These children are at risk of developing long-term feeding difficulties associated with sub-optimal nutrition and poor appetite regulation, delays in mastering skills that lead to eating and mealtime independence, and disruptive mealtime behaviours. Managing the extraordinary demands associated with feeding and ensuring nutrition for these children can present significant challenges for parents as well as health care professionals involved in their care. Occupational therapists are often core members of multidisciplinary teams providing hospital-based services to these children and their families. Embracing an occupation-centred perspective, participation in feeding and mealtimes are considered important co-occupations for infants, children and their parents and carers that occur within the context of parenting and family life. Understanding these contextual influences and the occupational needs of parents are essential but have been understated in the occupational therapy literature and clinical practice. This thesis describes a qualitative study using a phenomenological perspective to explore the lived experiences of parents of children with complex medical and feeding difficulties. Parents from fourteen families participated in the study. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, family mealtime observations and demographic questionnaires. Key findings indicated that parents experienced a high degree of stress in their everyday lives as a result of their children&#8217;s feeding difficulties, especially in relation to tube-feeding. Mothers&#8217; self-image was devastated because they believed that it was their ultimate responsibility to feed and nourish their children. Differences in how parents identified with and fulfilled their parenting roles and responsibilities emerged, not just in relation to feeding but also for other childcare and domestic activities. Overwhelmingly, it was mothers who assumed the greater share of these parenting responsibilities, and in addition, expressed a sense of responsibility for preserving family unity and the need to get on with family life despite the chronic nature of their children&#8217;s problems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the occupational challenges for parents of these children, especially mothers who have a primary role in feeding, and the impact of feeding disruptions on the lives of their families. This knowledge will assist clinicians providing feeding interventions to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of both parents and other family members. Recommendations for clinical practice are proposed.

AVs possess large double stranded DNA genomes ranging from 116-186 kbp. Recently, genomes of four AV species have been completely sequenced and have revealed important genes potentially needed for virus DNA replication and infection. Phylogenetic analyses of several of these genes indicate that AVs are closely related to iridoviruses and likely evolved from them. Two unique features, mode of transmission and cytopathology which involves cleavage of cells into virus-containing vesicles, make AVs different from other insect pathogenic viruses. During this decade, tremendous advancements in the study of RNA silencing mechanisms have openned a new dimension in virology. It is now evident that viruses reshape the cellular environment by reprogramming host RNA silencing machinery. The process of RNA silencing involves small non-coding RNAs, which with the help of nuclease-containing regulatory proteins bind to complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, resulting in inhibition of gene expression. This sophisticated style of gene regulation has attained a fundamental status in living organisms, since RNA silencing has been revealed to be ubiquitous from viruses to prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Two main categories of small RNAs, short interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have been defined as major players in RNA silencing. Interestingly, viral genomes like that of their hosts, encode miRNAs that can be used during virus invasion to manipulate host genes as well as miRNA biogenesis. Here, we report on the identification of the first insect virus miRNA (HvAVmiR- 1) derived from the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of Heliothis virescens ascovirus 7 (HvAV3e). HvAV-miR-1 expression was found to be strictly regulated and specifically detected from 96 h post-infection. HvAV-miR-1 expression coincides with a marked reduction of the expression of HvAV3e DNA polymerase I, which is a predicted target. Ectopic expression of the full-length and truncated versions of MCP retaining the miRNA sequence significantly reduced DNA polymerase I transcript levels and inhibited viral replication. Our results indicate that HvAV-miR-1 directs degradation of DNA polymerase I transcripts and regulates replication of HvAV3e. Further, we investigated changes in the expression levels of host miRNAs upon HvAV3e infection in an insect cell line derived from Helicoverpa zea fat body and investigated the role of a host miRNA, Hz-miR24, in the hostvirus system. It was found that Hz-miR24 is differentially expressed following virus infection, with an increase in its expression levels late in infection. Functional analyses demonstrated that Hz-miR24 targets viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and its &#946; subunit mRNAs. This was confirmed using ectopic expression of Hz-miR24 and a green fluorescent protein-based reporter system. Expression of the target gene was substantially enhanced in cells transfected with a synthesized inhibitor of Hz-miR24. These findings suggest that ascoviruses encode their own miRNA(s) and concurrently manipulate host miRNAs that in turn regulate the expression of their genes at specific time points after infection. In connection to RNA silencing, we characterized a ribonuclease III (RNase III) protein encoded by HvAV3e. We found that RNase III protein was functional in vivo as well as in vitro and catalyzed long and short double stranded RNAs. Expression analyses during virus infection revealed autoregulation of this protein by degradation of its RNA transcripts. Moreover, RNase III protein was found to be involved in suppression of RNA silencing and essential for virus DNA replication and infection. Finally, we studied another ascoviral 8 protein, a putative inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), which was found to be essential for virus DNA replication and pathology. Further, despite inhibition of apoptosis by HvAV3e, the IAP-like protein was found dispensable for the inhibition of replication. In conclusion, for successful invasion and attenuation of host antiviral responses, ascoviruses seem to utilize viral encoded proteins as well as miRNAs. Since the genomes of these viruses have only recently been sequenced, the role of many of the encoded genes essential for pathogenesis and manipulation of antiviral defence mechanisms remains to be eluciated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">ascovirus, apoptosis, DNA replication, RNA interference, microRNA, dicer,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calcium influx regulators in mammary gland development and breast cancer: Roles of ORAI and STIM isoforms</field><field name="creator">Damara McAndrew</field><field name="description">Calcium is the major mineral component of milk and is essential for neonatal development. To enrich the milk, calcium must pass from the maternal bloodstream, through mammary epithelial cells, into the alveolar lumen. While calcium extrusion from the epithelial cells is well characterized, no calcium channel or transporter has been identified as the major conduit for calcium to enter the mammary epithelial cell from the bloodstream. A major aim of this thesis was to identify a calcium channel or channels responsible for calcium influx into mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate in vivo expression of calcium channels in the murine mammary gland at the four main stages of mammary gland development. The store-operated calcium channel Orai1 was upregulated during lactation relative to its expression in the nulliparous gland. The classic ORAI1 regulator Stim1 was not similarly overexpressed during lactation, however, its isoform Stim2 was modestly upregulated. HC11 murine mammary cells were used as a model to further investigate the role of STIM2 on calcium handling during lactation. siRNA knockdown of Stim2 reduced both basal and agonist-induced peak cytosolic calcium levels, indicative of its role in calcium regulation. In addition to investigating the role of calcium channels in normal mammary development, their role in breast cancer was examined. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to identify calcium channels upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines, relative to non-tumorigenic mammary cell lines. TRPV1, TRPV6, and ORAI1 were upregulated in the breast cancer cell lines. Pharmacological modulation of ORAI1 resulted in modest changes in proliferation, but as there was no specific ORAI1 inhibitor, this effect could not be conclusively attributed to ORAI1 inhibition. siRNA was used to specifically target ORAI1 in three human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T-47D. siRNA knockdown of ORAI1 was specific and potent, and reduced cell viability and altered calcium handing in all three cell lines. The alterations caused by ORAI1 knock down were not related to the expression of the genes CDK2 and FOS, as these did not change upon ORAI1 knockdown. Data mining was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#8217;s (NCBI&#8217;s) expressed sequence tag (EST) database, dbEST, and the Oncomine database. ORAI1 was elevated in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers and in the basal breast cancer molecular subtype, a subtype that has a poor prognosis.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discrete quadratic time-frequency distributions: Definition, computation, and a newborn electroencephalogram application</field><field name="creator">O' Toole, John</field><field name="description">Most signal processing methods were developed for continuous signals. Digital devices, such as the computer, process only discrete signals. This dissertation proposes new techniques to accurately define and efficiently implement an important signal processing method---the time--frequency distribution (TFD)---using discrete signals. The TFD represents a signal in the joint time--frequency domain. Because these distributions are a function of both time and frequency they, unlike traditional signal processing methods, can display frequency content that changes over time. TFDs have been used successfully in many signal processing applications as almost all real-world signals have time-varying frequency content. Although TFDs are well defined for continuous signals, defining and computing a TFD for discrete signals is problematic. This work overcomes these problems by making contributions to the definition, computation, and application of discrete TFDs. The first contribution is a new discrete definition of TFDs. A discrete TFD (DTFD) should be free from the sampling-related distortion known as aliasing and satisfy all the important mathematical properties that the continuous TFD satisfies. Many different DTFD definitions exist but none come close to attaining this ideal. I propose three new components which make up the DTFD: 1) a new discrete Wigner--Ville distribution (DWVD) definition which satisfies all properties, 2) a new discrete analytic signal which minimises aliasing in the DWVD, and 3) a new method to define and convolve the discrete kernel with the DWVD to produce the DTFD. The result: a DTFD definition that, relative to the existing definitions, better approximates the ideal DTFD. The second contribution is two sets of computationally efficient algorithms to compute the proposed DTFD. The first set of algorithms computes the DTFD exactly; the second set requires less memory than the first set by computing time- and, or frequency-decimated versions of the DTFD. Both sets of algorithms reduce the computational load by exploiting symmetries in the DTFD and by constructing kernel-specific algorithms for four different kernel types. The third, and final, contribution is a biomedical application for the proposed DTFD and algorithms. This application is to accurately detect seizure events in newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing detection methods do not perform well enough for use in a clinical setting. I propose a new method which is more robust than existing methods and show how using the proposed DTFD, comparative to an existing DTFD, improves detection performance for this method. In summary, this dissertation makes practical contributions to the area of time--frequency signal processing by proposing an improved DTFD definition, efficient DTFD algorithms, and an improved newborn EEG seizure detection method using DTFDs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">aliasing</field><field name="subject">analytic signal</field><field name="subject">computational complexity</field><field name="subject">discrete signal processing</field><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">time-frequency</field><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution (TFD)</field><field name="subject">Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bose-Einstein condensates in coupled co-planar double-ring traps : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masterate of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Tania J</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical study of Bose-Einstein condensates in a doublering trap. In particular, we determine the ground states of the condensate in the double-ring trap that arise from the interplay of quantum tunnelling and the trap&#8217;s rotation. The trap geometry is a concentric ring system, where the inner ring is of smaller radius than the outer ring and both lie in the same two-dimensional plane. Due to the difference in radii between the inner and outer rings, the angular momentum that minimises the kinetic energy of a condensate when confined in the individual rings is different at most frequencies. This preference is in direct competition with the tunnel coupling of the rings which favours the same angular momentum states being occupied in both rings. Our calculations show that at low tunnel coupling ground state solutions exist where the expectation value of angular momentum per atom in each ring differs by approximately an integer multiple. The energy of these solutions is minimised by maintaining a uniform phase difference around most of the ring, and introducing a Josephson vortex between the inner and outer rings. A Josephson vortex is identified by a 2p step in the relative phase between the two rings, and accounts for one quantum of circulation. We discuss similarities and differences between Josephson vortices in cold-atom systems and in superconducting Josephson junctions. Josephson vortices are actuated by a sudden change in the trapping potential. After this change Josephson vortices rotate around the double-ring system at a different frequency to the rotation of the double-ring potential. Numerical studies of the dependence of the velocity on the ground state tunnel coupling and interaction strength are presented. An analytical theory of the Josephson vortex dynamics is also presented which is consistent with our numerical results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Josephson vortex</field><field name="subject">tunnel coupling</field><field name="subject">superconductivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240200 Theoretical and Condensed Matter Physics::240203 Condensed matter physics-electronic and magnetic properties, superconductivity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/975</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk-based suveillance in animal health : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Prattley, Deborah Jayne</field><field name="description">Animal health surveillance is an important part of animal health care, particularly in countries dependent on livestock for food production and international trade. There are two major issues related to the provision of e&#174;ective surveillance activities. Firstly, for good information to become available, the design and conduct of data collection activ- ities should be carried out following sound statistical principles. In reality, constraints such as imperfect tests and unavoidably-biased sampling strategies hinder straightfor- ward analysis and interpretation of survey results. Risk-based surveillance is used to target high-risk sub-populations to increase e&#177;ciency of disease detection; however, biased datasets are generated. This thesis develops methodologies to design risk-based surveillance systems and al- low statistically valid analysis of the inherently biased data they generate. The &#175;rst example describes the development of a method to analyse surveillance data gathered for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The data are collected from four dif- ferent surveillance streams of animals tested for BSE, with each stream containing unavoidable biases and limitations. In the BSurvE model, these data are combined with demographic information for each birth cohort to estimate the proportion of each birth cohort infected with BSE. The prevalence of BSE in a national herd can then be estimated using the method of moments, whereby the observed number of infected animals is equated with the expected number. The upper 95% con&#175;dence limit for the prevalence is estimated both for infected countries and for those where no BSE has previously been detected. A similar approach to that used in BSurvE is then applied to surveillance data for trichinellosis, for which risk-based post-mortem testing is also performed. Negative results from multiple species using di&#174;erent, imperfect tests are combined to give an estimate of the upper 95% con&#175;dence limit of the national prevalence of trichinellosis in a reference population. This method is used to provide support for freedom from trichinellosis in Great Britain. A di&#174;erent approach to risk-based surveillance is explored as the surveillance strategy for detection of exotic causes of abortion in sheep and goats in New Zealand is examined. Using a geographic information system (GIS) maps of disease risk factors were overlain to produce a risk landscape for the lower North Island. This was used to demonstrate how areas of high- and low-risk of disease occurrence can be identi&#175;ed and used to guide the design of a risk-based surveillance programme. Secondly, within one surveillance objective there may be many ways in which the available funds or human resources could be distributed. This thesis develops a method to assess BSE surveillance programmes, and provides tools to facilitate BSE detection on the basis of infection risk and to increase the e&#177;ciency of surveillance strategies. A novel approach to allocation of resources is developed, where portfolio theory con- cepts from &#175;nance are applied to animal health surveillance. The example of surveil- lance for exotic causes of sheep and goat abortion is expanded upon. Risk of disease occurrence is assessed for a population over di&#174;erent time periods and geographical areas within a country, and portfolio theory used to allocate the number of tests to be carried out within each of these boundaries. This method is shown to be more likely to detect disease in a population when compared to proportional allocation of the available resources. The studies presented here show new approaches that allow better utilisation of imperfect data and more e&#177;cient use of available resources. They allow development of surveillance programmes containing an appropriate balance of scanning and targeted surveillance activities. Application of these methods will enhance the implementation and value of surveillance in animal health.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disease detection</field><field name="subject">BSE</field><field name="subject">trichinellosis</field><field name="subject">abortion</field><field name="subject">animal surveillance</field><field name="subject">animal health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1011</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into the meaning of Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts</field><field name="creator">Mace, Janet-Lee</field><field name="description">Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune syndrome characterized by a severe and rapid onset of paralysis that ascends without warning. It has an unknown aetiology and is generally unknown by most people, including medical professionals. When a person who has had GBS is asked to speak about their experience, they are likely to talk about aspects of it that are personally meaningful. Their account can be likened to a story in that it collates seemingly unconnected facts, episodes of activity and emotional attributions into a sequence that provides knowledge and understanding. A story is a powerful form for expressing suffering and experiences and so is particularly suitable for the study of trauma and illness. The actual process of creating the story, plus its presentational and organisational forms, provides sources for uncovering the identities authors choose to create and present of themselves. Six people who have had GBS were interviewed about their experience, and their stories were analysed using a narrative inquiry to discern the meanings attributed to GBS from the participants&#8217; own understandings and perspectives. The intended focus of the research was holistic and content based. The result of the narrative inquiry was a plot common to all six narratives. Namely, GBS is an inexplicable condition, during which horrendous things happen, but people do recover with time and it is likely their life view will be changed in the process. Four fundamental issues, identity, meaning, making sense and meaningfulness were drawn from the stories and configured into a narrative of the researcher&#8217;s making. What the participants chose to speak about became the meanings, or themes, major and minor, of their stories. No event has meaning in itself, however traumatic events can precipitate crises of meaning. When these crises are viewed within the context of other events, and are perceived to add value to life, then they have meaningfulness. In the telling of meanings and meaningfulness, the purpose for storying and the audience to whom the story is directed are the criteria for which the storylines are chosen. Both the story and the storying provide opportunities for the authors to create and offer images of themselves, that are then open to interpretation by an audience. As a traumatic experience, GBS enabled six people to tell their stories. In doing so they were able to make sense of important issues for themselves, and re-examine the way they saw themselves and the world.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paralysis</field><field name="subject">narratives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1180</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The platforms : an examination of New Zealand Special Air Service campaigns from Borneo 'confrontation' to the Vietnam War, 1965-1971 : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Defence and Strategic Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand EMBARGOED until 31 January 2012</field><field name="creator">Ball, Rhys</field><field name="description">In 1955, the New Zealand Government authorised the creation of a Special Forces unit to operate with British counterparts in Malaya to defeat a communist-inspired guerrilla insurgency. Between 1956 and 1971 elements of the New Zealand Special Air Service (SAS) were deployed on active service four times. These operational deployments included periods of time in Malaya, Thailand, Borneo and South Vietnam. The research illustrates the chronological progression of the New Zealand SAS through two of its most influential active service campaigns by examining how commitments to the Borneo &#8216;Confrontation&#8217; in 1965 and 1966 directly and indirectly influenced the deployment to South Vietnam between December 1968 and February 1971. The mission of the New Zealand SAS in South Vietnam was to &#8216;assist in providing long range reconnaissance patrols&#8217; that would support the larger infantry elements in defeating the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army enemy. New Zealand SAS soldiers participated in 169 Australian SAS patrols in South Vietnam. Of those, 137 were commanded by the New Zealanders themselves. The research describes what the New Zealand SAS encountered during nearly two and a half years in South Vietnam; from the tactical intensity associated with small five-man patrols often observing or contacting much larger enemy formations, to the uncompromising professional standards that were expected of all members regardless of situation or circumstances and the influences of experienced Patrol Commanders, and the frustrations and inflexibility which characterised the relationship with their Australian counterparts. The research also further examines the underlying issue of overall strategic success and value of a small nationally-identifiable and strongly independent military unit that was compelled to operate under the command of larger Special Forces coalition counterparts and the impact different political, doctrinal, tactical cultural and cognitive characteristics had on these joint-operational deployments. The size of the New Zealand SAS contribution to the Australian SAS Squadron combined with the command arrangements placed upon it, also dictated that the deployments were never likely to be able to exert influence in any &#8216;independent&#8217; or nationally-identifiable sense, and the relationships, the types of patrol operations conducted, and the value of these operations, would ultimately see many New Zealand SAS veterans largely dissatisfied with the overall performance of the deployment. Nevertheless, the strength of New Zealand SAS operations in South Vietnam came from its practical application of unique New Zealand Special Forces methodology and field-craft which had been fundamentally shaped and developed in Borneo. The New Zealand SAS operations in South Vietnam and Borneo - the demonstration of the highest standards of patrol techniques, tracking, reconnaissance, ambushing and fire discipline, and above all, operational professionalism that has been the hallmark of New Zealand's military history &#8211; provided the evolutionary &#8216;platforms&#8217; from which today&#8217;s highly skilled and enviable New Zealand Special Forces have emerged.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Special Air Service</field><field name="subject">New Zealand SAS</field><field name="subject">Malaya</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Borneo</field><field name="subject">South Vietnam</field><field name="subject">military history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360204 Defence studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economies of Tragedy</field><field name="creator">Sitchbury, Douglas</field><field name="description">This project investigates the formulation of tragedy over time, its traits and its uses.

Nevertheless, agricultural products accounted for over 60% of export earnings for both economies. This highlighted the importance that the agricultural sectors of Uruguay and New Zealand had to their respective foreign trade sectors. The success with which both countries&#8217; agricultural sectors solved their financial needs would be influential to their export sectors and overall economies. Through the use of expert interviews, a multiple-case study strategy was employed to carry out a comparative study of the agricultural financing systems of Uruguay and New Zealand. The findings revealed contrasting situations in both countries. Chief among them were the differences encountered in agricultural debt relative to agriculture&#8217;s contribution to total GDP in each country. In Uruguay this figure was 26% whereas in New Zealand it amounted to almost 400%. The differences found were largely attributable to the institutional frameworks in place in each country (i.e. the legal and cultural norms that structure political, social and economic interactions), as well as the historical contexts in which the institutions evolved. In Uruguay, the institutional framework limited producers&#8217; possibilities of accessing bank credit due to restrictive central bank regulations. The lack of access to international credit markets by Uruguayan banks due to the country&#8217;s unfavourable credit risk rating was an additional factor which limited credit availability. These were largely a result of the financial crisis (and the subsequent recession) that had occurred in the region in 2002. Producers in Uruguay were able to access costlier seasonal capital and some medium-term capital from informal lenders such as cooperatives, processors and input suppliers. Nevertheless, if they required medium and long term credit, Uruguayan farmers needed to deal with the banking system. Furthermore, the high cost of registering mortgages, combined with long-term loan facilities that generally did not go for longer than ten years, resulted in a limited demand for high-volume, long-term credit on producers&#8217; side. Almost the exact opposite situation was found in New Zealand. No great financial turmoil had affected New Zealand since the economic reforms of 1984, in which the economy in general was deregulated. An institutional framework which promoted access to credit, combined with a favourable country credit risk rating which promoted open access to overseas funding for banks, meant that the agricultural sector was able to expand its use of credit uninterruptedly since the early 1990s. Also, in contrast with the Uruguayan case, mortgaging of properties was relatively straightforward and inexpensive, and long term lending could be approved for terms of generally up to 20 years. These factors contributed to the expansion of rural credit in New Zealand. However, New Zealand&#8217;s agricultural debt was found to be greatly exposed to one subsector (the dairy farming sector). Moreover, the level of debt of New Zealand&#8217;s agricultural sector surpassed its contribution to GDP many times over, which raised doubts concerning the long-term sustainability of that level of debt.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uruguay agriculture</field><field name="subject">New Zealand agriculture</field><field name="subject">agricultural credit</field><field name="subject">agricultural finance</field><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="subject">institutional framework</field><field name="subject">agency theory</field><field name="subject">150203 - Financial Institutions (incl.

In the thesis, consideration has been given to economic, social and environmental parameters which selection and factors influencing have been ranked accordingly.  This study uses quantitative study similar to what was employed in previous researches.  A self-administered survey questionnaire to 320 respondents in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was held in October 2007 which 301 respondents returned the survey with a response rate of 89 percent.  In this study, the results were presented from mean analysis, indepedent t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis.  The study presents interesting findings on Al-Bay Bithaman Ajil (BBA) concept of home loan financing to the alternative Musharakah Mutanaqisah (MM) home loan financing, which MM home loan financing has more benefit than BBA home loan financing.  Currently, only BBA home loan financing has been widely used within bank and/or financial institutions in Malaysia.  The study also indicated that despite of religion or race, every respondent has their own view provided they were given sufficient information and/or know of the Islamic home loan financing.  The logit model developed in this study identified "education" and "sources of Islamic home loan financing" as having an influence on purchasing home behavior with "home cost" variable taken into account.  Hitherto with Bumiputra privileges and certain pro-Bumiputra policies in Malaysia, Malays community has more opportunities than non-Malays community in buying homes due to Bumiputra Laws which have been established in the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) since 1971.  The NEP adopts the goal of poverty eradication and economic restructuring so as to eliminate the identification of ethnicity with economic function.  Bumiputra privileges and quotas are based on Article 153 of the Constitution that provided special rights for the Malays.  With all privileges given by the Government abovementioned, it may affect the socio-economic characteristics which influence to the decision to purchase a home.  Nevertheless, regardless of ethnicity or religion, Islamic banks have greater social and moral responsibility to ensure that their principles of financing are fair to everyone.  The Malaysian Islamic financial sector is seen as one of the most progressive and atrractive in the world given the numerous incentives planned and further liberation in the coming years.  Malaysia has a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework that caters to the unique charactertics of Islamic finance with the strong financial standards, such as that corporate governance, transparency, disclosure, accountability, market discipline, risk management and customer protection.  With these elements, new attractive schemes can be developed to meet Malaysian bank customers' needs.

The central premise of this thesis is that interpersonal influence may complement the mass media approach to mammography promotion, and serve to increase the national screening rate. In particular, in light of previous research that has identified the family has as a potential vehicle for delivering health promotion messages, the potential role that a daughter could play in influencing her mother&#8217;s health behaviour was given particular attention in the current project. Everyday interpersonal communication initiated by the daughter directed at the mother is referred to as &#8216;upward family communication&#8217; in this thesis. Upward family communication about mammography is a novel approach to mammography promotion, and the purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to explore the viability of this strategy.  Family Communication Patterns theory describes four family types based on two dimensions: the conversation orientation and the conformity orientation. This theoretical framework is used in the current project to inform predictions about upward family communication about mammography, particularly in relation to identifying which mother-daughter dyads are likely to engage in such communication effectively. The Revised Family Communication Patterns (RFCP) instrument, used to classify families according to type, was modified as part of the current project for use specifically with mother-daughter dyads. Tailoring the instrument for use specifically with mother-daughter dyads has not previously been attempted, and the data from this project indicate that the internal consistency of the instrument was not compromised in this process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight mother-daughter pairs to explore the nature of existing communication patterns within this relationship, and the modified RFCP instrument was able to differentiate between mother-daughter dyads with different communication patterns. The data from these interviews indicate that while upward family communication about health is commonplace within these dyads, mammography is not likely to be a spontaneous topic of conversation initiated by daughters.  Thus, two daughter-targeted interventions were piloted that aimed to predict and facilitate upward family communication about mammography. With the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) providing the theoretical background, a volitional intervention using implementation intentions and a motivational intervention using counterfactual thinking were piloted with independent samples. These studies represent the first attempts at using the TPB to predict and facilitate upward family communication about mammography and at applying implementation intentions and counterfactual thinking to this communication behaviour. Young women who participated in the implementation intention (volitional) intervention were significantly more likely to have initiated a conversation with their mothers about mammography within an eight-week period than controls (N = 116). In contrast, young women who participated in the counterfactual thinking (motivational) intervention were no more likely to have initiated the specified conversation than controls (N = 131). In both studies, the TPB variables predicted both intention and behaviour with some accuracy, thus contributing to the body of knowledge about the utility of this theoretical model. Notably, in both studies, young women reported that initiating a conversation about mammography with their mother had positive consequences, such as increases in knowledge, and an elevated likelihood that their mother would have a mammogram. This result provided evidence for daughters&#8217; willingness to engage in an upward family communication mammography promotion strategy, and for the effectiveness of this novel approach. The primary contribution of the project presented in this thesis is the provision of convergent evidence for the viability and effectiveness of an upward family communication strategy to promote mammography to target women. The current project has also presented a means for identifying mother-daughter dyads most amenable to this novel mammography promotion approach using the predictions of Family Communication Patterns Theory. Further, the results of this project have demonstrated that the TPB model has utility for predicting upward family communication about mammography, and has potential for guiding interventions aimed at facilitating this behaviour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3096</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytic solutions for linear waves propagating in an ocean with variable bottom topography and their applications in renewable wave energy</field><field name="creator">Harun, Fatimah Noor</field><field name="description">Studies about ocean waves have been evolving over a period of time. Re&#172;cently, there has been renewed interest in problems of refraction, di&#64256;raction and radiation of ocean waves around structures. In this thesis, the analytic solutions for linear waves propagating in an ocean with variable bottom to&#172;pography and their applications in renewable wave energy are presented. In the &#64257;rst part, we present an analytic solution to the shallow water wave equa&#172;tion for long waves propagating over a circular hump. As a useful tool in coastal engineering, the solution may be used to study the refraction of long waves around a circular hump. It may also be used as a validation tool for any numerical model developed for coastal wave refraction. To validate the new analytic solution, we have compared our new analytical solution with a numerical solution obtained by using the &#64257;nite di&#64256;erence method. The agreement between these two solutions is excellent. By using the analytic solution, the e&#64256;ect of the hump dimensions on wave refraction over the circular hump are examined. In the second part of this thesis, based on the mild-slope equation derived by Smith and Sprinks [1] and the extended refraction-di&#64256;raction equation developed by Massel [2], we have constructed a two-layer mild-slope equation for interfacial waves propagating on the interface of a two-layer ocean model. First, we follow Smith and Sprinks&#8217;s [1] approach to derive the mild-slope equation for the propagation of interfacial waves, with the higher-order terms proportional to the bottom slope and bottom curvature all being neglected. We then derived the extended version of the mild-slope equation with the higher-order terms included. While we were able to solve the &#64257;rst equation analytically, we presented a numerical solution for the second equation. As a part of the veri&#64257;cation process, both solutions were compared with each other and also with the single-layer mild-slope equation when the density of the upper layer goes to zero. We then used the new solution to study the e&#64256;ect of the hump dimensions on the refraction of the interfacial waves over a circular hump. Finally, in the &#64257;nal section of this thesis, we have used what we have developed before to construct the two-layer mild-slope equation with free surface on top. By utilizing this equation, we then derived an analytic solu&#172;tion for long waves propagating over a circular hump with a hollow circular cylinder &#64258;oating in the free surface. In order to validate our new analytic solution, we have compared our problem with Mac Camy and Fuchs [3] solu&#172;tion, because our solution has reduced to their solution when the lower water depth, h2, goes to zero. We have also compared our solution with the &#64258;at bottom case in order to further veri&#64257;ed our solution. Finally, by using the new solution, both di&#64256;raction and refraction e&#64256;ects from the hollow cylinder and hump dimensions are examined and discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CFD modelling and analysis of an opposed piston internal combustion engine</field><field name="creator">Thomas, George</field><field name="description">A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of an opposed piston Internal Combustion (IC) engine, also known as the NuStroke engine, has been developed. The thesis focuses on the design and analysis of this particular engine using ANSYS CFX, a commercial CFD tool. The primary objectives of this thesis are to analyse the gas flow, effect of heat transfer, and combustion process on the engine performance. The engine geometry is modelled and meshed in ANSYS Workbench V11.0 to minimize any exporting errors that may creep in and cause serious mesh issues during mesh deformation simulation. Several researchers for a wide range of cases, justifying its application in the present study, have extensively validated different versions of the CFD code.At the initial stage of the project, the engine is modelled with single inlet and exhaust ports, the piston motion is prescribed with a sinusoidal profile, and a polynomial profile based on cam profile motion. The model does not include the combustion process. It is validated against an air-standard cycle process model developed in spreadsheet form. Similar spreadsheet models have been developed and extensively validated against experimental results of other engines by the author as a part of another thesis. To analyse the effects of combustion, the Domain Source Method (DSM) is employed in the CFD model, by which energy of combustion is explicitly fed to the engine model.A further improved CFD model with multiple inlet and exhaust ports is then applied. This enables the engine CFD model to closely simulate a real world engine, with the combustion model based on the DSM. The results obtained are then compared with the previous modelling results and spreadsheet results. The initial work on using Burning Velocity Model (BVM) and Eddy Dissipation Model/Finite Rate Chemistry (EDM/FRC) models to simulate combustion in the model is done and some results from these models are presented. The in-cylinder flow fields and pressure waves observed show significant vortex generation and heat transfer through the gas and combustion chamber walls. The present modelling of the engine using CFD techniques, and the analysis are the first attempts of this kind for this particular engine. The advantage of polynomial cam profile in controlling the performance of this engine is observed to be outstanding. The analysis of the obtained pressure and temperature, and the incylinder mid-plane pressure and velocity streamline plots show that both the spreadsheet model and CFD model agree qualitatively. These observations lead to a conclusion that the project, if extended further with experimental analysis, will give results that are comparable to the spreadsheet and CFD model results.The current work successfully presents a numerical simulation of an opposed piston engine. This study has enough potential to boost further research attempts in similar engine configurations, as the opposed piston engines have not been widely used nowadays in industries due to difficulties in attaining a successful design and balancing issues despite of the fact that they are low cost and less complicated engines. At this stage of the thesis, experimental results are not available for a more extensive validation, but at a later stage, if possible, this could be done to validate the current CFD model. Further extensive research on similar engine configurations with the help of good computing facilities and CFD simulation tools would make it possible to develop a successful, designer-friendly, and eco-friendly engine, which could eventually set up a new revolution in the entire engine industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3098</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge and knowers in online learning : investigating the effects of online flexible learning on student sojourners</field><field name="creator">Chen, Rainbow Tsai-Hung</field><field name="description">This study investigates the effects of online flexible learning on international students in Australian higher education. It brings together two issues widely viewed as key to the future of higher education worldwide: online learning and international students. The focus of this research is on Chinese students because they are presently among the largest international student cohorts in English-speaking countries that have embraced online education, including Australia. The study was motivated by the paucity of empirical research on international students&#8217; experiences of online flexible learning, and particularly the lack of research in this area underpinned by theory. The aim of this investigation was to explore Chinese international students&#8217; perspectives and experiences of online flexible learning by systemically analysing these learners&#8217; educational dispositions, the pedagogic practices involved in this form of learning, and the relations between these two factors. The study seeks to generate findings that contribute to the theorisation of online educational experiences.The research employed a qualitative case study approach, drawing on postgraduate Chinese students&#8217; online experiences in the Faculty of Education at an Australian university. Three key questions guided the research: (1) What are the characteristics of the teaching practices that have helped shape the educational beliefs and values that Chinese student sojourners bring to the online learning context in Australia? (2) What are the characteristics of the online teaching practices at the Australian university, including the pedagogical beliefs underpinning them? (3) How do Chinese students interpret and respond to these online teaching practices? The research design comprised three main parts that addressed these three questions respectively. These involved conducting: focus groups with Chinese students from various faculties; interviews with Australian teachers of online units in the Faculty of Education, and a review of their unit outlines; and multi-session interviews with individual Chinese students who had previously been or were currently enrolled in an online unit in the Faculty of Education.The theoretical framework used for the research drew primarily on three principal sources. First, Berry&#8217;s acculturation approach (1980, 1997a, 2005) provided an organising framework for analytically distinguishing what the &#8216;heritage culture&#8217; or dispositions students brought with them from China, the &#8216;host culture&#8217; or pedagogic practices they encountered in Australian online courses, and the outcomes of the meeting of these two educational cultures. Secondly, the conceptual framework of Basil Bernstein (1977, 1990, 2000) enabled each of these to be analysed in terms of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment.  Thirdly, Maton&#8217;s &#8216;Legitimation Code Theory&#8217; (LCT) (Maton, 2000, 2007, 2009; Moore &amp; Maton, 2001) provided a further means of conceptualising their underlying structuring principles in a manner that enabled a systematic analysis. The instructional approaches used in the online units examined in this research were identified as constructivist-inspired. A major finding of the study was that there was, in the terms of legitimation codes, a &#8216;code clash&#8217; between the students&#8217; prior &#8216;knowledge code&#8217; educational experiences (where explicit procedures, skills and specialised knowledge are emphasised) and the teachers&#8217; &#8216;knower code&#8217; notions of education (where learners&#8217; dispositions are emphasised as the basis of achievement). This code clash in the students&#8217; online learning experiences led to &#8216;relativist code&#8217; consequences (where neither specialist knowledge nor particular dispositions is emphasised &#8211; a kind of vacuum of legitimacy), which were associated with feelings of isolation, guilt and depression. The study argues that online constructivist teaching assumes a particular kind of knower, with particular socially-based dispositions and experiences, and systematically disadvantages other kinds of knowers. The thesis concludes with a detailed theoretical explanation for this form of learning experience, and a discussion of the findings in relation to constructivist teaching practice and online learning.One contribution of the study is that it expands the knowledge base concerning Chinese learners&#8217; experiences with online flexible education. More prominent and enduring contributions of this research, however, reside in the wider application of the findings to other learner populations, and in the demonstrated utility of exploring online educational practice and experience through a sociology of knowledge approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3099</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology and the Australian state: the changing political discourse on technology in Australia 1975-1985</field><field name="creator">Couchman, Paul K.</field><field name="description">The thesis brings contemporary social theory into the analysis of science and technology policy. In doing so it draws on two broad areas of theory, on the social nature of technology and on the state as an institution of political domination. Technology is important to the state for it provides new means for state actors to achieve desired ends (state actors thus have an instrumental interest in technology), and it sets an agenda of policy problems for the state to deal with. Conversely, the state is important to technology for it is a major orienting agent and an organisational locus for much technological development.The thesis advances a number of central theoretical themes on technology and the state. While technology is a social construction, the product of deliberate choices and actions by particular social actors, it is also socially structuring in that technologies are ways of building order in the world and can therefore have political properties. Technologies embody the values and interests of those groups informing their development, so inherent in any new technology there is a potential for conflict between those responsible for it and those affected by its social implementation. The state is an independent political actor which has its own power base and which can mobilise its own administrative, coercive and ideological resources. However, the state in capitalist society has to act within a national and international context which both constrains and influences its capacity to exercise its power. The societal context enmeshes the state in contradictions, and in seeking to resolve these, foster consensus and mobilise acceptance of their policies, state actors deploy ideology, political language and symbolic action as political resources. Drawing on this theoretical framework, the thesis analyses the changing political discourse on technology in Australia from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's. During this period, against a background context of growing economic crisis, there arose a technological change debate in which a "technology as threat" perspective prevailed. The central themes in this were that the rate of technological change was increasing and was moving beyond human control, and consequently the associated social dislocations (particularly the prospect of widespread "technological unemployment") were becoming a major problem. What was sought by many groups was some form of centralised control over technological change to ensure that the costs and benefits were equitably distributed. This perspective, and the demands arising from it, presented a challenge to the economic order, its decision-making structures and the ideologies that legitimated them. Governments within the Australian state responded to these challenges, and two such responses are analyzed in the thesis: the Fraser Government's Myers Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia and the New South Wales Technology Research Unit. Both embodied the concept of technology assessment, but in different forms. These responses were important symbolic actions, for they not only provided symbolic reassurance through the propagation of a rhetoric of control (technology can be managed to the benefit of all) and a legitimation of the order by reasserting the ideology of technological progress, they also were attempts to contain subordinate group pressures. Such actions went some way to rehabilitating technology in the political discourse, and they marked the beginning of the end of the technology as threat perspective therein. Another aspect of the political rehabilitation of technological change was the promotion of the strategic economic importance of technology through the rhetoric of "technology as opportunity". Through this state actors have sought to gain the positive acceptance of the technological order and a consensus on the desirability of new technology. In order to mobilise consent, the rhetoric of technology as opportunity has been embedded in a language of crisis ("there is no alternative"), strategies to improve the public image of science and technology have been deployed, and the concerns about the social implications of technological change have been displaced from the policy arena. These activities have been most successful under the auspices of the Hawke Labor Government's "Accord". In a context of "cooperation among social partners", a policy of public support for private  technology has been implemented, consensus maintained and dissent contained. If in the technological change debate, technology had been politicised, in a political climate where technology as opportunity dominated, technology had become depoliticised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2112</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting milk protein concentration and composition of dairy cattle in the sub-tropical regions of northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">David Graham BARBER</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151571</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cryopreservation for germplasm conservation of coconut (Cocos nucifera L)</field><field name="creator">Sisunandar</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:152755</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrelationships between metabolic status and the onset of ovulation a puberty and postpartum in beef cattle</field><field name="creator">Dr Firooz Samadi</field><field name="description">Nutrition is known to have an important bearing on reproductive function in female cattle. Major reproductive events that are influenced by nutrition include the onset of ovulation at puberty and the resumption of ovulation postpartum. Although the impact of nutrition on reproduction in female cattle is generally recognised, information is lacking on details of the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function. This applies in particular to beef cattle maintained on subtropical pastures. The primary aim in the present thesis was to characterise the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function in Zebu (Brahman, Bos indicus) and Zebu crossbred (Droughtmaster, Brahman x Shorthorn (Bos taurs)) beef cattle in relation to the onset of ovulation at puberty (Brahman) and resumption of ovulation postpartum (Droughtmaster). In the first major study, pre-pubertal Brahman heifers were assigned to either moderate nutrition (MN, n = 11)) or improved nutrition (IN, n = 11). Supplementation with cottonseed meal and steamed flaked barley was used to ensure differences in live weight gain and body condition score (BCS) between heifers on MN and IN. Heifers were monitored at 2-week intervals for body weight, BCS and circulating concentrations of GH, IGF-1, leptin, insulin and glucose. Ovarian follicular status was recorded by ultrasonography at the same time. Liver biopsies were obtained at 8-10 weeks intervals. Faecal samples were collected at the time of liver biopsies to ascertain dietary crud protein (CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD). Pastures were sampled on six occasions at approximately 8-10 weeks intervals to determine trace mineral content. The trace minerals of particular interest were copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). Heifers on IN had greater (P &lt; 0.01) dietary CP and DMD than heifers on MN. Pasture analyses showed no differences (P &gt; 0.05) between the IN and MN for trace minerals. The analysis of liver concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn indicated that there was no difference (P &gt; 0.5) between heifers on MN and IN. Heifers on IN had greater (P &lt; 0.01) circulating concentrations of metabolic regulators (IGF-1, insulin, leptin) than heifers on MN for the period 11 months to 23 months of age. However, there were no outstanding differences in metabolic regulators between heifers on MN and IN at single time points from 11 to 23 months. The diameter of the largest follicles did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) between the heifers on IN and heifers on MN. All heifers on IN had attained puberty by 23 months of age whilst only one heifer on MN had reached puberty at the same time. Puberty in heifers on IN appeared to be influenced, in part, by increasing day length as the majority of heifers attained puberty over a 3-month period between 21 and 23 months of age which coincided with the winter-to-spring transition. It was concluded from the findings that heifers on IN had a generally improved metabolic homeostasis which was linked with greater body weight and body condition, and this induced an earlier attainment of puberty. In the second major study, Droughtmaster cows were assigned to moderate pasture (MP, n = 7) or improved pasture (IP, n = 7) from 6 to 7 months of gestation until 6 months after calving. Starting at 1 week after calving, cows were monitored for body weight and body condition at 2-week intervals. Circulating concentrations of metabolic regulators (GH, IGF-1, leptin, insulin and glucose) were monitored weekly and ovarian follicular function was recorded at the same time by rectal ultrasonography. Faecal samples were collected at 3-week intervals to determined dietary CP and DMD. Pastures were sampled on four occasions at 5-weeks intervals to ascertain trace mineral status. Cows underwent liver biopsies at 3-week intervals during the postpartum period to determine the liver concentrations of trace elements (Cu, Mn and Zn) and to evaluate gene expression. Cows on IP had greater (P &lt;0.01) dietary CP and DMD than cows on MP. There were no differences (P &gt; 0.05) for liver concentrations of Mn and Zn between cows on MP and IP, but the latter cows had greater (P &lt; 0.01) liver concentrations of Cu at 1 week after calving and throughout postpartum. Cows on IP were heavier (P &lt; 0.01) and had a greater (P &lt; 0.01) body condition at 1 week after calving and throughout postpartum than cows on MP. Cows on IP had greater (P &lt; 0.01) circulating concentrations of IGF-1, insulin, leptin and glucose than cows on MP. The size of the largest follicles did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) between the cows on IP compared with cows on MP. All cows on IP had resumed ovulation by Week 16 postpartum whereas only 1 of 7 cows on MP had shown ovulation by Week 19 (P &lt; 0.01). It was concluded from the findings that cows on IP had a significantly improved metabolic homeostasis than cows on MP and that this induced an earlier resumption of ovulation postpartum. This is the first study to demonstrate long- term differences in metabolic homeostasis achieved by pasture-based nutritional management in postpartum beef cows. The most notable feature of liver gene expression was an apparent greater expression of genes linked with fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and IGF-1 at Week 6 postpartum for cows on IP compared with cows on MP. It is not known how an apparent increase in expression of these genes at Week 6 postpartum might be temporally related to the resumption of ovulation between Weeks 11 and 16 for cows on IP. The above reseach has provided important new information on the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and reproductive function in Zebu and Zebu crossbred pubertal heifers and postpartum cows. Lont-term nutritional management can be used to achieve differences in metabolic homeostasis that are related to the initiation of ovulation at puberty and resumption of ovulation postpartum. Differences in circulating concentrations of IGf-1, leptin, insulin and glucose that are linked to the initiation (puberty) and resumption (postpartum) of ovulation could be interpreted to suggest that these metabolic indicators act at both the brain and somatic tissues to influence reproduction in female cattle. Potential actions of metabolic indicators at the brain to influence reproduction are particularly intriguing given the presence of specific receptors for IGF-1 on GnRH neurons and leptin on KISS-1 neurons within the hypothalamus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:155388</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comparative ecology and population dynamics of koalas in the koala coast region of south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jim, (James Athol)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0501 Ecological Applications</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Ecology -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Habitat -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158282</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Population Ecology of Manta Birostris in Southern Mozambique</field><field name="creator">Andrea Denise Marshall</field><field name="description">Despite being the world&#8217;s largest batoid fish, manta rays have been the focus of very little research in the last century. Almost nothing is currently known about their ecology or distribution throughout the world&#8217;s oceans. Manta rays are considered to be near-threatened to vulnerable by the World Conservation Union&#8217;s Redlist of endangered species, yet many populations still face threats from target fishing for their fin cartilage, branchial filaments and meat. The taxonomic history of the genus Manta has been questionable and convoluted,with Manta having one of the most extensive generic and species synonymies of any living genus of cartilaginous fish. Currently this genus is considered to be monotypicwith a single recognized species, Manta birostris. Behavioural and morphological data collected during this study showed that there are two distinct, sympatric species of manta ray in Mozambique. This discovery has led to an examination of manta ray distribution worldwide, with the two species hypothesis receiving further support from study sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This thesis examined large populations of both putative species in Mozambique. Development and application of a photographic-identification methodology allowed identification of individuals based on their unique ventral surface markings (spots). The ability to recognise individuals enabled many aspects of both populations to be examined. A total of 449 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant A and 101 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant B. Both populations exhibited a highly significant female bias in observed sex ratios of 1:3.5 and 1:7.4 respectively. The photographic identification approach was used in studies of population size and structure and to examine the reproductive ecology of these two distinct populations. Population estimates incorporating four years of re-sighting data on Manta birostris variant A and five years of data on Manta birostris variant B were conducted using the program MARK resulting in super population estimates of 890 and 600 individuals respectively. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for Manta birostris variant A based on observations of mating events and fresh pectoral fin tip scars on female rays produced when the male rays bite onto the fins during copulation. The distribution of scars was highly biased, with 99% on the left pectoral fin, indicative of a strong lateralised behavioural trait in this species. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralisation. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals giving birth in the summer after a gestation period of approximately one year. Reproductive periodicity in M. birostris variant A was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were seen to be pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed in fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Morphometric analysis of late-term foetus (M. birostris variant A) was contrasted with measurements taken from adult rays. These are the only detailed measurements on M. birostris variant A from the western Indian Ocean. Predatory scarring and bite injuries on individuals of both variant A and B were consistent with attacks from sharks of various sizes. The frequency and effect of these predatory injuries on the two populations were examined over a three-year period. Acoustic tags were attached to fourteen rays and their presence/absence at sites around the major inshore reefs was explored to evaluate how the rays utilised their environment on a temporal scale. Cleaning activity of both putative species of manta rays by small fishes occurred on these reefs and was considered to be the main reason why the rays were present at these sites. Parasite removal and wound healing were implicated as the benefits received. Host cleaner fish species partition the manta ray body to avoid interspecific competition while the two putative species appear to partition cleaning habitats, with very little overlap apparent. This research on manta rays is the first of its kind in African waters. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this genus. The study additionally provided sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the separation of these two putative species of Manta and a full revision of the genus with the systematic examination of specimens throughout Manta&#8217;s range. The results of this study may be useful in this endeavour as diagnostic characteristics have been isolated that may help to differentiate members of this genus. The results of this research study are directly applicable to management strategies for both putative species of manta rays off the East Coast of Africa as well as populations worldwide and have highlighted the potential need for different conservation strategies</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elasmobranch, Manta ray, Population biology, Taxonomy, Morphology, Reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160974</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactivity Grafting of Cyclic Peptides: Structure Activity Studies of Grafted Cyclotides and SFTI-1</field><field name="creator">Sunithi Gunasekera</field><field name="description">Peptides are considered as drugs of the future because of their advantageous features of high specificity and low toxicity. However, the complete therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized because of the in vivo instability displayed by most potential peptides. In this thesis, two naturally derived cyclic peptides, cyclotides and sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1), were utilized to impart stability to linear bioactive epitopes and enhance their therapeutic potential in a biological environment. Cyclotides are plant derived mini-proteins with compact folded structures and exceptional stability. Their stability derives from a head-to-tail cyclised backbone coupled with a cystine knot arrangement of three-conserved disulfide bonds. Sunflower typsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) is a stable cyclic peptide containing a single disulfide bond. Taking advantage of these stable cyclic peptide frameworks, novel drug leads to inhibit/stimulate angiogenesis were developed by using the approach of &#8216;epitope grafting&#8217; in which linear epitopes were grafted onto the cyclic peptide frameworks. Angiogenesis is a physiological condition that is unregulated in the progression of many diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Thus the drug leads designed in the current project have potential therapeutic applications to combat cancers and cardiovascular diseases. To fully exploit cyclotides as drug scaffolds, it is imperative to understand their folding. Two main subfamilies, referred to as the M&#246;bius and bracelet cyclotides have been identified and interestingly, they require dramatically different in vitro folding conditions to achieve formation of the conserved cyclic cystine knot motif. To determine the underlying structural elements that influence cyclotide folding, the in vitro folding of a suite of hybrid cyclotides based on combination of the M&#246;bius cyclotide kalata B1 and the bracelet cyclotide cycloviolacin O1 was examined in this thesis. The pathways of folding of the two cyclotide subfamilies were found to be different and primarily dictated by specific residues harboured within inter-cysteine loops 2 and 6. Two changes in these loops, an amino acid substitution in loop 2 and an amino acid addition in loop 6 enabled the folding of cycloviolacin O1 under conditions where folding does not occur in vitro for the native peptide. Thus, the study identified key residues that are not in close proximity in the primary sequence or three-dimensional structure which assist folding in cyclotides. A key intermediate species in the folding pathway was isolated and characterised, and found to contain a native-like hairpin structure that appears to be a nucleation locus early in the folding process. The intermediate does not have native disulfide connectivities, but disulfide shuffling processes ultimately lead to a rearrangement to the native form. Overall these mechanistic findings on the folding of cyclotides are potentially valuable for protein engineering applications that utilize cystine-rich peptides as scaffolds in the design of new drug leads. The current study has also enabled the extention of the grafting studies to the bracelet cyclotide subfamily, which was intractable to grafting prior to this work. Cyclotides are gene encoded macrocyclic proteins and another way to exploit their potential as drug scaffolds, would be to develop combinatorial cyclotide libraries. The most efficient way to generate engineered cyclotides would be via recombinant expression, which currently remains unsuccessful, partly due to lack of understanding of the mechanism of cyclotide backbone cyclization. Understanding how the cyclotide precursor folds may provide clues to how cyliclization occurs. A conserved region known as the N-terminal repeat (NTR) region in the cyclotide precursor has been speculated to play an important role in precursor folding. In this thesis, the function of the NTR in the folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro was examined via the design of a series of constructs for the precursor protein for the prototypic kalata B1 cyclotide, with incremental additions of the NTR region. Analysis of the constructs by NMR spectroscopy for evidence of secondary structure revealed that the NTR does not assist folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro. Using diffusion NMR, the unstructured nature of the constructs was localized to the NTR region. In a complementary study, structural analysis of the full length cyclotide precursor was carried out by expressing the precursor gene for kalata B1 in a bacterial expression system. The full-length precursor was found to be unstructured in solution despite approximately half of the precursor comprising the mature domain and NTR, both of which are structured in isolation. The unstructured nature of the cyclotide precursor suggested that a different environment, or indeed interaction of the NTR with a particular enzyme involved in processing, is necessary for it to adopt a well-defined conformation and allow processing to produce the mature circular protein. The information that NTR alone may not assist folding of the cyclotide precursors has provided new impetus to examine the role of other potential folding auxiliaries such as protein disulfide isomerase in cyclotide folding and has indirectly advanced the production of cyclotides via transgenic means. In summary, this thesis has provided a fundamental insight into the folding of cyclotides, both when expressed as part of a precursor protein and in isolation via solid phase chemical synthesis, and has exploited the potential of cyclic peptide scaffolds in drug design applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cyclotides</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">Grafting</field><field name="subject">Peptides</field><field name="subject">Drug design</field><field name="subject">Folding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165426</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Fucoidin efficacy in A&#946;-peptide induced Alzheimer&#8217;s disease rodent model</field><field name="creator">Aarti Patel</field><field name="description">Abstract Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a major public health concern worldwide, with an increasing prevalence in the elderly population. AD is a progressive neurological disorder of multi-faceted origin, where factors such as genetic mutations, biochemical changes, along with inflammatory cascade and soluble beta amyloid (A&#946;) peptide, are thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic failure and neuronal death, ultimately leading to cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline in patients suffering from the disease. At present, there is no long-term cure for the disease, although there is access to pharmacotherapy that might improve cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms early in the course of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy for AD only provides symptomatic relief for a very short period of time. It is therefore of utmost importance to discover other pharmacological strategies that might delay the development of AD and slow down the disease progression in terms of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in AD neuropathogenesis is a major goal to find efficacious disease-modifying treatments. What remains to be understood completely are the intracellular pathways affected by A&#946; protein which may lead to neurodegeneration in AD. Since phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms are crucial in the &#946;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, protein kinase C has emerged as one of the key regulators of the APP metabolism. Indeed, dysregulation of the PKC pathway might play a role in the intracellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration, but their effective involvement still remains elusive. Therefore, a detailed analysis of PKC pathways in established models of AD neurodegeneration is necessary and will form part of this work. Fucoidin is a sulphated polysaccharide extracted from edible brown seaweed, which has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as being a neuroprotectant in various inflammatory diseases including hypoxic ischemia, atherosclerosis and Heyman nephritis. Therefore, fucoidin may have an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory mechanisms of AD. Little is known, however, about the effect of fucoidin on AD. Animal models of AD are extremely valuable for the discovery and development of new treatments. Rodents have been one of the preferred models for pharmacological and behavioural studies in AD. In this thesis, first aim was to establish a non-transgenic A&#946;-induced AD model in rats. AD was induced utilising a published protocol which involved the bilateral injection of aggregated A&#946; (1-42) into the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in rat brain. Behavioural assessment with well defined tools such as the Morris water maze and T-maze were utilised to assess the impairment in spatial working memory in rats. Behavioural impairments along with increased astrocytosis and microgliosis were observed in this particular A&#946;-induced AD model. In the established disease model, fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day) and ibuprofen (50 mg/kg/day) were shown to provide a partial protective effect on impairment in memory function in the MWM behavioural task in rats treated prior to disease initiation and throughout the course of the study. In addition, the histopathological and quantitative analysis of AD brain sections showed a marked reduction in reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglia in fucoidin (low and high dose) and ibuprofen treated A&#946; injected rats compared to untreated A&#946; injected rats. These results indicate that fucoidin may serve as a possible effective therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. There is strong evidence that PKC &#945; and &#949; signalling pathways regulate important molecular events in memory impairment and neurodegenerative pathophysiology in AD. A possible neuroprotective mechanism of fucoidin involving attenuation of an A&#946;-induced decrease in PKC &#949; phosphorylation using cultured SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells as a model system was examined. Co-administration of fucoidin (2&#956;M and 5 &#956;M) with A&#946; (1&#956;M) abolished the inhibitory effect of A&#946; on the phosphorylation of PKC&#949; in a concentration-dependent manner as revealed by western blot analysis. These findings suggest that a possible mechanism underpinning the neuroprotective effect of fucoidin may be through prevention of A&#61538;-induced inhibition of PKC phosphorylation and may serve as a possible therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. As cellular events that involve PKC are affected by A&#946; in in vitro systems, it was necessary to examine whether PKC activity is also modulated by the A&#946; treatment in vivo in our A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Therefore, the next aim was to assess the potential for fucoidin use as an intervention therapy in an established disease stage in the A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Intervention with fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in the established disease stage partially prevented A&#946; (1-42) mediated damage with respect to memory impairment, neuroinflammation and PKC &#949; phosphorylation in the in vivo AD model consistent with the in vitro findings in SHSY5Y cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer Disease, amyloid beta peptide, fucoidin, PKC</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177944</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial Aggregation and Biofilm Formation by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">Yanwen Cheryl-lynn Ong</field><field name="description">Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common nosocomial infections and is caused by a range of different uropathogens, particularly by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Amongst the different virulence factors, biofilm formation and bacterial aggregation, often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae, are common traits among uropathogens that cause CAUTI. In this study, a collection of UPEC isolates were screened for virulence genes and phenotypes associated with urinary tract infections such as biofilm formation and mannose-sensitive haemagglutination. Two strains, E. coli MS2027 (which formed a strong biofilm) and E. coli M184 (which aggregated strongly) were analysed in detail to determine the molecular mechanisms associated with these phenotypes. Transposon mutagenesis of E. coli MS2027 identified type 3 fimbriae as the factor responsible for its strong biofilm growth. Further screening revealed the presence of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other E. coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial (mrkABCD) genes from these strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (A-E) ranging from one to twenty-three members. The majority of the sequences grouped in clade A, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced K. pneumoniae strain MGH78578. We demonstrated that type 3 fimbriae are functionally expressed by different Gram negative nosocomial pathogens and present evidence to suggest that they contribute significantly to catheter colonisation. The type 3 fimbrial genes from E. coli MS2027 were found to be located on a conjugative plasmid. Sequencing and annotation revealed that this 42,644 bp plasmid, named pMAS2027, contains 58 putative genes. Bioinformatic analysis identified pMAS2027 as an incompatibility X (IncX1) plasmid. Plasmid pMAS2027 contained genes encoding two important virulence factors, type 3 fimbriae and a type IV secretion (T4S) system. The biofilm ability was solely based on the expression of type 3 fimbriae and not the T4S system. The T4S system, however, accounted for the conjugative ability of pMAS2027. Differential tagging with fluorescent reporter genes demonstrated conjugative transfer of pMAS2027 between cells during biofilm growth. Finaly, transposon mutagenesis of E. coli M184 revealed a number of putative genes potentially responsible for bacterial aggregation. Of these, genes involved in the synthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) were shown to be associated with an aggregation phenotype.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UPEC</field><field name="subject">CAUTI</field><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Type 3 fimbriae</field><field name="subject">Aggregation</field><field name="subject">Conjugation</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178812</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Variable Viscosity Forced and Free Convection in Porous Media</field><field name="creator">Kamel Hooman</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses modeling transport phenomena in porous media with special attention being paid to convective characteristics of variable viscosity fluids in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. Two different categories of flows, with totally different driving forces, are considered being forced and free convection (both side and bottom heating, for a square enclosure, are studied). To account for property variation, the density is modeled by an Oberbeck&#8211;Boussinesq approximation while the viscosity is modeled by an exponential function. The limitations of the previous work, addressing the issue, are discussed in detail and improvements, in terms of thermo-hydraulic performance of the system are suggested. Dealing with the global aspects of the problem, the two major methods being the reference temperature and the property ratio approach are implemented. For natural convection problems, the former method is used; while for forced convection the latter is undertaken. New correlations, which are proved to be more accurate, are proposed for both forced and free convection problems. Besides, closed form solutions are reported for some cases of constant and variable viscosity. Convection visualization is also studied in detail where the concept of Energy Flux Vectors is put forward along with the application of heatlines and energy streamlines. It was mathematically shown that in two-dimensional space heatlines and energy streamlines, which were invented independently, are the same as each other. Moreover, the newly developed concept, energy flux vectors serve as a new tool for convection visualization with the main advantage that this new technique, unlike heatlines and energy streamlines, does not require further (and sometimes complicated) numerical analysis in addition to solving momentum and thermal energy equations. This, in its turn, reduces the time and computer resources required to see the flow of energy. Finally, in Chapter 7, the summary of the work along with the conclusions are presented. Finally, recommendations for future studies are put forward.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porous media</field><field name="subject">variable property</field><field name="subject">free convection</field><field name="subject">forced convection</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">analytical</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179544</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the growth behaviour of epitaxial InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures using electron microscopy</field><field name="creator">Mohanchand Paladugu</field><field name="description">Materials in smaller scales exhibit promising properties that are useful for wide variety of applications. Semiconductor quantum wells and quantum dots are two main examples of low-dimensional systems, where the quantum wells act as two-dimensional systems and the quantum dots act as zero-dimensional systems. Alternatively, semiconductor nanowires act as one-dimensional materials, and they exhibit promising and device applicable properties. These nanowires are relatively new class of materials compared to the quantum wells and the quantum dots. The semiconductor nanowires are expected to be the building blocks for future nanoelectronic and nano-optoelectronic device technology. Vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism is a widely used mechanism for the growth of semiconductor nanowires, where metal nanoparticles are used as the catalysts for the nanowires growth. This growth mechanism offers a flexibility to control the size, morphology and location of the semiconductor nanowires. In the VLS growth, changing the chemical composition of vapor constituents produce consequent compositional modulation in each nanowire. The compositional modulation along the nanowire axis produces axial nanowire heterostructures and in radial direction produces radial nanowire heterostructures. Such compositional modulation within an individual nanowire enables the designing of band structure of a nanowire and thereby allows the fabrication of single nanowire devices. These nanowire heterostructures show many potential properties and consequent applications. Although the semiconductor nanowire heterostructures are promising semiconductor nanostructures, the fundamental growth mechanisms of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures have not been explored sufficiently due to their complex nature of the growth. In this regard, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues associated with axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. For such fundamental investigations, this PhD work chooses InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system due to its potential applications. In fact, InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are the first reported axial nanowire heterostructure system. However, no detailed investigations were reported on this system so far. The detailed nucleation and growth mechanisms associated with InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system are explored in this thesis using electron microscopy investigations. This objective is achieved in the following steps. &#8226; InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are grown using Au nanoparticles and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method. To determine the axial and radial growth evolution of InAs on GaAs nanowires, different InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are produced by depositing InAs for different durations on GaAs nanowires. The GaAs nanowires are initially grown for 30 min and then the InAs is deposited on these nanowires for 1, 3, 5 and 30 min. &#8226; These InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations. These investigations determine that, in the initial stages of the InAs axial growth (1 min), the Au particles move sidewards and subsequently downwards by maintaining an interface with the GaAs nanowire. Such a movement of Au catalysts is attributed to lower Au/GaAs interfacial energy than Au/InAs. The detailed TEM investigations show that this Au movement depends upon the crystallographic nature of the GaAs nanowire. The Au particle is always tend to move towards {112}B sidewall of the GaAs nanowire rather than its {112}A sidewalls. Increase in InAs growth duration shows that InAs branches evolve from GaAs-InAs core-shell structures. Such evolution is observed in following steps: (1) the movement of Au particle terminates when it encounters the radially grown InAs on GaAs nanowires; (2) further growth of InAs leads to the InAs nanowire growth from those terminated Au nanoparticles in the form of branches. &#8226; The TEM observations of InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures show that, in the initial stages of InAs radial growth on GaAs nanowires, InAs nucleates preferentially in the concave regions of the non-planar sidewalls of the GaAs nanowire. The further growth of InAs leads to the preferential formation of InAs shell structure at the regions of concave regions. Such heterogeneous formation of shell structure resembles InAs nanoring structures around GaAs nanowire cores. InAs growth on the planar {112} sidewalls of GaAs nanowires with hexagonal cross sections shows different growth phenomena to the above described InAs nanorings formation. In this case, InAs preferentially nucleates on {112}A sidewalls of the GaAs nanowires and with further deposition of InAs, the complete shell structure of InAs form with {110} sidewalls on the GaAs nanowire cores. &#8226; In addition to the above mentioned investigations, to observe the growth evolution of GaAs on InAs nanowires, GaAs is grown for 3 and 30 min on InAs nanowires. The TEM investigations of these nanostructures show that the axial GaAs/InAs hetero-interface contains an InGaAs transition segment in contrast to the sharp InAs/GaAs (InAs on GaAs) hetero-interface. The different nature of hetero-interfaces is attributed to the different affinities between Au catalysts and Ga or In. The radial growth of GaAs on InAs nanowires show that the GaAs shell has grown in wurtzite structure around the wurtzite structured InAs nanowire cores. Overall, through the extensive SEM and TEM investigations, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues related to the growth of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. Such fundamental investigations are expected to advance the processing and application prospective of the semiconductor nanowires and their associated heterostructures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanowires, nanostructures, heterostructures, nucleation and growth, self-assembly of matter, vapor liquid solid mechanism, materials science, nanotechnology, transmission electron microscopy, crystal growth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179967</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying the ecological values of brigalow regrowth for woodland birds: a hierarchical landscape approach</field><field name="creator">Michiala Bowen</field><field name="description">The conversion of native forests to pastures and crops is one of the most extensive causes of deforestation worldwide. Concomitant with agricultural landscape modification are the processes of habitat loss and fragmentation, which are major causes of species&#8217; extinctions, population declines and altered ecosystem functions. However, in many tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions, abandoned agricultural lands are reverting to regrowth or secondary forest, which represents an important opportunity for passive landscape restoration. Regrowth may be particularly important in highly modified landscapes, where the area of mature forest may be insufficient to support viable plant and animal communities without some form of restoration. Some studies of fauna populations in regrowth forest have found recovery of species richness within several decades, although recovery of species composition may take at least 100 years and some species may be permanently lost. While these findings are encouraging, they generally fail to account for the landscape context in which regrowth occurs and focus mainly on tropical forests. The aim of this thesis was to advance the understanding of fauna recovery in regrowth forests on abandoned agricultural land by: i) comparing woodland bird communities in a replicated chronosequence of semi-arid sub-tropical regrowth forests; and ii) quantifying how the ecological values of regrowth habitat vary among stand-, patch- and landscape-levels of ecological organisation. A review of 68 studies of fauna recovery in regrowth forests, revealed that current knowledge is limited by the predominance of studies conducted: in tropical rainforests; with minimal replication of sites; in landscapes within proximity of large tracts of relatively undisturbed mature forests; and with limited consideration of the influence of the spatial context on fauna recovery in regrowth forest. This study makes a significant contribution to understanding fauna recovery in regrowth forests by quantifying the recovery of estimated bird species richness to levels similar to mature forest, within a period of 30-60 years, in highly modified semi-arid agricultural landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. An ordination of the similarity in species composition among forest types also suggested that after 30-60 years regrowth bird communities are more similar to mature brigalow forest than the younger regrowth. This is important for the recovery of brigalow ecosystems, an endangered ecological community where regrowth is currently given minimal protection from further clearing. Comparisons of the importance of habitat attributes using model averaging and hierarchical partitioning of generalised linear models of the species richness of woodland birds showed that bird species richness was positively associated with patch age, and that stand-level factors such as grazing disturbance and the abundance of mistletoes (Amyema spp.) were also important. The spatial context of vegetation patches (size, shape and isolation) was equally important for bird species richness, with more species of woodland dependent, nectar/frugivores and non-ground foraging insectivores occurring in less modified landscape contexts, and the converse for generalist species, ground foraging insectivores and granivores. While a number of woodland dependent bird species known to be in decline in temperate woodlands of southern Australia were absent or rare in regrowth forests, several species (e.g., eastern yellow robin) also occupied regrowth habitats. This finding suggests that these more sensitive species may respond positively to landscape restoration through targeted retention of brigalow regrowth. The landscape-level amount of forest varied in importance among regrowth age classes and bird groups. In general, the amount and number of mature forest patches in the landscape were of lower importance than local attributes. However, the amount of mature forest and old regrowth (&gt; 30 years) in the landscape did have an important positive influence on the number of woodland bird species and species&#8217; abundance; suggesting that regrowth is making an important contribution to landscape recovery in the study area. Mistletoe abundance was strongly dependent on particular species of frugivores for seed dispersal (e.g., mistletoebird, spiny-cheeked honeyeater and painted honeyeater), and varied considerably among three sub-regions of the study area. In general, mistletoe abundance increased in linear patches and more highly modified landscapes but was also dependent on the abundance of seed dispersers and brigalow stand condition. These findings suggest that narrow linear patches in brigalow landscapes can have important conservation values for woodland birds. The study outcomes have important implications for research and management of regrowth vegetation, both within Australia and internationally. From an international perspective, the study highlights the need for greater consideration of the importance of regrowth forest in a landscape context for conserving and restoring fauna communities. From an Australian perspective, the study provides important baseline information for the conservation and management of woodland bird habitat in fragmented brigalow landscapes. Prior to this research, very little was known on the spatial ecology of woodland birds in the region. The study highlights the important conservation values of small and often linear mature brigalow patches for woodland birds and the considerable potential for restoration of habitat for a diverse range of species through the retention of regrowth vegetation. In particular, the research outcomes suggest that targeting the retention of regrowth towards increasing the size and reducing the isolation of mature brigalow forests may be an effective strategy to maximise biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth stands will need to be retained for at least 60 years and probably longer to maintain viable woodland bird communities. For this to happen on a regional-scale, brigalow regrowth needs to be given greater recognition for potential biodiversity benefits either within a legislative framework or by incentive schemes to promote the long term persistence of regrowth habitat within the landscape.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">land abandonment</field><field name="subject">Regrowth</field><field name="subject">fauna recovery</field><field name="subject">woodland birds</field><field name="subject">agricultural landscape</field><field name="subject">Habitat Loss</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">spatial pattern</field><field name="subject">Acacia harpophylla</field><field name="subject">brigalow</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184589</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpretive and Source-Oriented Approaches: Modern Japanese Free Verse Poetry in English Translation</field><field name="creator">William Fryer</field><field name="description">This study examines two translation approaches prominent among English translations of modern Japanese free verse poetry. The purpose is twofold: to provide a critical history of the first book-length English translations of individual poets, published over roughly a ten-year period; and to identify and examine, among those publications, works that took a distinctive and challenging translation approach. The main argument is that the chief works examined in this study each present a differing approach that challenges the dominant postwar discourse on translation in the Japanese literary studies community. The study fills a conspicuous gap in translation studies, since it is the first in-depth examination of modern Japanese poetry in translation. It focuses on two translation approaches, specifically &#8220;interpretive&#8221; and &#8220;source-oriented&#8221; translation, which have tended to be loosely associated with the vague notions of &#8220;free&#8221; translation and &#8220;literal&#8221; translation respectively. The importance of the study stems from its clarified definitions of these approaches through analyses of published translations featuring their rigorous use. It also suggests arguments for and implications of using and identifying these approaches, both for the translator and for translation scholars. Modern poetry was chosen as a genre because it features the two approaches prominently and because it was felt important to focus on a genre somewhat marginalised among publications of Japanese literature in translation. The study focuses in particular on translations published in the period 1968-1978, because this represented a flowering period of publications of modern Japanese poetry, including the first book-length publications of individual poets. Chapter One has two parts: definitions and contexts. The definitions section is a brief discussion of translation theory focusing on views that have gone beyond the &#8220;literal&#8221; versus &#8220;free&#8221; argument, and it examines a number of significant statements in the field of translations studies in order to develop useful definitions of key terms used throughout the study. The second half contextualises the significance of the chosen publications in the Japanese literary studies community. This includes a brief history of translation and translation theory focusing on the views of the dominant translators in the early postwar years, including discussions, disagreements or criticisms concerning the &#8220;right&#8221; way to translate. It also includes an analysis of attitudes towards modern poetry among scholars and translators of Japanese literature and a brief discussion of translations of modern Japanese poetry. Chapter Two examines poet Gary Snyder&#8217;s interpretive and transformative translations of Miyazawa Kenji&#8217;s (1896-1933) poems &#8220;Haru to shura&#8221; (Spring and Asura) and &#8220;Nusubito&#8221; (The Thief). The chapter shows how Snyder&#8217;s renditions of these poems can be related to the structure and themes of his own poetry collection The Back Country (1968) in which the translations appeared. By throwing his interpretive reading of these poems into the translations, as well as making some creative adjustments, Snyder allows the translations to fit within the thematic movement of his own collection. This chapter also argues that the act of identifying interpretive approaches in the case of poet-translators can be an an important tool in establishing links between the translations and the poet&#8217;s original literary works, and even further links with the poet&#8217;s life and philosophy. Chapter Three examines Hiroaki Sato&#8217;s translations of Hagiwara Sakutar&#333; (1886-1942) in Howling at the Moon (1978). Sato takes an estranging, source-oriented approach similar to Lawrence Venuti&#8217;s concept of &#8220;foreignisation&#8221;, an approach that signals the difference of the source text and culture by departing from accepted language usage. With Sato&#8217;s translations we can observe the estranging effect of the source-oriented approach working in two directions: suggesting the difference of source text syntax from the target language perspective; and giving an equivalent effect of some unusual language use that was already estranging for source language readers. Sato sees the estranging function of Sakutar&#333;&#8217;s syntax as an essential element of his poetry, and has developed his whole translation strategy around this view. Chapter Four discusses Cid Corman and Kamaike Susumu&#8217;s translations of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems in frogs &amp;. others. (1969). As with Sato&#8217;s versions of Sakutar&#333;, Corman and Kamaike take a source-oriented approach, and their clever use of text selection and ordering as translation strategies has enabled them to convey their interpretation of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems as directing a defamiliarising gaze back at humans and human society. Rather than aiming for complete linguistic accuracy as Sato does, they focus on a mirror-image source-oriented approach&#8212;often reproducing the source text&#8217;s word order and line order&#8212;not only as a means to suggest Kusano&#8217;s syntax, but also as a form of language experimentation and wordplay that enables their translations to stand out as autonomous poetic texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">modern</field><field name="subject">free verse</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">Miyazawa Kenji</field><field name="subject">Hagiwara Sakutar&#333;</field><field name="subject">Kusano Shinpei</field><field name="subject">Literature in Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185287</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opposition to C. Julius Caesar: Motives, Methods, Successes and the Question of Tyranny.</field><field name="creator">Mark Avery</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the motives, methods and successes of opposition to C. Julius Caesar in the period 60-50 leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49. An attempt has been made to distinguish between traditional and innovative methods of opposition. An evaluation of creativity levels and the social acceptability of actions has been conducted in an effort to understand adherence to moral standards in the pre-war period. In Chapter 2, opposition to Caesar in 60 and 59 is examined and found to be fierce, persistent and, despite Caesar ultimately achieving his aims, successful in a limited way. Chapter 3 examines the circumstances of 58-57. Caesar&#8217;s position was more firmly secured through the agency of Clodius&#8217; tribunate, during which Cicero was exiled and Cato was removed from the political scene for both political and personal reasons. Examination of opposition to Caesar in Chapter 4 focuses on the period 56-54. It is demonstrated that prior to the conferences of Luca and Ravenna, opposition to Caesar was broadly undertaken by groups or individuals who fomented dissent between Crassus and Pompey in order to undermine the triumvirate as a whole. In 55 opposition to Caesar was nullified by a renewal of the triumvirate. In 54 opposition was resurgent and dominated the courts with limited success. In Chapter 5, opposition to Caesar in the period 53-50 is examined and is shown to be marked by anarchy, attempted reforms and the disintegration of the triumviral alliance. Given widespread impressions of pressure, corruption, violence and breakdown, especially in modern accounts of the period, it is suprising to discover that tactics used by Caesar&#8217;s opponents were traditional and socially acceptable for the most part, despite vehement political and personal disagreement. The will of the people was still respected by Caesar&#8217;s opponents; popular opinion in 59 was in fact the cause of opposition failure. While the Republic had suffered civil war in the opening decades of the first century BC, the state had resumed constitutional operation prior to 60. Traditional moral values and methods of gaining rank and prestige were still important and continued to be adhered to after 60. Methods of influence and social communication remained largely unchanged in the 50s, and ensured the continuity of political exchange without substantial innovation. From 56 to 54 opposition methods were opportunistic, a result of the renewal of the triumvirate. Caesar&#8217;s opponents continued to adhere to traditional political practice, despite dominance of the political machinary by the triumvirate. In 54 Caesar&#8217;s opponents gained control of the law courts, which resulted in numerous trials but no break with traditional or socially acceptable behaviour. Opposition between 53 and 50 remained traditional in most cases within an environment marked by anarchy and political stalemate, fueled by the intransigence of Caesar and Pompey who refused to recognise each others&#8217; dignitas. The Civil War, then, was not caused by an extended period of constitutional instability. The Civil War was the result of political deadlock at the end of the 50s, motivated by the social and political inflexibility of a small group of Senators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">caesar, roman republic, politics, roman law, voting assemblies, roman senate, pompey, cicero, cato minor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186132</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Life and Times of Alex Doucas: Migrant and Author: Searching for a new identity</field><field name="creator">Abraham Sophocleous</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis offers the first detailed critical account of the Greek-Australian writer, Alex Doucas (1900-1962) who came to Australia in 1927 as a migrant from Asia Minor. It attempts to place his work in the perspectives of Greek and Australian literatures and to evaluate his position both as a migrant and as a writer. The Asia Minor Catastrophe and the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923, as well as the Great Depression he faced in Australia along with many other Australians had a profound effect on his social outlook. Considered one of the pioneers of Greek-Australian Literature, Doucas played an important role in the development of Greek community life in Australia during the pre- and post-World War II periods. His work consists of two published novels (one posthumously) and a significant body of published and unpublished, stories, poems, translations and essays. Out of print for some decades, it remains largely unknown to the general public or even to academic circles in Greece and in Australia. It was, however, a landmark of Greek-Australian Literature and continues to have more than historical interest in its treatment of migration, exile and displacement, and in its use of intercultural perspectives to forge a positive vision for humanity. Although forced into ill-paid manual labour for much of his life after his arrival in Australia, Alex Doucas tried to develop links and relationships with Australian intellectual circles and to become involved in Australian life in the broadest way. At the same time, he never lost contact with social, political and literary developments in Greece. Alex Doucas maintained close relations with both the Greek and Australian literary traditions. As a writer he belongs to the Greek generation of the 1930s and its literary traditions. In his work, he dealt with events which took place in Anatolia before the Asia Minor Catastrophe as well as with the impact the catastrophe had on Greek society. He is one of the first writers of his generation who turned his attention to the &#8220;other side of the coin&#8221; and investigated the impact of the Catastrophe on the Turkish people. This perspective was adopted mainly due to the openness that he found in Australia, an openness that led to Multiculturalism. Alex Doucas was a multiculturalist before his time. His work is a fine example of the Australian version of Multiculturalism. Through his brother Stratis Doucas (also a writer) and others, he kept himself informed on all sorts of changes and developments in his native country, Greece, especially as it was shaped after the Asia Minor Catastrophe. At the same time, he tried to understand the Australian way of life, its culture and its literary traditions. His bi-cultural position gave him a powerful perspective. He attempted to understand the Australian way of life through his Greekness and to find answers for problematic events that happened in Greece through his Australian experience. Across the entire span of Doucas&#8217;s work, it is clear that his political philosophy and his belief in the goals of socialism played a crucial role in his consciousness of himself as a writer whose role was to provide the artistic equivalent of the philosophical basis of Marxism, best expressed in the Theses on Feuerbach (1845) by Marx, in his famous dictum, "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it". In other words, it was never enough for Doucas simply to describe in social realist terms the conditions of life and the aspirations of human beings. His aim was to show how these conditions might be changed for the better, not only for the individual, but for the community as a whole. Equally, he wished to show how people&#8217;s aspirations, particularly those of an immigrant community familiar with exile, suffering and loss, might be more fully realised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural literature, migrant literature, comparative literature, social realism, asia minor catastrophe, modern greek literature, australian literature, literary traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187944</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergency Control Power System Separation</field><field name="creator">Victer Chin</field><field name="description">Power systems in many countries are stressed towards their stability limit. If these stable systems experience any unexpected contingencies, or disturbances, there is a significant risk of instability, which may lead to wide-spread blackout. Existing methods to minimize the risk of stability and excessive frequency decline; need to be redeveloped to address these new challenges. This research project will develop a new emergency control methodology, which can more effectively prevent power system frequency and voltage instability under emergency conditions. Frequency and voltage instability are two major concerns in power system operation. The primary aim of this project is to develop new optimal load shedding techniques, which are able to better address various voltage and frequency instability issues for power systems emergency control purpose. In this thesis, new approach of load shedding for frequency and voltage stability are presented. For the load shedding to prevent frequency collapse, System Frequency Respond &#8211; Under Frequency Load Shedding (SFR-UFLS) from the previous approach has been redeveloped to compute an optimal load shedding scheme. The limitation of previous optimal load shed method is that they only shed load following one particular contingency event. As an improvement of this method, we developed a technique that protects against a range of contingencies. For the load shedding to prevent voltage collapse, The proposed method is then tested on the 39-bus New England test system. Generators are of different importance to the system in terms of voltage stability. It is essential to investigate generators&#8217; impact on system voltage stability. The theory of the normal forms of diffeomorphism is used to analyze the power flow equations, and then nonlinear active participation factor is obtained and is used to determine the influence of generators on voltage stability. By using this method, the nonlinearity of power systems can be taken into consideration while the computational efficiency is maintained. Therefore, the impact of generators can be measured with more accuracy even for the cases in which the system is characterized with strong nonlinearity. In order to show the validity of the proposed method, the IEEE 14-bus test system and the New England 39-bus power system are used as case studies. The steady-state voltage stability index verifies the proposed method. The results show that nonlinear active participation factor can describe the characteristics even when power systems are operating at a highly stressed condition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">Under Frequency Load Sheeding (UFLS)</field><field name="subject">Systerm Frequency Response (SFR) model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188137</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First language influence on second language syntactic processing of English relative clauses</field><field name="creator">Ken-ichi Hashimoto</field><field name="description">Fluent sentence comprehension requires the automatic application of grammatical principles, in combination with other kinds of information, to a linear input string. The latter can vary greatly in complexity, and it has been observed that structures that involve non-adjacent relationships (non-local dependencies) cause particular processing difficulties, for even fluent readers. This thesis focuses on the potential role that L1 transfer plays in processing non-local dependencies in the L2. Although L1 transfer has been demonstrated in a variety of L2 domains (Juffs, 2005), the degree to which L1 syntactic properties influence the L2 in real-time processing remains an open question (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). A better understanding of L1 influence on L2 processing has important implications for emerging models of L2 sentence processing and SLA theory in general. This thesis examines L1 effects on the processing of L2 English relative clauses. It builds on established models of L1 relative clause processing (e.g., Gibson, 1998) and focuses on the asymmetry observed in the processing of subject versus object relative clauses. Research has shown that L1 individuals find object relative clauses more difficult to process than their subject counterparts (King &amp; Just, 1991), and off-line L2 research suggests that this asymmetry might hold for L2 processing as well (Izumi, 2003; Kanno, 2007). This thesis will examine the asymmetry on-line and investigate the role that L1 background plays in on-line performance, both alone and in combination with other processing factors. The main data are on-line performance by three groups of advanced-level learners of L2 English from Japan, China, and Vietnam. The three L1s differ from English to varying degrees in relative clause formation, as reflected in head direction, branching direction and the presence of an overt relative marker. Vietnamese shares all three properties with English and Japanese none, leading to the prediction that the Japanese learners will have the greatest difficulty, as evident in the largest subject/object asymmetry in processing times. Evidence for the effect of L1 syntactic properties on L2 processing will be sought in a set of studies that compare processing outcomes for these learners across key individual difference factors in L2 processing, working memory capacity, lexical processing efficiency, and proficiency. The effect of non-structural information, in the form of animacy contrasts and frequency effects, on L2 syntactic processing across the L1 groups will also be examined. By systematically examining group differences across these key factors, the degree and nature of potential L1 influence on the processing of these non-local dependencies can be better assessed. Three groups of advanced-level L2 English learners from China, Japan, and Vietnam, a group of intermediate-level learners in Japan, and native English controls participated in the data collection. Participants were first tested on a battery of individual difference measures that established language proficiency and general processing skill for individual participants and groups. On-line reading data of relative clause structures were then collected and reported in a set of five studies. Study 1 examined reading when the target structures contained high frequency content words, which minimized word recognition demands. Advanced L2 learners took longer to read object relative clauses, and the difference was the greatest for the Japanese group. Study 2 revealed that the subject/object asymmetry and L1 influence evident in Study 1 disappeared when word recognition was effortful, as in sentences with low frequency words, suggesting that L1 syntactic influence may only be evident when lexical processing is relatively automatic. Study 3 examined the effect of proficiency differences on processing outcomes by comparing performance by Intermediate and Advanced Japanese learners. The Intermediate learners showed no subject/object asymmetry in sentences with high frequency words, providing further evidence that processing efficiency is a key factor when considering possible L1 effects in L2 processing. Study 4 demonstrated that advanced L2 learners benefited from animacy cues in on-line processing, with the difficulty associated with object relative sentences and the L1 effect evident in sentences with animate head nouns neutralized in sentences with inanimate head nouns. The findings indicate that L2 learners may rely on lexical information as an alternative to syntactic knowledge in some cases. Finally, Study 5 compared processing performance on full or reduced relative clauses to examine both the influence of L1 syntactic properties and L1 structural frequency biases on L2 processing outcomes. Although the influence of frequency information was not evident, the results suggested that the availability of an overt relative marker in the L1 affected L2 processing outcomes. Overall, the results provide some support for the view that L1 background influences the processing of complex syntactic structures in the L2, a finding consistent with Juffs (2005) but contrary to Clahsen et al. (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). However, the effect is sensitive to a range of factors, which appears to support the claim by the latter that L2 learners may rely more on lexical-semantic information than L1 individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relative clause</field><field name="subject">syntactic processing</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer</field><field name="subject">L2 processing</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">word recognition</field><field name="subject">proficiency</field><field name="subject">animacy</field><field name="subject">structural frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interferon-Induced Antiviral Protein MxA: Functional and Therapeutic Aspects Relating to Virus Infection</field><field name="creator">Antje Hoenen</field><field name="description">Our innate immunity is our first line of defence against pathogens. We require this immunity to control the numerous viral infections we are challenged with during our lives. However, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms of our innate immunity, particularly components that have specific antiviral potential. One potent mediator of this antiviral activity is the interferon system. Activation of the interferon system leads to the production of several interferon-induced proteins, which inhibit the multiplication of viruses by distinct mechanisms. A key example of one of these mediators is the human MxA protein. Human MxA has the capacity to inhibit many different viruses from diverse families. In many cases it is proposed that MxA interferes with key viral components, such as incoming or newly formed nucleocapsids. It is speculated that MxA traps and missorts these viral components so they are no longer available for virus production and virus dissemination is inhibited. West Nile virus belongs to Flaviviridae family of viruses and was involved in the outbreak of virus-associated encephalitis in New York City in 1999. In this thesis I show that West Nile virus is insensitive to antiviral activity of MxA and describe how West Nile virus has developed a replication strategy that avoids MxA recognition and activation. I show that virus-induced changes of cytoplasmic membranes provide a protective microenvironment for viral replication and the viral components essential for viral replication. This hypothesis was proven by preventing the formation of these membrane structures with the fungal chemical Brefeldin A. Under these conditions I observed that stable expression of MxA could partially restrict West Nile virus RNA replication. Subsequently, I showed that the assembly mechanism of West Nile virus prevents interaction between the MxA protein and the viral capsid proteins. This was achieved by the use of a trans-packaging cell line whereby the West Nile virus structural proteins are expressed stably in trans instead of in cis from the polyprotein. When this cell line was transfected with a West Nile virus replicon expressing the human MxA protein distinct co-localisation and redistribution of the MxA with West Nile virus capsid proteins into large tubular structures within the cytoplasm of transfected cells was observed. Strikingly, these tubular aggregates are visually analogous to structures observed during infection of MxA expressing cells infected with members of the Bunyaviridae, particularly La Crosse virus. Moreover, retargeting MxA to specific sites of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells transfected with the West Nile virus infectious clone resulted in co-localisation between MxA and the West Nile virus capsid proteins and significantly inhibited the production of infectious particles. These results suggest that the sequestering of viral capsids within cytoplasmic inclusions maybe a conserved mechanism for antiviral activity of the MxA protein across the viruses families and highlight the innate ability of such molecules to recognise key molecular patterns within pathogens. Finally, I sought to exploit the antiviral potential of MxA as a therapeutic agent against infection with Influenza A viruses; viruses that have a very high sensitivity for the antiviral activity of MxA. By expressing MxA from the West Nile virus replicon, infection with the highly pathogenic Influenza virus H5N1 strain could be inhibited in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies in Mx-negative mice indicated that intranasal inoculation with MxA expressed from the West Nile virus replicon can protect these mice against an otherwise lethal infection with a low pathogenic Influenza A virus. Taken all together, in this thesis I provide evidence that strongly supports the existence of an evolutionary working mechanism of a significant mediator of our immune system, the antiviral MxA protein. Furthermore, I show how an important human pathogen, such as West Nile virus has evolved a replication strategy to evade this antiviral protein. These results will open new pathways for the development of a new type of antiviral therapies that utilize the potent antiviral activity of the MxA protein.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MxA</field><field name="subject">Interferon</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Influenza A virus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190513</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">sRAGE, S100 proteins and PTPN22 C1858T genetic polymorphism in rheumatoid arthritis</field><field name="creator">Yueh-Sheng Chen</field><field name="description">Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. Measurement of the level of serum markers (sRAGE, S100A9, S100A8 and S100A12) and genetic testing for the presence of the PTPN22 genetic polymorphism could help elucidate the underlying cause of inflammation and complications in RA, such as atherosclerosis. Therefore, serum levels of sRAGE, S100A9, S100A8 and S100A12 were measured by ELISA in patients with established RA (n=138). The associations between the serum levels of these molecules; and inflammatory markers and RA complications were analysed by multiple linear regression modelling. Established RA patients (n=192) were investigated for the PTPN22 C1858T genetic polymorphism by PCR-RFLP. Multiple logistic regression modelling was used to examine the association between PTPN22 C1858T genetic polymorphism and inflammatory markers and RA complications. In RA patients, we found that serum levels of S100A9 were associated with the body mass index (BMI); and the presence of S100A8 and S100A12. The serum levels of S100A8 in RA patients were associated with the presence of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, rheumatoid factor and S100A9. The serum levels of S100A12 in RA patients were associated with the presence of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies and S100A9; and a history of diabetes. Inflammatory markers and RA complications were not associated with the PTPN22 genetic polymorphism in established RA patients; serum level of triglyceride was the only variable associated with PTPN22 C1858T in multiple logistic regression analysis. Taken together, these data suggest that serum levels of sRAGE, S100A9 and S100A12 protein may be useful correlates of inflammation and autoantibody production in RA patients. Further studies are recommended to determine whether these markers predict clinical outcomes when measured at the onset of RA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rheumatoid Arthritis (ra)</field><field name="subject">RAGE</field><field name="subject">sRAGE</field><field name="subject">S100A9</field><field name="subject">S100A8</field><field name="subject">S100A12</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular diseases</field><field name="subject">Vascular Complications</field><field name="subject">PTPN22</field><field name="subject">Regression Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194151</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualization, design, and scaling of drop generation in coflow processes</field><field name="creator">Manuela Duxenneuner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drop formation, coflow, monodispersity, scaling, dimensionless numbers, microfluidics, microPIV, hydroxypropyl-ether guar gum, Tween, sunflower oil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194990</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Drinfeld Double of Dihedral Groups and Integrable Systems</field><field name="creator">Peter Finch</field><field name="description">A little over 20 years ago Drinfeld presented the quantum (or Drinfeld) double construction. This construction takes any Hopf algebra and embeds it in a larger quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, which contains an algebraic solution to the constant Yang&#8211;Baxter equation. One such class of algebras consists of the Drinfeld doubles of &#64257;nite groups, which are currently of interest due to their connections with non-Abelian anyons. The smallest non-commutative Drinfeld double of a &#64257;nite group algebra is the Drinfeld double of D3 , the dihedral group of order six, which was recently used to construct solutions to the Yang&#8211;Baxter equation cor- responding to 2-state and 3-state integrable spin chains with periodic boundary conditions. In this thesis we construct R-matrices from the Drinfeld double of dihedral group algebras, D(Dn) and consider their associated integrable systems. The 3-state spin chain from D(D3) is generalised to include open boundaries and it is also shown that there exists a more general R-matrix for this algebra. For general D(Dn) an R-matrix is constructed as a descendant of the zero-&#64257;eld six-vertex model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yang-baxter Equation</field><field name="subject">descendants</field><field name="subject">Drinfeld double</field><field name="subject">quantum double</field><field name="subject">finite group algebra</field><field name="subject">dihedral group</field><field name="subject">Integrable Systems</field><field name="subject">Reflection Equation</field><field name="subject">R-matrices</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201594</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Defining Sets in Latin Squares and two Intersection Problems, one for Latin Squares and one for Steiner Triple Systems</field><field name="creator">Thomas Mccourt</field><field name="description">Consider distinct latin squares, L and M, of order n. Then the pair (T1, T2) where T1 = L \M and T2 = M \ L is called a latin bitrade. Furthermore T1 and T2 are referred to as latin trades, in which T2 is said to be a disjoint mate of T1 (and vice versa). Dr&#225;pal (1991) showed that, under certain conditions, a partition of an equilateral triangle of side length n, where n is some integer, into smaller, integer length sided equilateral triangles gives rise to a latin trade within the latin square based on the addition table for the integers modulo n. A partial latin square P of order n is said to be completable if there exists a latin square L of order n such that P &#8838; L. If there is only one such possible latin square, L, of order n then P is said to be uniquely completable and P is called a defining set of L. Furthermore, if C is a uniquely completable partial latin square such that no proper subset of C is uniquely completable, C is said to be a critical set or a minimal defining set. These concepts, namely latin trades and defining sets in latin squares, are intimately connected by the following observation. If L is a latin square and D &#8838; L is a defining set, then D intersects all latin bitrades for which one mate is contained in L. In Part I of this thesis Dr&#180;apal&#8217;s result is applied to investigate the structure of certain defining sets in latin squares. The results that are obtained are interesting in themselves; furthermore, the geometric approach to the problem yields additional appealing results. These geometric results are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6. They pertain to partitioning regions (polygons in R2 that satisfy certain obvious conditions) into equilateral, integer length sided, triangles, such that no point, in the region, is a corner of more than three distinct triangles. In Chapter 2 one of the main two theorems on defining sets is established, as is a method for using the above geometric results to prove the nonexistence of certain types of defining sets. In Part II of this thesis, intersection problems, for latin squares and Steiner triple systems, are considered. The seminal works, for problems of these types, are due to Lindner and Rosa (1975) and Fu (1980). A natural progression, from the established literature, for intersection problems between elements in a pair of latin squares or Steiner triple systems is to problems in which the intersection is composed of a number of disjoint configurations (isomorphic copies of some specified partial triple system). In this thesis solutions to two intersection problems for disjoint configurations are detailed. An m-flower, (F,F), is a partial triple system/configuration, such that: F = {{x, yi, zi} | {yi, zi} &#8745; {yj , zj} = &#8709;, for 0 &#8804; i, j &#8804; m &#8722; 1, i 6= j}; and F = UX&#8712;FX. The first such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k and m &#8805; 2 such that a pair of latin squares of order n exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint m-flowers. The necessary terminology, constructions, lemmas and proof for this result are contained in Chapters 7, 8 and 9. The second such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k such that a pair of Steiner triple systems of order u exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint 2-flowers. This result relies on the solution to the latin square problem and an additional result from Chapter 9. The further constructions and lemmas used to prove this result are detailed in Chapter 10.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">latin trade</field><field name="subject">latin bitrade</field><field name="subject">triangulation</field><field name="subject">defining set</field><field name="subject">critical set</field><field name="subject">partial triple system</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple system</field><field name="subject">intersection problem</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Needs-based and needs-focused care: Understanding the needs of children and young people in care in Australia through the documentary analysis of multiple stakeholder perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stewart Redshaw</field><field name="description">Over the last decade out-of-home care in Australia has experienced a period of considerable turmoil as royal commissions, parliamentary inquiries, departmental audits, empirical research and industry reports have highlighted the dire straits of the care system. A constant theme throughout has been the failure of the sector to adequately meet the needs of children and young people in care. Within this context the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of children and young people in care in Australia, giving voice to the full range of stakeholders, whose views were expressed in multiple documentary types. Specifically, the aim was to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs and formulate this into a formal taxonomy of needs. Using document analysis and the constant comparative method within the constructivist paradigm of social inquiry, the study involved analysis of 580 non-traditional, naturalistic and secondary documents relating to out-of-home care in Australia. The document sample consisted of five data types: primary data (letters, submissions to inquiries, transcripts of interviews and public hearings, and personal accounts); secondary data (reports resulting from commissions of inquiries and departmental reviews, audits and investigations); empirical data (the published findings from empirical research); legislative and policy data (legislation, regulation and quality frameworks); and industry and practitioner data (reports by academics, peak bodies and advocacy groups, and writings by out-of-home care practitioners). Further, the document sample included stakeholders from five major groups: children and young people in care (and former wards ); their parents and extended family; carers, agency staff and practitioners; statutory workers; and academics, advocates, and representatives of state and national peak bodies. The findings include a series of prominent themes of care; salient findings that highlight the experiences and needs of children and young people in care; and the taxonomy of needs. The prominent themes include the importance of natural family connectedness, cultural identity and connectedness, and counselling and therapeutic support. Issues relating to placement stability and disruption, safety and protection and, transition from care also featured prominently. The salient findings include an exploration of the overwhelming emotions of care, emotional putdowns, vicarious trauma and the witnessing of violence and abuse in out-of-home care, characteristics of children and young people who survive and thrive in care and beyond, characteristics of quality carers, symptom intolerance, disenfranchised grief &#8211; the never-ending story, and the defensive behaviours of children and young people in care. The taxonomy of needs provides a comprehensive overview of the needs of children and young people in care across 89 attributes and 21 attribute sub-categories, within 21 dimensions, and across three domains (the personal, placement, and community-of-care domains). The dimensions in the personal domain include attachment, physical development and health, personal growth, education and vocational attainment, development of the inner-self, and hope in life and for the future. The placement domain includes basic needs, basic entitlements, caring relationships, positive-parenting-practices, activity programming, focused-support, peer-relations and positive group management, and preparation for and transition from care. The community-of-care domain includes clinical intervention, family connectedness and involvement in placement, friends and social outlets, significant others, cultural-religious-spiritual connectedness, departmental worker capacity and support, and after care support. The principal theoretical, practice, and methodological conclusions derived from this study are that children and young people in care in Australia have considerable needs, are largely unable to meet their own needs, and experience harm when their needs are not met. Consequently, the out-of-home care sector has an inescapable obligation to provide for these needs if children and young people in care are to avoid harm and experience personal wellbeing. Further, children and young people in care have experienced considerable need deprivation, and if their needs are not to be forgotten, then a shift to a &#8216;needs-based&#8217;, &#8216;needs-focused&#8217; paradigm of care is needed to inform out-of-home care policy, service design, and day-to-day practice. And finally, document analysis using non-traditional, naturalistic, and secondary data (representing the full range of stakeholder perspectives) within a constructivist paradigm of inquiry, provides an effective, indeed powerful methodology for exploring the needs of children and young people in care, and for giving voice to the many stakeholders who voices may never have been heard again.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Needs</field><field name="subject">Out-of-home care</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Quality care</field><field name="subject">Document analysis</field><field name="subject">Constant comparative method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202777</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-function relationships in metal dependent enzymes</field><field name="creator">Eleanor Wai Wai Leung</field><field name="description">Metalloproteins account for at least half of all known proteins. Metal ions often facilitate chemical that are energetically and/or kinetically challenging. Metal ion-dependent proteins are responsible for a myriad of essential biological functions, including respiration, biosynthesis of essential amino acids, nitrogen fixation, oxygen transport, photosynthesis and metabolisms (e.g. glycolysis and citric acid cycle). Not surprisingly, a growing number of disorders (e.g. various cancers, phenylketonuria, Wilson&#8217;s disease) are associated with mutations in metalloenzymes. A general introduction of the importance of metals in biology is presented in chapter 1. This thesis is aimed at obtaining a greater understanding of the structure and function of three metalloenzymes, ketol acid reductoisomerase (KARI), purple acid phosphatase (PAP) and metallo &#946; lactamase (M&#946;L). Chapter 2 examines the structure and dynamics of plant KARI. KARI is an enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. KARI is a binuclear Mg2+ enzyme that catalyses the conversion of 2-acetolactate (AL) into (2R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate or 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate into (2R, 3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylvalerate in the presence of NADPH. To date, the only reported structures for a plant KARI are those of the spinach enzyme-Mn2+-(phospho) ADP ribose-(2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylvalerate complex and the spinach KARI-Mg2+-NADPH-N-hydroxy-N-isopropyloxamate complex, where N-hydroxy-N-isopropyloxamate (IpOHA) is a predicted transition-state analog. These studies demonstrate that the enzyme is consisted of two domains, N- domain and C- domain, with the active site at the interface of these domains. In this chapter, the structures of the rice KARI-Mg2+ and rice KARI-Mg2+-NADPH complexes were determined to 1.55 and 2.8 &#197; resolutions, respectively. Comparisons of all the available plant KARI structures have revealed several major differences. Firstly, the N-domain is rotated up to 15o relative to the C-domain, expanding the active site by up to 4 &#197;. Secondly, an &#945;-helix in the C-domain that includes residues V510-T519 and forms part of the active site moves by ~ 3.9 &#197; upon binding of NADPH. Thirdly, the 15 C-terminal amino acid residues in the rice KARI-Mg2+ complex are disordered. In the rice KARI-Mg2+-NADPH complex and spinach KARI structures, many of the 15 residues bind to NADPH and the N-domain and cover the active site. Fourthly, the location of the metal ions within the active site can vary by up to 2.7 &#197;. The new structures have thus, led to the proposal of an induced-fit mechanism. In this proposed induced-fit mechanism, (i) substrate enters the active site, (ii) active site is closed during catalysis, and (iii) the opening of active site facilitates product release. PAP is also a binuclear metalloenzyme and is capable of utilizing a heterovalent active site to hydrolyse a broad range of phosphomonoester substrates. Chapter 3 examines the catalytic mechanism of PAP based on several new crystal structures. The red kidney bean PAP structure in complex in sulphate was determined to 2.4 &#197;. This sulphate-bound structure provides insight into the pre-catalytic phase of its reaction cycle. This stucture demonstrates the significance of an extensive hydrogen-bonding network in the second coordination in initial substrate binding and orientation prior to hydrolysis. Most importantly, the two metal ions, Fe3+ and Zn2+, are five-coordinate in this structure, with only one nucleophilic &#956;-hydroxide present in the metal-bridging position. In combination with kinetic, crystallographic and spectroscopic data, all PAP structures form the proposal of a comprehensive eight-step model for the catalytic mechanism of purple acid phosphatases in general. To date, no reliable method for producing recombinant PAP at levels suitable for structural biology have been reported. Natural sources are the only way so far to obtaining PAP in a large quantity. Attempts to produce active and recombinant PAP from Mycobacterium marinum using bacterial are found in chapter 4. In brief, in combination with Nus fusion tag, Rosetta (DE3) strain and lower temperature (e.g. 25oC), expression of soluble and mycobacterial PAP becomes possible. However, this soluble protein is non-functional and thus, switching into other expression system (e.g.algal sytem) is the only approach to obtain soluble and functional protein. In algal expression system, human PAP was attempted. Preliminary results indicate that some PAP activity was observed when expressed in algal system. Chapter 5 focuses on the investigation of metallo &#946; lactamase (M&#946;L) from Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp-M&#946;L). This enzyme requires one or two Zn2+ ions for catalysis. Kinetic properties of Kp-M&#946;L for the hydrolysis of various &#946;-lactam substrates (e.g. benzyl-penicillin, cefoxitin, imipenem and meropenem) were investigated and the role of the metal ions in catalysis was also examined. Kinetic data demonstrate that Klebsiella pneumoniae M&#946;L can degrade a broad spectrum of &#946;-lactam antibiotics, with a high preference for cephems and carbapenems. Kinetic data from pH dependence studies has revealed that catalysis of benzyl-penicillin and meropenem is preferred at acidic pH. The kcat vs pH profile demonstrates that catalysis is enhanced by protonation, thus it is likely that the relevant group is responsible for the donation of a proton to the product or leaving group. In this case, a doubly Lewis activated, bridging hydroxide molecule has been speculated. A single protonation event (pKa ~7) is also observed in kcat/Km vs pH profile. Since benzyl-penicillin does not have an acidic moiety in this pH range, this event is likely to be associated with the free enzyme. His 79 and 139 have been speculated to enhance substrate binding. In contrast, catalysis of both cefoxitin and imipenem is favoured at alkaline pH, leading to the proposal that a terminally bound water is likely to form a nucleophile. A bell-shaped pH profile for kcat/Km is observed for cefoxitin and imipenem substrates. pKa of ~ 9-9.5 is likely to be associated with Lys161, which enhances substrate binding. In Chapter 6, a novel M&#946;L from Serratia proteamaculans (Spr-M&#946;L) is investigated. This chapter includes expression, purification and preliminary characterization of this M&#946;L using steady-state kinetics. Expression of this enzyme in Rosetta (DE3) plysS E. coli strain yields only a small amount of soluble enzyme (1 mg/ 6 L culture). To improve the amount of soluble protein, Spr-M&#946;L was subjected to several rounds of in vitro evolution. About two-fold gain in solubility was achieved by this method along with a five-fold increase in &#946;-lactamase activity. Further rounds of directed evolution are now planned. The kinetic behaviour for Spr-M&#946;L-catalysed the hydrolysis of three &#946;-lactam substrates, penicillin, cefoxitin and imipenem were also studied. Kinetic data suggest that a water molecule bridging the two Zn2+ ions is the likely nucleophile in the reaction with penicillin while the reaction-initiating nucleophile is likely to be a terminally bound hydroxide in the reaction with cephalothin and imipenem (Chapter 6). In summary, this project has led to a better understanding of the structures of KARI and PAP prior to catalysis. This project has also aided in the understanding of catalytic mechanism of M&#946;Ls and the role the metal ions play. The knowledge gained will facilitate the development of new chemotherapeutics and herbicides.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">purple acid phosphatase, metallo &#946; lactamase, ketol acid reductoisomerase, kinetics, x-ray crystallography, metal dependent enzymes, binuclear metallohydrolases</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205314</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuum diffusion on networks</field><field name="creator">Christophe Haynes</field><field name="description">In this thesis we develop and use a continuum random walk framework to solve problems that are usually studied using a discrete random walk on a discrete lattice. Problems studied include; the time it takes for a random walker to be absorbed at a trap on a fractal lattice, the calculation of the spectral dimension for several different classes of networks, the calculation of the density of states for a multi-layered Bethe lattice and the relationship between diffusion exponents and a resistivity exponent that occur in relevant power laws. The majority of the results are obtained by deriving an expression for a Laplace transformed Green&#8217;s function or first passage time, and then using Tauberian theorems to find the relevant asymptotic behaviour. The continuum framework is established by studying the diffusion equation on a 1-d bar with non-homogeneous boundary conditions. The result is extended to model diffusion on networks through linear algebra. We derive the transformation linking the Green&#8217;s functions and first passage time results in the continuum and discrete settings. The continuum method is used in conjunction with renormalization techniques to calculate the time taken for a random walker to be absorbed at a trap on a fractal lattice and also to find the spectral dimension of new classes of networks. Although these networks can be embedded in the d- dimensional Euclidean plane, they do not have a spectral dimension equal to twice the ratio of the fractal dimension and the random walk dimension when the random walk on the network is transient. The networks therefore violate the Alexander-Orbach law. The fractal Einstein relationship (a relationship relating a diffusion exponent to a resistivity exponent) also does not hold on these networks. Through a suitable scaling argument, we derive a generalised fractal Einstein relationship which holds for our lattices and explains anomalous results concerning transport on diffusion limited aggregates and Eden trees.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Random walk</field><field name="subject">Spectral dimension</field><field name="subject">First passage times</field><field name="subject">Continuum</field><field name="subject">Renormalization</field><field name="subject">Fractal Einstein</field><field name="subject">N- TD trees</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205411</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomimetic Orientated Total Synthesis of Neovibsane Natural Products and Comparison of Synthetic Neovibsanes on Neurite Outgrowth Promotion in PC12 Cells</field><field name="creator">Annette Chen</field><field name="description">Neovibsanin A and B are natural products which induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. They belong in the neovibsane class under the rare vibsane natural product family, whose structures are characterized by polycyclic, polyoxygenated cores. Based on a proposed biosynthesis, the synthetic strategy towards neovibsanin A and B involved synthesizing a key enone intermediate. Initial investigation using this intermediate lead to the total synthesis of 2-O-methylneovibsanin H. Crucial to this concise synthesis was an acid-catalyzed, one-pot, four-step cascade reaction. Modifying the reaction condition leads to a different five-step cascade pathway, resulting in the total synthesis of 4,5-bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B. The synthetic trials and tribulations encountered on the road to these final compounds are explored. It is envisaged that other related neovibsane natural products may arise based on this synthetic sequence. 4,5-Bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B, as well as several other structural analogues collected during the synthesis, were biologically assayed using NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. All compounds induced a significant proportion of neurons to extend neurite processes compared to control cultures.

Plans for metropolitan regions cover large geographic areas, address a wide range of issues, and involve governments and many other organizations. They are prepared and implemented over a long timeframe. Planning for the future of metropolitan regions involves addressing uncertainties about future trends, external events, organisational intentions, political agendas and community values. In this thesis, it is argued that traditional planning approaches that emphasise what is known or thought to be known need to be turned on their head and the focus of planning efforts aimed directly at understanding what is unknown or needs to be known, i.e. at uncertainties. It builds upon concepts of uncertainty from philosophy, economics, planning, management theory and psychology to develop a comprehensive and dynamic conceptual framework for understanding and managing uncertainties in metropolitan planning. Uncertainties are perceived in social processes. The conceptual framework developed in this thesis distinguishes between environmental uncertainties, which are perceived by all people in a community, and process uncertainties, which are perceived by people actively involved in a planning process. The framework identifies five types of uncertainties to be understood and managed in planning: external uncertainties; chance events; causal uncertainties; organisational uncertainties; and value uncertainties. Planning processes envisage and construct alternative futures and each of these alternatives raises different uncertainties. Planning is conceived as a process of exploring alternative futures by visioning and analytical methods and of agreeing on a desired/ planned future and on how to get there. The conceptual framework has been used as a basis for two case studies of the preparation of metropolitan plans: the Livable Region Strategic Plan 1996 for Greater Vancouver, Canada; and the Regional Framework for Growth Management 1995 for South East Queensland, Australia. The case studies show that all five types of uncertainties were perceived by people actively involved in metropolitan planning. The types and level of uncertainties perceived changed through the planning process according to stages in the process, activities in the process and other events. In exploring alternative futures and a desired future, the planning process raises uncertainties and these have to be addressed and dealt with in order to reach agreement about the final plan. The case studies show that uncertainties in plan preparation were dealt with in the following five ways: &#8226; Avoided by deleting these aspects or elements of the desired future; &#8226; Deferred to a later planning process; &#8226; Referred to be dealt with by a different organisation; &#8226; Resolved by additional information collection, agreements or consultation; and &#8226; Retained in the plan and reviewed with the passage of time or contingent events. The studies also show that how uncertainties are managed, and particularly how uncertainties are dealt with in reaching agreement about the planned future, directly affects the nature and contents of the metropolitan plan produced. In this process of reaching agreement, there is a tension between achieving better or achieving more certain outcomes. How agreement occurs is affected by the interests and views of powerful groups in the decision-making process. Overall, the research shows that a focus on uncertainties assists in understanding the planning process and its outputs and that metropolitan planning can be usefully conceived as a process of understanding and managing uncertainties. Based on this research, on planning theories and on risk management models, a framework for understanding and managing uncertainties in metropolitan plan-making is proposed, involving five main stages, namely: &#8226; Initiate the planning process; &#8226; Identify the uncertainties and planning approach; &#8226; Identify the Desired Future; &#8226; Agree on the Planned Future; and &#8226; Implement the plan. The management framework involves specific methods and processes for understanding and managing uncertainties in metropolitan plan-making. The aim of the framework is to agree on a better future for a metropolitan region, compared to the trend, and with more certainty of achievement. The theories or concepts that we use to represent events and their relationships determine the kinds of action we can envisage. In the quest for certainty about better future outcomes for metropolitan regions, this thesis shows that understanding and managing uncertainty provides a powerful guide to action.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">12 Built Environment and Design</field><field name="subject">managing uncertainty</field><field name="subject">metropolitan planning</field><field name="subject">South East Queensland</field><field name="subject">Vancouver</field><field name="subject">planning theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206176</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skeletal Consequences of Crohn's Disease: The Muscle-Bone Relationship</field><field name="creator">Naomi Lee</field><field name="description">Metabolic bone disease is a frequent complication of Crohn&#8217;s disease (CD) with the pathogenesis of reduced bone mass in CD reported to include body weight, disease severity, disease treatments and surgery, physical activity and nutritional status. To date, there have been no studies to examine the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in an Australian CD population. Similarly, the roles of disease state and treatment, lifestyle factors and the role of body composition in the development of bone loss in CD have not been examined in an Australian CD cohort to date. This thesis has sought, for the first time, to determine the prevalence and severity of bone loss in an Australian CD population and to examine the relationship between various clinical, genetic, lifestyle and treatment variables. The role of body composition in bone loss was assessed by close examination of the muscle-bone relationship by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the local muscle-bone unit by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) so that informed targeted treatment strategies may be implemented. Study 1 assessed the prevalence of bone loss and both molecular and clinical risk factors for bone loss in a large Crohn&#8217;s disease population. Bone mineral density (BMD) data were combined with clinical information and correlated with single nucleotide polymorphisms within the TNF-&#945;, interleukin-10, and NOD2/CARD15 genes. Study 2 examined the independent effects of body composition and muscle strength on regional and whole body BMD in a cohort of CD patients to determine their relative importance to bone strength in this population. Study 3 used pQCT for the first time in a CD population to assess the functional muscle-bone unit in order to determine if the high prevalence of low bone mass reported in CD patients is mediated by altered body composition, in particular muscle mass and strength. Study 1 revealed 45% of CD patients had previously been diagnosed with osteopenia and 18% with osteoporosis. Both the TNF-&#945; &#8220;GT&#8221; haplotype and the -857 &#8220;CC&#8221; genotype showed strong associations with bone mineral density overall (p=0.003 and p=0.002, respectively). Body mass index (p=0.01) and previous bowel resection in females (p=0.03) were predictive of a higher spine bone density, whilst body mass index (p=0.003) and the effect of years since first bowel resection (p=0.02) remained independent predictors of proximal femur bone mineral density. When bone mineral density was assessed in Study 2, the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 32% and 17%, respectively, with osteopenia more common at the hip and osteoporosis more common at the spine. In multiple regression analyses, appendicular muscle mass was an independent predictor of whole body and regional BMD while lean mass was an independent predictor at the hip. Neither grip strength nor fat mass were independently associated with BMD. Of the components of body composition, muscle mass was strongly associated with regional and whole body bone mineral density. When the muscle-bone unit was assessed using pQCT in Study 3 to further examine this relationship, CD patients demonstrated lower tibial shaft mass, tibial shaft cortical cross-sectional area, and proximal tibia bone mineral density than similarly aged healthy controls. CD subjects also had significantly lower areal bone mineral density by DXA than controls at the total body (P=0.038) and hip (P=0.019). There were no significant differences between groups for any of the muscle-bone indices assessed, such as bone mineral content/muscle cross-sectional area and bone cross sectional area / muscle strength. Together, these studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of metabolic bone disease in an Australian CD population. We were able to identify a novel protective association between a TNF-&#945; haplotype and bone mineral density and also confirmed the importance of body mass index and intestinal resection on bone loss in this population. Furthermore, these studies indicated that lean mass, and more specifically muscle mass, was a significant independent predictor of regional and whole body BMD. Consequently, maintaining or increasing muscle mass in this patient population may have a positive effect on BMD and prevent the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Although only modest differences were found between CD patients and controls for areal BMD by DXA and some bone parameters by pQCT, there were no differences in indices of the muscle-bone unit. These results suggest that bone strength is adequate for muscle size and strength in our sample of male CD patients with well-controlled disease, inferring that no specific intervention is required to correct expected deficiencies in this relationship. Instead, an exercise training program introduced to this patient cohort should aim to maintain or increase bone mass through weight-bearing exercises as well as encourage the maintenance or increase in muscle mass.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</field><field name="subject">Crohn's Disease</field><field name="subject">Body Composition</field><field name="subject">Muscle-Bone Relationship</field><field name="subject">Muscle Force</field><field name="subject">Bone Strength</field><field name="subject">Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)</field><field name="subject">Muscle-Bone Index</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206199</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the farming community, the Lockyer Valley, Queensland</field><field name="creator">Oo, Khin</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in two shires of Laidley and Gatton in the Lockyer Valley in 1986. The research method used was a self-administered mail questionnaire sent to four hundred primary producers. The response rate received was 49.5 percent which is quite reasonable for a random sample of a non-specific interest group. The study area was divided into six zones based on the 198 respondents&#8217; assessment of the enterprise from which they derived major income. The main approach of this project was a situational analysis o the Lockyer Valley. Central to this research was identification of the pressure and extent of problems relating to several aspects of land use, notably soil erosion, weed infestation; availability and quality of water and more general community-based problems. The characteristics of farm households, the role of family members in decision-making and tasks related to farm as well as home, were also included in this study. The Lockyer Valley is a major production area of vegetables as well as a mixed farming area. Natural pasture, which was extensively found in Zone 6, was largely used for cattle grazing. Generally, rural women were better educated than their husbands, and the ratio of educational level of husband and wife was higher than previous research findings. A large number of producers and their wives have taken off-farm work, and women tended to spend more time in off-farm employment. Only 6.1 percent of producers&#8217; children had completed tertiary education and the majority of all sons were working on the farm. Partnership was found to be the major type of property ownership and inter-generational transfer of the property was the future plan. The producers who were from a non-farm upbringing and who had already taken up off-farm work intended to leave their properties at some time in the future. With the running of the farm business , 35 percent of rural women worked full-time in partnership with their husbands, and 42 percent worked part-time. However, 23 percent of rural women were homemakers and were not involved in running the farm business. The association between decision-making of husband and wife and situational factors such as ownership, involvement in farm tasks, record-keeping, education, on-farm upbringing and age were analysed. Joint involvement of wives in decision-making was to be related to ownership, farm tasks and record-keeping. However, husbands were more likely to take a major role in decision-making if they were more educated and had an on-farm upbringing. Age was found to be a factor affecting joint decision-making, although this result conflicted with findings of earlier research. The opinions of the farm community in identifying the problems of the specific small area in the Lockyer Valley were revealed. Lantana was the most severe weed problem in the whole catchment. The catchment area also had problems with wattle. The recommended control method of lantana was replacement by improved pasture, but it was adopted by few primary producers. Soil erosion in the form of gullies, bank erosion, sheet erosion, salinity and flooding were some of the problems perceived by the local community. Regular &#8216;slash and burn&#8217; was practised by most of the producers. This is one of the causes of land degradation. Bore, creek and river, and dam were the main water sources for farm supply and irrigation. Only 60 percent of bored had adequate water supply and good water quality. Farm dam and creek/river sources were less reliable due to the inadequate availability of water. Consequently, operators at about half the cropped farms had to stop growing some vegetables which were previously commercially successful. Within the context of farm family needs, emphasis was placed on conservation of water, because of the erosion and water problems. The community&#8217;s opinion on community development activities emphasised the involvement of farm families. Finally, suggestions for the extension program which should be emphasised on rural development by means of community participation were included. The bases for further studies was also provided in this report.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">070101 Agricultural Land Management</field><field name="subject">070102 Agricultural Land Planning</field><field name="subject">0701 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management</field><field name="subject">Lockyer Valley</field><field name="subject">farming communities</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">primary producers</field><field name="subject">farm management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211168</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Covalent immobilisation of proteins for biomaterial and biosensing applications</field><field name="creator">Szili, Endre Jozsef</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on surface science and bioengineering investigations, first for the development of an improved biomaterial for orthopaedic implant applications, and second, for the development of a biosensor device for biomedical diagnostics. A key component considered in this thesis was the covalent linkage of proteins to the material&#146;s surface for retaining the protein&#146;s immunological and biological activities and for generating a functional interface. 

Part 1 of this thesis investigated surface modification procedures for improving the bioactivity of titanium substrates. Titanium is first coated with a bioactive silica film grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), referred to as PECVD-Si-Ti. In previous studies, the bone-implant integration process was enhanced 1.6-fold for titanium implants coated with PECVD-Si films compared to uncoated titanium implants in vivo. However, in vitro studies carried out in this thesis showed that the growth of MG63 osteoblast-like cells was 7-fold higher on uncoated titanium compared to PECVD-Si coated titanium. Therefore, to improve cell growth on the surface and, by inference, the integration of PECVD-Si-Ti implants into bone tissue, the implant&#146;s surface was functionalised with a mitogenic factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This was accomplished by modifying the PECVD-Si-Ti surface with an alkoxysilane, 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane (IPTES), and then by covalent bioconjugation of IGF-1 through isocyanate-amino chemistry. After 72 h of in vitro cell culture in serum-free medium, the growth of MG63 cells was enhanced 1.9-fold on IPTES functionalised PECVD-Si-Ti, which was loaded with covalently immobilised IGF-1 compared to IPTES functionalised PECVD-Si-Ti without IGF-1 (isocyanate reactive groups were quenched with ethanolamine hydrochloride). The attachment and adhesion of MG63 cells were also enhanced on PECVD-Si-Ti by the covalently immobilised IGF-1 in serum-free cell culture conditions. Therefore, the bioactivity of PECVD-Si-Ti was improved by covalently linking IGF-1 to the substrate surface through isocyanate-amino chemistry.

Part 2 of this thesis involved the development of a new optical interferometric biosensor. The biosensor platform was constructed from electrochemically-prepared thin films of porous silicon that acted as a sensing matrix and transducer element. By reflective interferometry using white light, an enzyme-catalysed reaction was discovered (horseradish peroxidase (HRP) mediated oxidation of 3,3&#146;,5,5&#146;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)), which led to an acceleration in the rate of porous silicon corrosion and represented the biosensor&#146;s readout signal. We discovered that another substrate, which is also oxidised by HRP, OPD, produces an even more pronounced readout signal. The HRP-OPD system was used in an immunoassay for detecting human IgG from an Intragam solution. An important part in the design of the biosensor was the surface functionalisation approach where anti-human IgG, referred to as the capture antibody, is immobilised on the porous silicon surface. The readout signal (produced from the capture of human IgG) was enhanced 4-fold on the porous silicon biosensing platform functionalised with covalently linked anti-human IgG through isocyanate-amino chemistry compared to the porous silicon biosensing platform functionalised with adsorbed anti-human IgG. The optimised biosensor was used to detect IgG from a total human protein concentration of Intragam to a sensitivity of 100 ng/ml.

In summary, isocyanate-amino bioconjugate chemistry was used to covalently link either IGF-1 to PECVD-Si-Ti for improving the biological activity of the orthopaedic implant and to covalently link IgG to porous silicon for developing a sensitive biosensor for the detection of proteins. This surface chemistry approach is very useful for biomaterial and biosensing applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomaterial</field><field name="subject">plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD)</field><field name="subject">biosensor</field><field name="subject">titanium</field><field name="subject">osteoblast</field><field name="subject">bioconjugation</field><field name="subject">IGF-1</field><field name="subject">IgG</field><field name="subject">porous silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080724.214815</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saving soldiers the evolution of international military medical norms, 1815 to 1914</field><field name="creator">Jessica Jane Ellis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151443</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of whiteness in Australia: Discourses of immigration and national identity from the White Australia Policy to multiculturalism</field><field name="creator">Ganley, Nathan Tobias</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Australia policy -- History</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specification-based testing of interactive systems</field><field name="creator">Dr Ian Maccoll</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">formal specications, software testing, interactive systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159510</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Population Ecology of Manta Birostris in Southern Mozambique</field><field name="creator">Andrea Denise Marshall</field><field name="description">Despite being the world&#8217;s largest batoid fish, manta rays have been the focus of very little research in the last century. Almost nothing is currently known about their ecology or distribution throughout the world&#8217;s oceans. Manta rays are considered to be near-threatened to vulnerable by the World Conservation Union&#8217;s Redlist of endangered species, yet many populations still face threats from target fishing for their fin cartilage, branchial filaments and meat. The taxonomic history of the genus Manta has been questionable and convoluted,with Manta having one of the most extensive generic and species synonymies of any living genus of cartilaginous fish. Currently this genus is considered to be monotypicwith a single recognized species, Manta birostris. Behavioural and morphological data collected during this study showed that there are two distinct, sympatric species of manta ray in Mozambique. This discovery has led to an examination of manta ray distribution worldwide, with the two species hypothesis receiving further support from study sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This thesis examined large populations of both putative species in Mozambique. Development and application of a photographic-identification methodology allowed identification of individuals based on their unique ventral surface markings (spots). The ability to recognise individuals enabled many aspects of both populations to be examined. A total of 449 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant A and 101 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant B. Both populations exhibited a highly significant female bias in observed sex ratios of 1:3.5 and 1:7.4 respectively. The photographic identification approach was used in studies of population size and structure and to examine the reproductive ecology of these two distinct populations. Population estimates incorporating four years of re-sighting data on Manta birostris variant A and five years of data on Manta birostris variant B were conducted using the program MARK resulting in super population estimates of 890 and 600 individuals respectively. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for Manta birostris variant A based on observations of mating events and fresh pectoral fin tip scars on female rays produced when the male rays bite onto the fins during copulation. The distribution of scars was highly biased, with 99% on the left pectoral fin, indicative of a strong lateralised behavioural trait in this species. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralisation. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals giving birth in the summer after a gestation period of approximately one year. Reproductive periodicity in M. birostris variant A was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were seen to be pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed in fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Morphometric analysis of late-term foetus (M. birostris variant A) was contrasted with measurements taken from adult rays. These are the only detailed measurements on M. birostris variant A from the western Indian Ocean. Predatory scarring and bite injuries on individuals of both variant A and B were consistent with attacks from sharks of various sizes. The frequency and effect of these predatory injuries on the two populations were examined over a three-year period. Acoustic tags were attached to fourteen rays and their presence/absence at sites around the major inshore reefs was explored to evaluate how the rays utilised their environment on a temporal scale. Cleaning activity of both putative species of manta rays by small fishes occurred on these reefs and was considered to be the main reason why the rays were present at these sites. Parasite removal and wound healing were implicated as the benefits received. Host cleaner fish species partition the manta ray body to avoid interspecific competition while the two putative species appear to partition cleaning habitats, with very little overlap apparent. This research on manta rays is the first of its kind in African waters. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this genus. The study additionally provided sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the separation of these two putative species of Manta and a full revision of the genus with the systematic examination of specimens throughout Manta&#8217;s range. The results of this study may be useful in this endeavour as diagnostic characteristics have been isolated that may help to differentiate members of this genus. The results of this research study are directly applicable to management strategies for both putative species of manta rays off the East Coast of Africa as well as populations worldwide and have highlighted the potential need for different conservation strategies</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elasmobranch, Manta ray, Population biology, Taxonomy, Morphology, Reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160974</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactivity Grafting of Cyclic Peptides: Structure Activity Studies of Grafted Cyclotides and SFTI-1</field><field name="creator">Sunithi Gunasekera</field><field name="description">Peptides are considered as drugs of the future because of their advantageous features of high specificity and low toxicity. However, the complete therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized because of the in vivo instability displayed by most potential peptides. In this thesis, two naturally derived cyclic peptides, cyclotides and sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1), were utilized to impart stability to linear bioactive epitopes and enhance their therapeutic potential in a biological environment. Cyclotides are plant derived mini-proteins with compact folded structures and exceptional stability. Their stability derives from a head-to-tail cyclised backbone coupled with a cystine knot arrangement of three-conserved disulfide bonds. Sunflower typsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) is a stable cyclic peptide containing a single disulfide bond. Taking advantage of these stable cyclic peptide frameworks, novel drug leads to inhibit/stimulate angiogenesis were developed by using the approach of &#8216;epitope grafting&#8217; in which linear epitopes were grafted onto the cyclic peptide frameworks. Angiogenesis is a physiological condition that is unregulated in the progression of many diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Thus the drug leads designed in the current project have potential therapeutic applications to combat cancers and cardiovascular diseases. To fully exploit cyclotides as drug scaffolds, it is imperative to understand their folding. Two main subfamilies, referred to as the M&#246;bius and bracelet cyclotides have been identified and interestingly, they require dramatically different in vitro folding conditions to achieve formation of the conserved cyclic cystine knot motif. To determine the underlying structural elements that influence cyclotide folding, the in vitro folding of a suite of hybrid cyclotides based on combination of the M&#246;bius cyclotide kalata B1 and the bracelet cyclotide cycloviolacin O1 was examined in this thesis. The pathways of folding of the two cyclotide subfamilies were found to be different and primarily dictated by specific residues harboured within inter-cysteine loops 2 and 6. Two changes in these loops, an amino acid substitution in loop 2 and an amino acid addition in loop 6 enabled the folding of cycloviolacin O1 under conditions where folding does not occur in vitro for the native peptide. Thus, the study identified key residues that are not in close proximity in the primary sequence or three-dimensional structure which assist folding in cyclotides. A key intermediate species in the folding pathway was isolated and characterised, and found to contain a native-like hairpin structure that appears to be a nucleation locus early in the folding process. The intermediate does not have native disulfide connectivities, but disulfide shuffling processes ultimately lead to a rearrangement to the native form. Overall these mechanistic findings on the folding of cyclotides are potentially valuable for protein engineering applications that utilize cystine-rich peptides as scaffolds in the design of new drug leads. The current study has also enabled the extention of the grafting studies to the bracelet cyclotide subfamily, which was intractable to grafting prior to this work. Cyclotides are gene encoded macrocyclic proteins and another way to exploit their potential as drug scaffolds, would be to develop combinatorial cyclotide libraries. The most efficient way to generate engineered cyclotides would be via recombinant expression, which currently remains unsuccessful, partly due to lack of understanding of the mechanism of cyclotide backbone cyclization. Understanding how the cyclotide precursor folds may provide clues to how cyliclization occurs. A conserved region known as the N-terminal repeat (NTR) region in the cyclotide precursor has been speculated to play an important role in precursor folding. In this thesis, the function of the NTR in the folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro was examined via the design of a series of constructs for the precursor protein for the prototypic kalata B1 cyclotide, with incremental additions of the NTR region. Analysis of the constructs by NMR spectroscopy for evidence of secondary structure revealed that the NTR does not assist folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro. Using diffusion NMR, the unstructured nature of the constructs was localized to the NTR region. In a complementary study, structural analysis of the full length cyclotide precursor was carried out by expressing the precursor gene for kalata B1 in a bacterial expression system. The full-length precursor was found to be unstructured in solution despite approximately half of the precursor comprising the mature domain and NTR, both of which are structured in isolation. The unstructured nature of the cyclotide precursor suggested that a different environment, or indeed interaction of the NTR with a particular enzyme involved in processing, is necessary for it to adopt a well-defined conformation and allow processing to produce the mature circular protein. The information that NTR alone may not assist folding of the cyclotide precursors has provided new impetus to examine the role of other potential folding auxiliaries such as protein disulfide isomerase in cyclotide folding and has indirectly advanced the production of cyclotides via transgenic means. In summary, this thesis has provided a fundamental insight into the folding of cyclotides, both when expressed as part of a precursor protein and in isolation via solid phase chemical synthesis, and has exploited the potential of cyclic peptide scaffolds in drug design applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cyclotides</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">Grafting</field><field name="subject">Peptides</field><field name="subject">Drug design</field><field name="subject">Folding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165426</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpretive and Source-Oriented Approaches: Modern Japanese Free Verse Poetry in English Translation</field><field name="creator">William Fryer</field><field name="description">This study examines two translation approaches prominent among English translations of modern Japanese free verse poetry. The purpose is twofold: to provide a critical history of the first book-length English translations of individual poets, published over roughly a ten-year period; and to identify and examine, among those publications, works that took a distinctive and challenging translation approach. The main argument is that the chief works examined in this study each present a differing approach that challenges the dominant postwar discourse on translation in the Japanese literary studies community. The study fills a conspicuous gap in translation studies, since it is the first in-depth examination of modern Japanese poetry in translation. It focuses on two translation approaches, specifically &#8220;interpretive&#8221; and &#8220;source-oriented&#8221; translation, which have tended to be loosely associated with the vague notions of &#8220;free&#8221; translation and &#8220;literal&#8221; translation respectively. The importance of the study stems from its clarified definitions of these approaches through analyses of published translations featuring their rigorous use. It also suggests arguments for and implications of using and identifying these approaches, both for the translator and for translation scholars. Modern poetry was chosen as a genre because it features the two approaches prominently and because it was felt important to focus on a genre somewhat marginalised among publications of Japanese literature in translation. The study focuses in particular on translations published in the period 1968-1978, because this represented a flowering period of publications of modern Japanese poetry, including the first book-length publications of individual poets. Chapter One has two parts: definitions and contexts. The definitions section is a brief discussion of translation theory focusing on views that have gone beyond the &#8220;literal&#8221; versus &#8220;free&#8221; argument, and it examines a number of significant statements in the field of translations studies in order to develop useful definitions of key terms used throughout the study. The second half contextualises the significance of the chosen publications in the Japanese literary studies community. This includes a brief history of translation and translation theory focusing on the views of the dominant translators in the early postwar years, including discussions, disagreements or criticisms concerning the &#8220;right&#8221; way to translate. It also includes an analysis of attitudes towards modern poetry among scholars and translators of Japanese literature and a brief discussion of translations of modern Japanese poetry. Chapter Two examines poet Gary Snyder&#8217;s interpretive and transformative translations of Miyazawa Kenji&#8217;s (1896-1933) poems &#8220;Haru to shura&#8221; (Spring and Asura) and &#8220;Nusubito&#8221; (The Thief). The chapter shows how Snyder&#8217;s renditions of these poems can be related to the structure and themes of his own poetry collection The Back Country (1968) in which the translations appeared. By throwing his interpretive reading of these poems into the translations, as well as making some creative adjustments, Snyder allows the translations to fit within the thematic movement of his own collection. This chapter also argues that the act of identifying interpretive approaches in the case of poet-translators can be an an important tool in establishing links between the translations and the poet&#8217;s original literary works, and even further links with the poet&#8217;s life and philosophy. Chapter Three examines Hiroaki Sato&#8217;s translations of Hagiwara Sakutar&#333; (1886-1942) in Howling at the Moon (1978). Sato takes an estranging, source-oriented approach similar to Lawrence Venuti&#8217;s concept of &#8220;foreignisation&#8221;, an approach that signals the difference of the source text and culture by departing from accepted language usage. With Sato&#8217;s translations we can observe the estranging effect of the source-oriented approach working in two directions: suggesting the difference of source text syntax from the target language perspective; and giving an equivalent effect of some unusual language use that was already estranging for source language readers. Sato sees the estranging function of Sakutar&#333;&#8217;s syntax as an essential element of his poetry, and has developed his whole translation strategy around this view. Chapter Four discusses Cid Corman and Kamaike Susumu&#8217;s translations of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems in frogs &amp;. others. (1969). As with Sato&#8217;s versions of Sakutar&#333;, Corman and Kamaike take a source-oriented approach, and their clever use of text selection and ordering as translation strategies has enabled them to convey their interpretation of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems as directing a defamiliarising gaze back at humans and human society. Rather than aiming for complete linguistic accuracy as Sato does, they focus on a mirror-image source-oriented approach&#8212;often reproducing the source text&#8217;s word order and line order&#8212;not only as a means to suggest Kusano&#8217;s syntax, but also as a form of language experimentation and wordplay that enables their translations to stand out as autonomous poetic texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">modern</field><field name="subject">free verse</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">Miyazawa Kenji</field><field name="subject">Hagiwara Sakutar&#333;</field><field name="subject">Kusano Shinpei</field><field name="subject">Literature in Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185287</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First language influence on second language syntactic processing of English relative clauses</field><field name="creator">Ken-ichi Hashimoto</field><field name="description">Fluent sentence comprehension requires the automatic application of grammatical principles, in combination with other kinds of information, to a linear input string. The latter can vary greatly in complexity, and it has been observed that structures that involve non-adjacent relationships (non-local dependencies) cause particular processing difficulties, for even fluent readers. This thesis focuses on the potential role that L1 transfer plays in processing non-local dependencies in the L2. Although L1 transfer has been demonstrated in a variety of L2 domains (Juffs, 2005), the degree to which L1 syntactic properties influence the L2 in real-time processing remains an open question (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). A better understanding of L1 influence on L2 processing has important implications for emerging models of L2 sentence processing and SLA theory in general. This thesis examines L1 effects on the processing of L2 English relative clauses. It builds on established models of L1 relative clause processing (e.g., Gibson, 1998) and focuses on the asymmetry observed in the processing of subject versus object relative clauses. Research has shown that L1 individuals find object relative clauses more difficult to process than their subject counterparts (King &amp; Just, 1991), and off-line L2 research suggests that this asymmetry might hold for L2 processing as well (Izumi, 2003; Kanno, 2007). This thesis will examine the asymmetry on-line and investigate the role that L1 background plays in on-line performance, both alone and in combination with other processing factors. The main data are on-line performance by three groups of advanced-level learners of L2 English from Japan, China, and Vietnam. The three L1s differ from English to varying degrees in relative clause formation, as reflected in head direction, branching direction and the presence of an overt relative marker. Vietnamese shares all three properties with English and Japanese none, leading to the prediction that the Japanese learners will have the greatest difficulty, as evident in the largest subject/object asymmetry in processing times. Evidence for the effect of L1 syntactic properties on L2 processing will be sought in a set of studies that compare processing outcomes for these learners across key individual difference factors in L2 processing, working memory capacity, lexical processing efficiency, and proficiency. The effect of non-structural information, in the form of animacy contrasts and frequency effects, on L2 syntactic processing across the L1 groups will also be examined. By systematically examining group differences across these key factors, the degree and nature of potential L1 influence on the processing of these non-local dependencies can be better assessed. Three groups of advanced-level L2 English learners from China, Japan, and Vietnam, a group of intermediate-level learners in Japan, and native English controls participated in the data collection. Participants were first tested on a battery of individual difference measures that established language proficiency and general processing skill for individual participants and groups. On-line reading data of relative clause structures were then collected and reported in a set of five studies. Study 1 examined reading when the target structures contained high frequency content words, which minimized word recognition demands. Advanced L2 learners took longer to read object relative clauses, and the difference was the greatest for the Japanese group. Study 2 revealed that the subject/object asymmetry and L1 influence evident in Study 1 disappeared when word recognition was effortful, as in sentences with low frequency words, suggesting that L1 syntactic influence may only be evident when lexical processing is relatively automatic. Study 3 examined the effect of proficiency differences on processing outcomes by comparing performance by Intermediate and Advanced Japanese learners. The Intermediate learners showed no subject/object asymmetry in sentences with high frequency words, providing further evidence that processing efficiency is a key factor when considering possible L1 effects in L2 processing. Study 4 demonstrated that advanced L2 learners benefited from animacy cues in on-line processing, with the difficulty associated with object relative sentences and the L1 effect evident in sentences with animate head nouns neutralized in sentences with inanimate head nouns. The findings indicate that L2 learners may rely on lexical information as an alternative to syntactic knowledge in some cases. Finally, Study 5 compared processing performance on full or reduced relative clauses to examine both the influence of L1 syntactic properties and L1 structural frequency biases on L2 processing outcomes. Although the influence of frequency information was not evident, the results suggested that the availability of an overt relative marker in the L1 affected L2 processing outcomes. Overall, the results provide some support for the view that L1 background influences the processing of complex syntactic structures in the L2, a finding consistent with Juffs (2005) but contrary to Clahsen et al. (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). However, the effect is sensitive to a range of factors, which appears to support the claim by the latter that L2 learners may rely more on lexical-semantic information than L1 individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relative clause</field><field name="subject">syntactic processing</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer</field><field name="subject">L2 processing</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">word recognition</field><field name="subject">proficiency</field><field name="subject">animacy</field><field name="subject">structural frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reverse Logistics and Information Management Issues in Manufacturing and E-Business Industries</field><field name="creator">Dissanayake, K.D. Dushantha Nimal</field><field name="description">Reverse logistics is different from forward logistics in objectives, operations, pricing, quality, quantity, packaging, product and information flow. Further, management of the returned products and their information is a major challenge since it is difficult to predict the time, place of origin, quantity and quality of the goods that will be returned. To establish the importance of reverse logistics as a business process and to understand related issues for information management, this research was undertaken with data from the Australian Manufacturing and E-Business organisations.       This research examined six dimensions of reverse logistics. These were: (1) Factors that compel Manufacturing and E-Business organisations to manage reverse logistics; (2) Operations in product return process; (3) Methods of capturing value from returned goods; (4) Barriers to reverse logistics management; (5) Information management issues in reverse logistics; and (6) Product return trends in the E-Business industry.      This research was exploratory in nature and was accomplished via a quantitative research method. It adopted a positivist epistemology and followed a deductive approach to capture reverse logistics knowledge. Research data from Manufacturing and E-Business industries was elicited with postal questionnaire surveys using structured questions.         Since the data collected from the two main surveys was mainly nominal and ordinal, it was quantitatively analysed using non-parametric tests, Fisher's exact test and one sample Wilcoxon test. It also employed frequency distributions, binomial test and one sample t-test. An additional statistical test was carried out on each set of data to triangulate the finding. The tests were undertaken in Minitab spreadsheet computer packages.      This research highlights the fact that reverse logistics management is an important business process in the Australian Manufacturing and E-Business industries. It is a strategic advantage, as well as an important customer service. Although substantial monetary value can be recovered from returned goods, at present two industries investigated have not tapped into this potential.        Findings of this research also indicate that a lack of efficient information management is a problem in reverse logistics. Information management in the two industries is based on land-line telephone, fax and computers.        This research identified that from E-Business sales error in ordering, customer change of mind on receipt of good and inefficient forward logistics operations (picking, packing and delivery) are important reasons for returns. It also established that e-businesses resell the returned goods and recapture value. The value recovery process in this industry is different from the manufacturing industries where the prevalent value recovery processes are repair, resale and recycle.       Further research issues emanating from this project include evaluation methods for recapturing value from returned goods, effective information management strategies for return management and the impact of a law for returning certain types of used goods.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using scenario planning to identify potential impacts of socio-demographic change on aspects of domestic tourism demand in Queensland in 2021</field><field name="creator">Glover, Petra Sabine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism -- Supply and demand -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158465</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aid Effectiveness and Health: Challenges, Tensions and Opportunities</field><field name="creator">Rebecca Dodd</field><field name="description">Provision of aid has long been influenced by the political priorities of donors, and there is substantial evidence that the administrative rules and regulations of donor organisations create problems for recipient countries. For as long as this fact has been understood, there have been efforts to address it: most recently, spear-headed by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and its associated efforts. This thesis seeks to deepen understanding of this tension by examining the aid relationships in the health sector using analytical frameworks drawn from governance, political economy and health policy. Part 1 &#8216;defines the territory&#8217; by describing the aid effectiveness challenges faced in the sector in qualitative and quantitative terms. Part 2 seeks to understand why these challenges persist by examining the political and institutional forces which affect provision of aid from (following Reich) &#8216;above, within and below&#8217;. I begin by looking at the &#8216;high&#8217; political forces affecting aid provision by locating health aid as an instrument of international relations. Then, I look in greater detail the central tension in governance of health aid: the &#8216;push&#8217; and &#8216;pull&#8217; between efforts to promote greater coherence and the reality of diversity. Finally, I explore the internal (institutional) forces within aid agencies which affect a particular dimension of aid provision: the length of donor commitments. Part 3 presents in-depth case study research which demonstrates how the political forces from above, within and below play out in practice. The emerging conclusion is that the aid effectiveness agenda, as set out in the Paris Declaration, is only ever likely to be partially successful, for two reasons. First, because global health governance is inherently iterative, dynamic and diverse it cannot be regulated through further global processes (such as aid effectiveness). Second, the aid effectiveness agenda is structured around simple concepts and solutions which (while useful for global advocacy purposes) are no match for the political, institutional and economic complexity which characterises the aid relationship at country level. Indeed, the diversity that global health creates at country level has to be managed by recipient countries themselves, according to their timetable, and in a way tailored to their own context and circumstances.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Development Assistance</field><field name="subject">Health policy</field><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204198</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and Managing Uncertainty in Metropolitan Planning</field><field name="creator">Michael John Abbott</field><field name="description">Metropolitan regions around the world are growing rapidly and face a complex and uncertain future. Plans for metropolitan regions cover large geographic areas, address a wide range of issues, and involve governments and many other organizations. They are prepared and implemented over a long timeframe. Planning for the future of metropolitan regions involves addressing uncertainties about future trends, external events, organisational intentions, political agendas and community values. In this thesis, it is argued that traditional planning approaches that emphasise what is known or thought to be known need to be turned on their head and the focus of planning efforts aimed directly at understanding what is unknown or needs to be known, i.e. at uncertainties. It builds upon concepts of uncertainty from philosophy, economics, planning, management theory and psychology to develop a comprehensive and dynamic conceptual framework for understanding and managing uncertainties in metropolitan planning. Uncertainties are perceived in social processes. The conceptual framework developed in this thesis distinguishes between environmental uncertainties, which are perceived by all people in a community, and process uncertainties, which are perceived by people actively involved in a planning process. The framework identifies five types of uncertainties to be understood and managed in planning: external uncertainties; chance events; causal uncertainties; organisational uncertainties; and value uncertainties. Planning processes envisage and construct alternative futures and each of these alternatives raises different uncertainties. Planning is conceived as a process of exploring alternative futures by visioning and analytical methods and of agreeing on a desired/ planned future and on how to get there. The conceptual framework has been used as a basis for two case studies of the preparation of metropolitan plans: the Livable Region Strategic Plan 1996 for Greater Vancouver, Canada; and the Regional Framework for Growth Management 1995 for South East Queensland, Australia. The case studies show that all five types of uncertainties were perceived by people actively involved in metropolitan planning. The types and level of uncertainties perceived changed through the planning process according to stages in the process, activities in the process and other events. In exploring alternative futures and a desired future, the planning process raises uncertainties and these have to be addressed and dealt with in order to reach agreement about the final plan. The case studies show that uncertainties in plan preparation were dealt with in the following five ways: &#8226; Avoided by deleting these aspects or elements of the desired future; &#8226; Deferred to a later planning process; &#8226; Referred to be dealt with by a different organisation; &#8226; Resolved by additional information collection, agreements or consultation; and &#8226; Retained in the plan and reviewed with the passage of time or contingent events. The studies also show that how uncertainties are managed, and particularly how uncertainties are dealt with in reaching agreement about the planned future, directly affects the nature and contents of the metropolitan plan produced. In this process of reaching agreement, there is a tension between achieving better or achieving more certain outcomes. How agreement occurs is affected by the interests and views of powerful groups in the decision-making process. Overall, the research shows that a focus on uncertainties assists in understanding the planning process and its outputs and that metropolitan planning can be usefully conceived as a process of understanding and managing uncertainties. Based on this research, on planning theories and on risk management models, a framework for understanding and managing uncertainties in metropolitan plan-making is proposed, involving five main stages, namely: &#8226; Initiate the planning process; &#8226; Identify the uncertainties and planning approach; &#8226; Identify the Desired Future; &#8226; Agree on the Planned Future; and &#8226; Implement the plan. The management framework involves specific methods and processes for understanding and managing uncertainties in metropolitan plan-making. The aim of the framework is to agree on a better future for a metropolitan region, compared to the trend, and with more certainty of achievement. The theories or concepts that we use to represent events and their relationships determine the kinds of action we can envisage. In the quest for certainty about better future outcomes for metropolitan regions, this thesis shows that understanding and managing uncertainty provides a powerful guide to action.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">12 Built Environment and Design</field><field name="subject">managing uncertainty</field><field name="subject">metropolitan planning</field><field name="subject">South East Queensland</field><field name="subject">Vancouver</field><field name="subject">planning theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206176</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Healing architecture': A study of daylight in public hospital designs in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Srazali Aripin</field><field name="description">In the hospital building, where patients seek medical treatment and hospital staff provide continuous support, creating a healing environment is an imperative. However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are Words with Effector Specific Motor Related Meaning Represented Somatotopically on the Motor Cortex?</field><field name="creator">Natasha Postle</field><field name="description">Traditionally, language was proposed to be mediated by various left hemisphere perisylvian structures and the associated role of the motor cortices was limited to tasks such as articulation. Recent theoretical models have proposed that effector specific words with motor related meaning are represented somatotopically on the primary motor (Brodmann&#8217;s Area 4) and premotor (Brodmann&#8217;s Area 6) cortices. For example, it has been reported that when verbs associated with the hand (e.g., pick) are processed, the primary and premotor areas involved with moving the hand are engaged. However, fundamental methodological problems exist within the reported research. This thesis aimed to address and correct the inconsistencies and methodological limitations within the existing literature to provide more conclusive evidence regarding the involvement of the primary and premotor cortices in processing verbs with motor related meaning. This thesis also aimed to investigate whether the names of effectors (nouns) also involve processing by the motor cortices, either generally or somatotopically. Three behavioural dual task experiments and one fMRI experiment were conducted. Results indicated no evidence of somatotopically organised overlapping activation in the primary or premotor cortex between the various semantic categories of words and related effector movements. However, in the fMRI experiment, motor related verbs in general yielded significant overlapping activity between reading all effector related verbs and moving all effectors in the pre-supplementary motor area of the premotor cortex. These findings indicate that an embodied language involving somatotopic representations of effector specific verbs on the primary or premotor cortex is unlikely to be the case. Rather there appears to be a more general representation of effector related verbs in a more cognitive than motor area of the premotor cortex. The findings of this thesis are consistent a wealth of evidence supporting the motor cortices being generally associated with motor related language and with the idea that semantic representations are distributed throughout the brain according to the embodied cognitive framework, rather than being localised to amodal regions that process all words.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Motor Cortex</field><field name="subject">Somatotopy</field><field name="subject">Language Comprehension</field><field name="subject">Verbs</field><field name="subject">Nouns</field><field name="subject">Dual Task</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Effector Specific</field><field name="subject">Motor Related Meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207865</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Stories of Ex-Prisoners with Intellectual Disability in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ellem</field><field name="description">Disability advocates in the twenty-first century have frowned upon the practice of institutionalization in disability services, yet many people with intellectual disability continue to be institutionalized in other settings such as correctional facilities. The prison system is a difficult environment for people with intellectual disability to negotiate, and they may find themselves victimized, segregated and isolated with very few resources to survive the experience. Incarceration may present a temporary solution to preventing anti-social behaviour in society. However, for offenders with intellectual disability, it often fails to address their criminal behaviour or the social context from which the behaviour emanates. Policy and practice in the disability service sector needs to develop further awareness of the needs of people with intellectual disability who come into contact with the criminal justice system as offenders. Similarly, correctional systems need to expand their knowledge base on the habilitative and rehabilitative needs of prisoners with intellectual disability in order to better address the issues that may arise from their incarceration. This exploratory qualitative study gathers the life stories of ten ex-prisoners from Queensland correctional facilities who have been labelled as having an intellectual disability by the service systems they have accessed. It utilizes an interpretive, social constructionist framework to understand people&#8217;s experiences. Life stories were gathered from in-depth interviews with participants over a prolonged period of time and supplemented by contextual information provided by six practitioners from disability, mental health and ex-prisoner services. The stories of three participants with intellectual disability were analysed through the holistic lens of a narrative approach and all ten stories were analysed thematically, providing an aggregate picture of all participants&#8217; experiences. The findings of this thesis indicate that participants in this study had personal needs to belong, to feel competent and for others to see their criminal activity as an unfortunate but very human response to difficult circumstances. These needs were not always met within the prison environment and many participants struggled to feel safe in such a context. There were many pre-prison characteristics of participants that influenced their adaptation to prison, and they were also subjected to a series of degradations such as enforced isolation, frequent strip-searching, verbal and physical assault. However, these factors were not always constructed as negative or significant experiences by participants, and were often counterbalanced by perceived benefits to prison life such as friendship, food and reprieve from community living. These constructions of their experience highlight the vulnerability of this group within the prison environment and the failure of 2 the system and broader society to address core issues for people when they returned to the community. Significant disparities were also found between the philosophies of disability service support and the correctional enterprise. This study has indicated the urgent need for cross-agency collaboration in addressing the needs of people with intellectual disability. The thesis makes a contribution to both doing research with people with intellectual disability and to understanding their experiences of incarceration. The voices of people with intellectual disability have long been overlooked in research because it was assumed they could not express their views or because researchers did not have appropriate research approaches. It is only recently that some writers have captured the viewpoints of people with intellectual disability in academic discourse, but there has been little work done with prisoners and ex-prisoners with intellectual disability. Researching the experience of imprisonment with people with intellectual disabilities also presented unique ethical and methodological challenges. This thesis covers ethical issues such as informed consent, incriminating disclosure, self-determination and veracity and bias in life story research. It also develops knowledge in this area regarding recruitment, communication practices, and dissemination of findings. Overall, the study provides a nuanced account of life inside prison for people with intellectual disability. It makes a valuable contribution to the field of inclusive research with people with impaired capacity and to criminological research in this area.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">imprisonment, community re-entry, intellectual disability, life story research, Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207877</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion of the Concept of Sustainable Tourism Development: A Case Study on Kret Island, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Siriphen Dabphet</field><field name="description">Sustainable tourism development is widely accepted as an alternative approach to tourism development in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable in part to a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders&#8217; understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to destination stakeholders as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">sustainable tourism development, diffusion of innovation theory, communication channels, innovation characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208107</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Cop, a Thief, and a Priest ...and some bad grammar: An Unruly Un-Love Story and the First Nations Fiction Diction Essay That Goes With It</field><field name="creator">Jesse Macpherson</field><field name="description">This dissertation is comprised of two distinct but related components. The larger component is a short novel, titled A Cop, a Thief and a Priest. This is the story of three very different men, the woman they all want, her daughter who gets in the way, the secrets they all try to hide, and a few bedtime stories. Plus a Canadian Native or two. And maybe a bomb, as well. This work of fiction is written with a shifting perspective and varying degrees of adherence to the rules of grammar, depending on the narrator and characters in the scene. The story focuses on seriously flawed people in potentially harmful, though ceaselessly humorous, relationships and how they try to choose the best out of the poor options in front of them. In the course of the novel several Native Canadian/First Nations characters appear. Some are characters within the story, and others are cast members of several bedtime stories told by the three primary male characters. As I am not Canadian First Nations, I had concerns over writing dialogue and characterization of Canadian Native characters. In response to these misgivings, the accompanying critical essay component of this dissertation deals with the issue of a non-Native author writing Native characters. The thesis essay explores this question in the fiction of three Canadian authors who are not Canadian First Nations. I examine specifically their use of grammatical errors in the dialogue of their Native characters as a device to present diction as an element of the character&#8217;s status, education, gender, age, race or culture. The three authors chosen are W.P Kinsella, Anne Cameron, and Thomas King. These writers use diction variously, and each is scrutinized according to guidelines drawn from writing theory texts, commercial writing guides, and writing practice prescriptions from successful authors. The conclusions are considered in the crafting of my own First Nations characters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">orality, storyteller, grammatical error, voice appropriation, First Nations, Native, interfusional, dialogue, characterization, narrator</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209719</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of ultrasound technology for treatment of organic pollutants</field><field name="creator">Thangavadivel, Kandasamy</field><field name="description">The necessity of cost effective, environmentally friendly technology has become increasingly important to remediate persistent organic pollutants in the environment. The emerging greener ultrasound technology has the potential to serve the remediation industry. In this study, the use of low power, high frequency (HF) ultrasound (1.6 MHz, 145 W/L) has been shown to effectively remediate DDT (90% of 8 mg/L) in water and sand slurries. Addition of iron powder accelerated DDT degradation in the sand slurry under ultrasonication. The potential of HF ultrasound (1.6 MHz, 160 W/L) in degradation of the non-volatile, polar model compound methylene blue (MB) was studied in MB spiked demineralised water and wastewater. A 70 % of 0.4 mg/L of MB was degraded in demineralised water whereas only 54% of MB degraded in MB spiked wastewater. There was a decrease in MB degradation rate with an increase in MB concentration. High power, low frequency (LF) ultrasound (20 kHz, 932 W/L) was used to desorb 400 mg/L of DDT added to three different natural soil slurries at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt. % each. Each soil slurry was prepared in 0.1% v/v SDS surfactant solution, soaked for 30 min. and heated for another 30 min. at 40 oC before sonication. For the neutral pH soil slurry with higher dissolved organic carbon, the desorption efficiency achieved was over 80% in 30 s sonication. Alkaline soil with higher surface area than neutral soil indicated 60% desorption efficiency while the acidic soil, with the highest surface area and a higher amount of non-soluble organic matter, yielded 30% desorption efficiency under similar desorption conditions. Coconut fibre, used to biosorb the desorbed DDT in the decanted solution, was found to have over 25 g/kg of biosorption capacity for DDT. The surfactant SDS and associated DDT were completely separated from decanted liquid of the desorbed slurry with alum using adsorptive micellar flocculation in 60 min. settling. Acidic pH and molar concentration ratio of Al3+/SDS = 0.5 was used to completely remove the DDT. Using 20 kHz, 1125 W/L of sonication in an 80 mL reactor with air saturated 50 mg/L DDT at 20oC, the DDT removal efficiency achieved was 80% in 20 min. With zero valent iron addition, DDT removal efficiency in 15 min. is 100% with 15 and 22 mg/L of initial DDT concentrations. The settled DDT slurrywas remediated using 20 kHz at 240 W/L achieving DDT removal efficiency of 87% in 15 min. Also LF ultrasound was found to be effective in remediating chloroform (8 mg/L in 60 min) from spiked demineralised water and contaminated groundwater in both batch (120 W/L) and flow cell (6000 W/L) modes. Modeling and simulation of the ultrasonic reactor under 20 kHz ultrasonication was performed for various shape reactors using commercially available software. For almost all reactors, the highest ultrasonic intensity was observed near the transducer???s vibrating area. It was found that the highest acoustic pressure distribution, which is critical to the performance of the reactor, occurred in the conical reactor and flow cell configuration.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic water pollutants</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Pollution control equipment</field><field name="subject">250399 Organic Chemistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">291104 Environmental Technologies</field><field name="subject">ultrasound</field><field name="subject">persistent organic</field><field name="subject">DDT</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/93186</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45890</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gold price risk management : how much to hedge?</field><field name="creator">Blake, William John</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to study how the gold production industry has managed the process of hedging, or the forward selling of gold production.

It seeks to examine the factors that students believe affect their on-line interaction with each other and with the tutor. Hypotheses were developed to examine the relationship between language competence, paralanguage, discussion topic, cultural variables and on-line interaction. The study was carried out in three stages: focus groups; survey; and interviews. The purpose of the focus groups was to determine the factors other than those identified in the literature that might affect the on-line learning of the students. There were four focus groups involving 17 people and 10 hours of interview time. A great deal of interesting and relevant information was generated. The second stage involved a questionnaire that sought data about the factors identified in the focus groups and the literature review to test the hypotheses. There was an open-ended question asking students whether there were other factors that they believe might affect their on-line interaction. The sample was made up of 100 students and 57 valid responses were received. The third stage involved interviews with three students to follow up answers to the open-ended question in the survey. The participants in the interviews were invited to go through their answers to the open-ended question (i.e., factors that they think will affect on-line interactions) and to explain how they think the factors actually affected their on-line interactions. The results from the focus groups were analyzed using content analysis; the results from the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics including the chi-square test. Results show that the Chinese students in the present study accepted computer-mediated communication and had positive perceptions of on-line discussion. Similar to suggestions in the literature, it was found that social presence could be cultured among the on-line participants. For successful on-line learning, factors such as students' language competence, discussion topic, and tutor's involvement are important.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet in education</field><field name="subject">Open learning</field><field name="subject">Group work in education</field><field name="subject">Computer assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">social presence</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/98452</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46350</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive transmission for block-fading channels</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dang Khoa</field><field name="description">Multipath propagation and mobility in wireless communication systems give rise to variations in the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal, commonly referred to as fading. Many wireless applications are affected by slowly varying fading, where the channel is non-ergodic, leading to non-reliable transmission during bad channel realizations. These communication scenarios are well modeled by the block-fading channel, where the reliability is quantatively characterized by the outage probability. This thesis focuses on the analysis and design of adaptive transmission schemes to improve the outage performance of both single- and multiple-antenna transmission over the block-fading channel, especially for the cases where discrete input constellations are used. Firstly, a new lower bound on the outage probability of non-adaptive transmission is proposed, providing an efficient tool for evaluating the performance of non-adaptive transmission. The lower bound, together with its asymptotic analysis, is essential for efficiently designing the adaptive transmission schemes considered in the thesis. Secondly, new power allocation rules are derived to minimize the outage probability of fixed-rate transmission over block-fading channels. Asymptotic outage analysis for the resulting schemes is performed, revealing important system design criteria. Furthermore, the thesis proposes novel suboptimal power allocation rules, which enjoy low-complexity while suffering minimal losses as compared to the optimal solution. Thus, these schemes facilitate power adaptation in low-cost devices. Thirdly, the thesis considers incremental-redundancy automatic-repeat-request (INR-ARQ) strategies, which perform adaptive transmission based on receiver feedback. In particular, the thesis concentrates on multi-bit feedback, which has been shown to yield significant gains in performance compared to conventional single-bit ARQ schemes. The thesis proposes a new information-theoretic framework for multi-bit feedback INR-ARQ, whereby the receiver feeds back a quantized version of the accumulated mutual information. Within this framework, the thesis presents an asymptotic analysis which yields the large gains in outage performance offered by multi-bit feedback. Furthermore, the thesis proposes practical design rules, which further illustrates the benefits of multi-bit feedback in INR-ARQ systems. In short, the thesis studies the outage performance of transmission over block-fading channels. Outage analysis is performed for non-adaptive and adaptive transmission. Improvements for the existing adaptive schemes are also proposed, leading to either lower complexity requirements or better outage performance. Still, further research is needed to bring the benefits offered by adaptive transmission into practical systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital communications</field><field name="subject">power allocation</field><field name="subject">automatic repeat request</field><field name="subject">multi-bit feedback</field><field name="subject">block-fading channel</field><field name="subject">outage probability</field><field name="subject">230118 Optimisation</field><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">291703 Digital Systems</field><field name="subject">291799 Communications Technologies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">SNR exponent</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/96822</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46101</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paying for sustainable natural resources management : the role of levies</field><field name="creator">Wu, Zhifang</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is the modern rhetoric to guide environmental or natural resources management. There are many ways to do this and one concern the wider utilization of economic instruments, such as taxes or levies. Although such levies are becoming common in Australia and worldwide, the role of the taxes or levies is still limited. In many cases, these taxes/levies -although environmentally related- have a fiscal rather than a purely environmental motive, for example, the Natural Resources Management (NRM) Levy in South Australia. In South Australia, under the NRM Act 2004, all property owners are required to pay the NRM levy. Local governments collect the levy and distribute it to the relevant NRM board. The NRM boards have selected to calculate the levy on the basis of property value or simply applied a flat rate. The percentage of property value or the amount of the flat rate can vary amongst local government areas. How a tax or levy is designed should be determined by its ultimate purpose. Taxes or levies for fiscal and/or redistributive reasons should be designed in a way securing stable inflow of revenues, such as, levying on the values of property. However, this approach is often in sharp contrast with the goal of environmental taxes or levies which aim to change resource consumption behaviour. This study evaluates the NRM levy policy in South Australia using one NRM region and focussing on the urban community. The justification of this research is that few analyses of the effectiveness of environmental taxes or levies have ever been carried out, although the implementation of these measures has increased significantly during the last decades. There are fewer studies analysing the impacts of the tax or levy base method. This is the first study on this NRM levy policy from the perspective of the urban community who actually pay it. This study employed the Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980) to examine the relationships between community attitudes to the levy policy and water consumption behaviour. Data was collected through a web-based survey with 770 respondents who answered 59 questions. The key findings show that governments are perceived to have the main responsibility for water resources management by respondents. However, there is huge information void towards the NRM levy policy. Community has few complaints about the levy level but strongly prefers to have a levy calculated on the volume of water consumed. Respondents also indicated that they would use less water if the levy were calculated on the volume of water consumed. The study makes contributions to relevant theory and policy analysis. Theoretically, the results show that the theory of reasoned action has limited strength in explaining the present research context. Practically, the study provides recommendations for policymakers and practitioners in South Australia, other Australian States, and internationally. The clear implications of the results suggest that if a tax or levy aims to change water consumption behaviour then it should be based on the volume of water consumed not on property value.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural resources</field><field name="subject">Water supply</field><field name="subject">300903 Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">360201 Public Policy</field><field name="subject">370102 Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">water resource management</field><field name="subject">levy</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/93170</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45889</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overcoming practitioner resistance to health informatics systems in general practice medicine</field><field name="creator">Knight, John</field><field name="description">This thesis results from a multi-method study into why GPs in Australia resist the adoption of technology capable of collecting, amalgamating and potentially transferring patient health data outside their practice.

As a legacy of pervasive pessimism in the face of limited treatment, it is conceptualised and researched from biomedical and psychosocial perspectives that address impairment, problems of performance, quality of life, burden and disruption. Little stroke research is conducted once professional input has ceased, and yet considerable change occurs after this period with evidence that post-stroke wellbeing is independent of impairment and function -- many people do well in the face of poor prognoses, while others remain miserable despite 'good recovery'. Current advances in acute stroke management are generating increasing optimism, but lack of understanding about individuals' post-stroke experiences and long-term outcomes continues. While it is recognised that the impact of stroke on the lives of survivors and families is profound, rehabilitation focuses on recovery as task achievement and measured functional outcomes. For many survivors and their families 'recovery' is contested, ambiguous and extended. For some, it becomes a lifetime marathon because stroke represents an assault, not only to the body, but to the self and the lifeworld -- it is a 'life' event. This narrative inquiry into life after stroke explores recovery as a process taking place over time and conceptualised as a life transition. The work is grounded in narrative theory with the concept of transition providing the lens and focus for the research, its processes and analyses. Individuals' stories remain intact enabling evocation of diverse stroke meanings and the mapping of individual experience. Bringing these whole stories into conversation with each other elucidates post-stroke transition which is interpreted in light of theories of response to traumatic loss and informed by narrative theory. The thesis presents stories of trauma, loss and grief, situated in past lives and selves where assumptions about selves and future lives are shattered. The future makes no sense in terms of participants' past and present lives; life plots are lost and stroke therefore represents 'lost futures'. Stories of moving on to new lives are focused on being and doing in the present and have an expectant view of life. Although mindful of past lives and enduring losses, survivors actively engage in processes to reconfigure their lives with hope for a meaningful future. Transition is interpreted as 'reconfiguring the future'. The life tasks of reconfiguration are embedded in dynamic models of traumatic loss where grief is conceptualised as recursive movement between loss and meaning reconstruction evident in narratives that slowly move towards wellbeing. Despite broad recognition that loss and grief are part of the stroke experience, they are rarely addressed; where attention is paid it is likely embedded in explanatory models of staged response that oversimplify human experience. This thesis offers a new framework. It represents a fresh interpretation that highlights the ongoing traumatic impact of stroke. The post-stroke journeys of survivors and families are affected by individual circumstances and meanings. Although their stories are permeated with loss, many people move forward towards lives worth living. This interpretation suggests ways of reconfiguring lives in the face of devastation and ongoing traumatic loss. The work identifies a complex interaction of individual, emotional and social factors contributing to transitions to wellbeing following stroke and thus adds to a prospective vision of post-stroke life that can inform rehabilitation, discharge and stroke support strategies. Post-stroke transition will be enhanced when we use narrative framing and understanding to guide rehabilitative practice that uses meaning-centred models to prepare survivors and their families for a return to the lifeworld.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">321104 Clinical Nursing: Tertiary (Rehabilitative)</field><field name="subject">321209 Family Care</field><field name="subject">321212 Care for Disabled</field><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy: Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">321025 Rehabilitation and Therapy: Hearing and Speech</field><field name="subject">329999 Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">370201 Clinical Social Work Practice</field><field name="subject">370204 Counselling, Welfare and Community Services</field><field name="subject">380105 Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">440112 Hermeneutic Theory</field><field name="subject">stroke transition</field><field name="subject">narrative theory</field><field name="subject">traumatic loss</field><field name="subject">long-term stroke recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/92288</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45784</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Channel based medium access control for ad hoc wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Ashraf, Manzur</field><field name="description">Opportunistic communication techniques have shown to provide significant performance improvements in centralised random access wireless networks. The key mechanism of opportunistic communication is to send back-to-back data packets whenever the channel quality is deemed "good". Recently there have been attempts to introduce opportunistic communication techniques in distributed wireless networks such as wireless ad hoc networks. In line of this research, we propose a new paradigm of medium access control, called Channel MAC based on the channel randomness and opportunistic communication principles. Scheduling in Channel MAC depends on the instance at which the channel quality improves beyond a threshold, while neighbouring nodes are deemed to be silent. Once a node starts transmitting, it will keep transmitting until the channel becomes "bad". We derive an analytical throughput equation of the proposed MAC in a multiple access environment and validate it by simulations. It is observed that Channel MAC outperforms IEEE 802.11 for all probabilities of good channel condition and all numbers of nodes. For higher number of nodes, Channel MAC achieves higher throughput at lower probabilities of good channel condition increasing the operating range. Furthermore, the total throughput of the network grows with increasing number of nodes considering negligible propagation delay in the network. A scalable channel prediction scheme is required to implement the practical Channel MAC protocol in practice. We propose a mean-value based channel prediction scheme, which provides prediction with enough accuracy to be used in the Channel MAC protocol. NS2 simulation result shows that the Channel MAC protocol outperforms the IEEE 802.11 in throughput due to its channel diversity mechanism in spite of the prediction errors and packet collisions. Next, we extend the Channel MAC protocol to support multi-rate communications. At present, two prominent multi-rate mechanisms, Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) and Receiver Based Auto Rate (RBAR) are unable to adapt to short term changes in channel conditions during transmission as well as to use optimum power and throughput during packet transmissions. On the other hand, using channel predictions, each source-destinations pair in Channel MAC can fully utilise the non-fade durations. We combine the scheduling of Channel MAC and the rate adaptive transmission based on the channel state information to design the 'Rate Adaptive Channel MAC' protocol. However, to implement the Rate adaptive Channel MAC, we need to use a channel prediction scheme to identify transmission opportunities as well as auto rate adaptation mechanism to select rates and number of packets to transmit during those times. For channel prediction, we apply the scheme proposed for the practical implementation of Channel MAC. We propose a "safety margin" based technique to provide auto rate adaptation. Simulation results show that a significant performance improvement can be achieved by Rate adaptive Channel MAC as compared to existing rate adaptive protocols such as OAR.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ad hoc networks (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">ad hoc networks</field><field name="subject">230202 Stochastic Analysis and Modelling</field><field name="subject">280204 Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">291704 Computer Communications Networks</field><field name="subject">291703 Digital Systems</field><field name="subject">291799 Communications Technologies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">medium access control</field><field name="subject">rate control</field><field name="subject">wireless networks</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/92176</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45755</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming the tourist : Aboriginal tourism as investment in cultural transversality</field><field name="creator">Galliford, Mark</field><field name="description">The thesis is an examination of Aboriginal cultural tourism based on interviews with national and international tourists.
