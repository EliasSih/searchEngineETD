In the light of Marxist thought, the writer's work as a whole shows a conception of history as fundamentally irrational and non-progressive, governed by existential forces such as the passions of nationalism and class feeling, denounced by Julien Benda. Against History as Fate, Malraux appeals ultimately to the will to consciousness, whose chosen field of expression is art, Malraux's recourse amidst a dying Western culture. The final chapter of this thesis concerns the images that haunt Malraux's work, and sets up a model of the myth underlying the conscious thought of the writer. This 'personal myth' throws light on the writer's inner world, and on the direction his intellectual thought took. Consequently, the theological function of art in Malraux's aesthetical conception stems from his unconscious personality, which gives a profound meaning and unity to the contradictions apparent in the writer.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420108 French</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactions of Hydrocarbons on Raney Nickel in the Presence of Adsorbed Tritium</field><field name="creator">Long, Mervyn Allan</field><field name="description">The exchange of a number of hydrocarbons with tritium on a Raney nickel catalyst has been investigated for the purpose of developing a procedure for labelling such compounds with tritium.

Attempts to label hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents were less successful, the technique being suitable for aromatic compounds only. The reactions are discussed in terms of current theories of metal catalysis, the relevant aspects of which are reviewed in the introduction.

Within one week, seventy states, including all five nuclear-weapon states, signed the Treaty. This brought to an end fifty years of both nuclear tests and nuclear test-ban negotiations. For many states, the achievement of the CTBT was a major success for nuclear arms control. New Zealand played an important role in the early stages of the CTBT negotiation. Every year from 1972, New Zealand and Australia tabled a resolution in the General Assembly calling for a CTBT. After two decades of diplomacy, the resolution was adopted by consensus in 1993, allowing negotiation for a CTBT to take place in the Conference on Disarmament. Substantive negotiation for a CTBT began in 1993, but test-ban negotiations had been taking place almost since the start of nuclear testing in 1945. Like many other nuclear arms control issues, the negotiations had been dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union. Engaged in their own nuclear arms race, the two superpowers pursued their own bilateral nuclear arms control negotiations to manage their strategic relationship. Until the CTBT negotiation, multilateral nuclear arms control was mostly limited to the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT reflected the desire of many non-nuclear states to become involved in nuclear arms control and use multilateral agreements to place obligations on the nuclear-weapon states. While both bilateral and multilateral nuclear arms control often languished due to disagreements, multilateral nuclear arms control negotiation has also dealt with the complexity of reconciling the perspectives of many states. This complexity has made the use of negotiation theories difficult, although if used pragmatically, theory can be a useful tool for the study of negotiation events. Through the test-ban resolution, New Zealand was able to contribute to the process of reaching consensus by acting as a facilitator. New Zealand is a good example of how a small non-nuclear state can make a useful contribution in multilateral nuclear arms control negotiation, typically dominated by large nuclear-weapon states, and still advance its national interests.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and functional significance of ATP binding cassette transporters in human placenta</field><field name="creator">Evseenko, Denis</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to study ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the human placenta, in particular their regulation and role in trophoblast differentiation and survival. The presence and localisation of four major placental drug transporters, multidrug resistance gene product 1 and 3 (MDR1 and 3)/ABC subfamily B members 1 and 4 (ABCB1 and 4), multidrug resistance associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1 and 2)/ABCC1 and 2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 was initially studied in term human placenta, cultured primary trophoblast and BeWo and Jar trophoblast-like cell lines. Jar cells were found to be more similar to nondifferentiated cytotrophoblast with respect to their ABC protein expression profile, whereas BeWo cells more closely reflected differentiated syncytiotrophoblast. Treatment of primary term trophoblasts in vitro with cytokines (TNF-&#61537; or IL-1&#61538;) decreased expression and activity of apical transporters ABCB1/MDR1 and ABCG2/BCRP. Growth factors, on the other hand, increased BCRP expression and activity, while estradiol stimulated BCRP, MDR1 and MDR3 expression MDR1/3 functional activity. The ability of BCRP/ABCG2 to abrogate the apoptotic effects of TNF-&#61537; and ceramides was studied in primary trophoblast and BeWo cells using pharmacological and molecular (siRNA) approaches. The results suggest that BCRP/ABCG2 contributes to the resistance of trophoblast cells to cytokine-induced (extrinsic) apoptosis, whereas its effects on apoptosis activated via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is minimal. This altered resistance was associated with increased intracellular accumulation of ceramides and reduced ability to maintain phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. A role for BCRP/ABCG2 in cell protection from differentiation-induced stressors was also demonstrated during the process of cell fusion associated with transient loss of plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Finally, expression of BCRP/ABCG2 (and 9 other genes) was studied in 50 placentas from normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). A marked reduction of BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 expression was observed in FGR placentas, while other transporter genes were unaffected. Collectively these data suggest that BCRP/ABCG2 and probably other ABC transporters may play a hitherto unrecognised survival role in the placenta, conferring a &#8220;stress resistance&#8221; to trophoblast cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Placenta</field><field name="subject">ABC transporters</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel mucin-desulfating sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosaminidase (sulfoglycosidase) from the anaerobic colonic bacterium Prevotella strain RS2</field><field name="creator">Rho, Jung-hyun</field><field name="description">Sulfate removal from sulfomucin is believed to be a rate-limiting step in sulfomucin degradation by bacteria from the digestive tract. A novel sulfomucin-desulfating enzyme has been discovered in the anaerobic bacterium, Prevotella strain RS2, which can grow on colonic mucin as its sole energy source. The enzyme, located in the periplasm, was assayed by measuring p-nitrophenol removal from the model substrate sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine-1-p-nitrophenol, sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine being the other product. This activity differs from that of sulfatases which remove the sulfate ester group from sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine and its analogues substituted at the Cl position. The enzyme has been termed a sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosaminidase or sulfoglycosidase (SGL). The SGL was purified to a single protein band of 100 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified SGL protein was trypsin-digested and peptide fragments were sequenced. PCR and inverse PCR were then used to amplify the entire sg/ gene from Prevotella strain RS2 genomic DNA. After inserting the gene into a suitable plasmid, active recombinant SGL was expressed using an Escherichia coli expression system. The SGL was characterized using a selection of model substrates, and shown to be an exo-enzyme that removes non-reducing terminal sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine residues by glycosidic bond cleavage. When tested against its putative physiological substrate, sulfomucin, the only small molecular size product detected corresponded to a sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine residue. Thus the SGL can catalyze a reaction, formerly thought to be performed in bacteria by the combined actions of a N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase and a N-acetylglucosaminidase. Inhibition studies on the SGL were carried out. Inhibitors of the SGL and those of the sulfatases were used to confirm the presence or absence of SGL-like activity in other bacteria that inhabit environments containing sulfomucin. Four isolates, including Prevotella strain RS2, of the thirteen strains tested, appeared to have SGL-like activity. This research on the SGL with its novel catalytic activity, suggests a new mechanism by which sulfomucin desulfation can occur. The physiological importance of the enzyme is postulated to be (i) to provide energy in the form of sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine, for the bacterium, (ii) to remove sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine groups present on mucin chains, thus creating or removing sites for different adhesins, and (iii) removal of inhibitory sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine groups from mucin chains that limit degradation of the chain by exoglycosidases and neuraminidases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Almost Runge-Kutta methods for stiff and non-stiff problems</field><field name="creator">Rattenbury, Nicolette</field><field name="description">Ordinary differential equations arise frequently in the study of the physical world. Unfortunately many cannot be solved exactly. This is why the ability to solve these equations numerically is important. Traditionally mathematicians have used one of two classes of methods for numerically solving ordinary differential equations. These are linear multistep methods and Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. General linear methods were introduced as a unifying framework for these traditional methods. They have both the multi-stage nature of Runge&#8211;Kutta methods as well as the multi-value nature of linear multistep methods. This extremely broad class of methods, besides containing Runge&#8211;Kutta and linear multistep methods as special cases, also contains hybrid methods, cyclic composite linear multistep methods and pseudo Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. In this thesis we present a class of methods known as Almost Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. This is a special class of general linear methods which retains many of the properties of traditional Runge&#8211;Kutta methods, but with some advantages. Most of this thesis concentrates on explicit methods for non-stiff differential equations, paying particular attention to a special fourth order method which, when implemented in the correct way, behaves like order five. We will also introduce low order diagonally implicit methods for solving stiff differential equations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human resource management in Chinese-western joint ventures</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shaohui, 1966-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrological impacts of urban development in the Albany Basin, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Herald, John R. (John Raymond)</field><field name="description">In several areas of Auckland, urban development has resulted in flooding and siltation problems that have been both difficult and expensive to manage. This study investigates the fluvial processes of runoff and sediment generation with a pastoral catchment of the Albany Basin and assesses the potential hydrological impacts of urban development with its catchment area. During the study period this catchment was on the fringe of the urban development of Auckland's North Shore. By examining the factors that control runoff and sediment generation within a pastoral catchment, site information that may be useful for controlling runoff and sediment generation within an urbanised Albany Basin is gained. To assess the impacts of urban development, streamflows and suspended sediment yields from catchments representative of three different land uses are compared: pastoral, urban construction and developed urban. Stream channel enlargement indices for a number of nearby catchments with different proportions of urban land cover are also determined and compared. The study shows significant increases in stormflows and suspended sediment yields from catchments that are either fully developed or undergoing construction for urban use. But due to the relatively dry weather experienced during the study period these results are thought to underestimate the impact of urbanising the Albany Basin. The investigation of stream channel enlargement shows that for totally urban catchments stream channel cross-sectional areas may be nearly three times those for pastoral catchments. Methods for controlling the impact of urban development on streamflows, sediment yields and channel enlargement are discussed. It is proposed that by developing techniques where by storm runoff is dispersed and stored within the considerable soil moisture storage capacity of an urban land cover, of the type planned for the Albany Basin, that a considerable reduction in stormflow and sediment generation may be achieved. The study concludes that through careful land use planning and the use of appropriate control structure the impacts of urban development may be reduced to acceptable levels.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tryst Tropique: Pacific Texts, Modern Sexualities</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Leonelle</field><field name="description">Tryst Tropique questions some of the assumptions that have been made about the heterosexual trajectory described by European desire as it has informed literary, artistic and anthropological representation of the South Pacific. It reads a series of contact encounters and Pacific residencies for their unfolding of European sexual inscription and discovers their inevitable entanglement with problematics of homosexual definition. This thesis arcs between two readings wherein the sexual conduct of Polynesian men both requires and escapes European definition. The first, which settles on the documents of Cook's third voyage, uses British indifference to Hawaiian sodomitical desire to help measure a representational space from whence the European homosexual will emerge (Chapter Two). The next reading considers the erotics of male visibility legible across a number of Marquesan contact texts including Herman Melville's Typee (Chapter Three). Chapter Four discovers that the suspicion of sodomitical misconduct which clouded the career of William Yate, an early nineteenth-century New Zealand missionary, continues to involve twentieth-century commentators in the interpretative dynamics of sexual entrapment. Chapter Five turns to Gauguin's Tahitian writings and paintings to engage with the place of ambivalence in contemporary analyses of colonial discourse. Chapter Six extends the parameters of the thesis in terms of gender and of geography, taking up the controversy generated by Derek Freeman around the early Samoan fieldwork of Margaret Mead. It argues that in the example of Mead's career, we can observe the way in which female sexuality acts as the cipher by which culture multiplies and maintains ignorances and knowledges across the discursive field of sex in both cosmopolitan and primitive locations. The final chapter, which analyses a contemporary documentary representation of Samoan fa'afafine, finds the pertinence or applicability of European sexual description to Polynesian behaviour again at stake, though now we find that the liberal gesture of cultural relativism is co-optable to a homophobia already drilled and proficient in erecting a difference without to forestall a difference within. Reading against the grain of much postcolonial work on the South Pacific, Tryst Tropique finds that it is the male body-whether native or European-not the female, which provides the sexual vanishing point which structures many of these narratives. In each of these Pacific moments a privileged figuration occurs: the body which stands as a placemarker for erotic capacities-both indulged and forsworn-is indicatively male. These inscriptions of masculinity betray a certain amplifying anxiety; the discrepant sexual availabilities recorded in each text break with increasing urgency on the shore of heterosexual and homosexual definition. Even as these Pacific journal keepers, these writers and artists, map identity more and more ferociously onto the known grid of gender, it seems as if the horizon of sexual certainty further and further recedes.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420203 Literatures of the Pacific</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Madness, media &amp; mental illness: a social constructionist approach</field><field name="creator">Nairn, Raymond George Ross</field><field name="description">Background Depictions of mental illnesses in the mass media have been analysed and criticised for more than forty years with little improvement, and that has serious implications for the ongoing efforts to destigmatise both mental illnesses and those who suffer from them. Aims To examine media depictions of mental illnesses within a social constructionist framework. To identify why media depictions take the form they do and to indicate ways in which such practices may be more effectively addressed. Method Items chosen from factual media genres were subjected to discourse analysis. This form of analysis attends to the preferred meaning of the items and how that meaning is constructed within the item. Exemplars of such analysis are contrasted with the content analyses more commonly performed on media materials before reporting analyses of items from everyday media reports and of materials that were expected to be less stigmatising. Results Irrespective of the form of analysis it is found that media depictions of mental illnesses are dominated by representations of dangerousness, criminal violence, unpredictability, and social incompetence. The same features were found in a destigmatisation documentary and a series of backgrounders on mental health services, in both of which madness was utilised to create interest and drama. It is argued that these characteristics occur because media personnel, like most laypersons, represent mental illnesses as forms of madness. Conclusions That my social constructionist analysis is able to account for the lack of change in media depictions over forty years. That the preference for a public mental health approach to destigmatisation is misplaced because it is unable to address the fear generated by lay understandings of mental illnesses. That the attempt to avoid conflation of the person with the disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals beginning in 1980 was an inadequate step in an appropriate direction in that it sought to remind clinicians that a mental disorder does not make a person non-human. The thesis findings are interpreted as showing that destigmatisation requires a new way of depicting mental illnesses, one that privileges the individual's experience and their ordinary humanness.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Edition of the Book of Sovereign Medicines MS X3346</field><field name="creator">Lalor, Daphne E. (Daphne Elaine)</field><field name="description">This thesis is an edition of a manuscript of medical remedies, MS X3346 (now stored in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington) which belongs to the Medical Historical Society of the Auckland branch of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. The manuscript is one of five known copies of a compilation by a sixteenth century Benedictine monk, John of Feckenham, who became Abbot of Westminster during the reign of Mary Tudor. In the dedication to the manuscripts, which is almost identical in each, the Abbot states that 'This Book of Sovereign Medicines' Named for convenience throughout this edition, 'The Book of Sovereign Medicines' was collected by him for 'the poor who have not at all times the learned physicians at hand'. The scribal handwriting, and the names of various people in MS X3346, indicate that it was penned between 1665 and 1675, or about seventy-five years after Feckenham's death. Research into the life of the compiler was undertaken, as was an overview of the medical ideas of the period, together with a study of the popular genre of which the Abbot's work was an example. Also included in this thesis is a Provenance of the manuscript, a description of its state, a comparison of it with the other known copies, and the story of its donation to the Medical Historical Society. A transcript of the manuscript was prepared, maintaining the scribal spelling, punctuation and capitalization as accurately as possible. Following this, a modernized version was made, aiming at a readable text. The layout of the original manuscript and the transcript was maintained as far as possible, to facilitate keying of annotations and comments to the text. The Oxford English Dictionary was used as the standard for spelling and grammar, and an attempt was made to conform to the principles used by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor in the compact edition of Shakespeare's Complete Works. A glossary was prepared defining herbs, ingredients, medical terms and so on. Annotations to the remedies indicate the same or similar examples in other works, especially in the Folger edition of 'This Booke of Sovereigne Medicines' (edited by E.R.Macgill in 1990). Also in the annotations are explanations of words and phrases specific to a remedy, and identification of many of the people mentioned in the work. Quotations from authors of the time of Chaucer to the modern day are included in the glossary and annotations to help define and illustrate medical terms and ingredients perhaps not familiar today. Early herbals were studied, especially those of William Turner and John Gerard. As Eleanour Sinclair Rohde (The Old English Herbals, p.98) has pointed out, Gerard was justly condemned by critics of his own time as well as modern ones for 'having used Dr Priest's translation of Dodoen's &#9090;Pemptades&#9089; without acknowledgement'. Nevertheless, this editor, like Rohde, has found such pleasure in Gerard&#8217;s delightful language, his descriptions of plants, with their habitats and their virtues, that many quotations from his Herball have been included. There is an index of authors and quotations, and also a general index to the contents of the modern version.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gendered Resistance: A Comparative Study of Four Twentieth-Century Women&#8217;s Autobiographies</field><field name="creator">Baisn&#233;e, Val&#233;rie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Currie Commission and Report on Education in New Zealand 1960-1962</field><field name="creator">Scott, David John, 1946-</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates and analyses the Report of the Commission on Education in New Zealand,1962, also known as the 'Currie Report', paying particular attention to the policy process surrounding the written and oral submissions. Views expressed during the submissions and their ideological basis are related to wider power relationships within society. The submissions emanating from outside the Department of Education are revisited as well as the departmental submissions to establish whether there are any grounds to challenge the consensual, liberal interpretations that have been attached to this important New Zealand historical educational document. The issues raised and avoided in the submissions coalesce around specific themes, which are related to the broader issues of the development of New Zealand educational history. Attempts to counteract, mute and marginalise dissent and to encourage optimal social control are witnessed in the organizational structure of the commission and in its methods. The interaction and networking of key participants is studied and the important inter-relationship between central bureaucratic interventions and powerful educational pressure group activity points to the continuing operational success of central government processes. The often competing forces of provincialism and centralism in New Zealand education underlie many of the conflicts surrounding educational change. Religion, race, gender and class are forces that continually interact to create legitimation crises. The governmental attempt to minimise or at least rationalize these socially contested differences in education from 1960-1962 is the subject of this thesis. An analysis is made of the process by which public dissatisfaction regarding education in the fifties and sixties was mediated and largely marginalised by the educational bureaucracy. This is done by a thorough examination of the interaction of pressure groups, unions, media and governmental agencies during the two year submissions to the Commission on Education 1962. The distinction between the commission's report and the submissions and interrogations leading up to the report is important, as the primary data extracted from the primary resource material in the submissions, at times, contradicts the departmental view as expressed in the report itself. In this way it is hoped to move beyond the rhetoric that informs previous commentaries and move closer to an interpretation based upon the primary data.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"For a season quite the rage?" : ships and flourmills in the Ma&#772;ori economy 1840-1860s</field><field name="creator">Petrie, Hazel, 1949-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Critique of the Influence of Sustainable Development on Ecological Sustainability: A New Zealand Application</field><field name="creator">Knight-Lenihan, Stephen</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a method to critique whether introducing sustainable development concepts into a planning process enables decision-makers to effectively address ecological sustainability. The method is trialed by assessing the adoption of sustainable development concepts by the central Government of New Zealand. A Sustainable Development Assessment Framework is proposed, allowing users to judge what kind of sustainable development is being applied and, consequently, how ecological issues are likely to be assessed against economic and social needs. An Ecological Assessment Matrix is also proposed. This identifies the key ecological issues that need to be addressed, and suggests the management responses required to address them. The key issues identified are: ecosystem disturbance, modification and fragmentation; the accumulation and synergistic effects of contaminants; the accumulation of physical change on ecosystems; and biodiversity decline. In combination, the Framework and Matrix assist in making judgments as to whether and how the ecological sustainability component of sustainable development is being addressed. A critique is then undertaken of the New Zealand Government&#8217;s Economic Transformation environmental sustainability actions/action areas and, in more detail, the influence of introducing sustainable development requirements into the transport sector. The critique includes reviewing aspects of resource management and local government legislation. The focus is on the adoption of sustainable development concepts from the year 2000. Conceptually, ecosystem sustainability is increased by halting or reversing the negative trends associated with the key ecological issues. This contributes to creating robust social-ecological systems. Whether and how sustainable development is addressed is influenced by existing ecosystem resilience (a system&#8217;s ability to cope with perturbations, including development), the ability of human society to influence resilience (society&#8217;s adaptability), and the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when economic, ecological or social conditions require it (transformability). The critique process contributes to assessing ecosystem resilience and a society&#8217;s level of adaptability. It concludes that incorporating sustainable development concepts has enabled decision-makers to address the key terrestrial and freshwater ecological issues in ways that were not available prior to the concepts being adopted. However, analysis also indicates the guiding rationale for decision-makers remains economic, despite intentions to the contrary. This suggests that existing net negative ecological trends may continue. Indigenous biodiversity is a particular case in point. Relevant guidelines and goals are required to address this situation. Also, while ecological issues could be addressed through the Resource Management Act 1991, other research demonstrates the intent of the Act has not been realized. Contributory reasons include a failure to adequately resource key central government agencies and local government. These barriers need to be addressed to ensure the potential benefits of the sustainable development process are realized across all applicable legislation. The observations above are provisional. The Framework and Matrix proposed now need to be applied at the local government level, in co-ordination with research being done by others, to test whether some of these indicative barriers are being addressed locally. In connection with this, an Epilogue is included in this thesis. It outlines how community-led sustainable development could complement initiatives at the central Government level. It uses the need to integrate biodiversity management into &#8216;working&#8217; environments as an example of how this could operate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of ethyl cellulose based grafting copolymers</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Betty Qilan</field><field name="description">Copolymerisation of ethyl cellulose (EC) with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and vinyl acetate was carried out in solution, using a number of free radical initiators, to form graft copolymers with grafting yields up to 63% and weight average molecular weight about 9 x 104 g mol-1 Graft copolymerisation of MMA and EC appears to involve participation of comonomer charge transfer complexes at the initial stage of reaction, Interaction of EC with the carbonyl group of MMA enhances the electron-accepting ability of EC and promotes the formation of a donor-acceptor complex as matrix, with the resultant generation of a covalent bonded monomer radical, which then propagates in the usual manner to produce EC-g-PMMA. The influence of a number of experimental variables on the grafting efficiency of the EC-g-PMMA reaction, and the properties of the resulting copolymers, was investigated. The initiator has a significant effect on the grafting efficiency, which decreases in the order azobisisobutyronitril&gt;ammonium persulphate&gt;potassium persulphate&gt;Ce(IV) ion. Benzoyl peroxide was found to be unsuitable because it promoted degradation of ethyl cellulose chains. The order of solvent influence on the grafting yield is chloroform&gt;toluene&gt;benzene. The grafting yield is also reaction time and temperature dependent. A2-3 hour reaction time and 40-50&#176;C reaction temperature gives a substantial increase in both reaction rate and the molecular weight of the graft copolymer product. The introduction of PMMA graft side chains onto EC main chains leads to a significant decrease in the radius of gyration in solution, as determined by size exclusion chromatography, compared to linear EC. This finding is explained by the theory of Stockmayer and Fixman in terms of the number and type of long chain graft points in the molecule, Calculation of viscosity of EC-g-PMMA in solution using the Kurata equation gave values in good agreement with the experimentally determined viscosity. A significant result is that grafting PMMA branches onto EC reduces the hydrodynamic volume, and differential scanning calorimetry showed conclusively that increasing PMMA sidechain length reduces the chain flexibility, by reduction of free volume. The glass transition temperature of EC-g-PMMA, produced by using a large excess of MMA monomer and reasonably long reaction time, was shifted to higher temperature with increase of grafting yield and molecular weight. A single glass transition is observed for copolymers made using low initiator concentrations, and two glass transitions are found for higher initiator concentrations. In addition, EC-g-PMMA samples with higher grafting yield are more brittle than those with lower grafting yield. However, both the bending modulus (determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) and elongation at break increase with grafting yield. Our experiments proved that the crystallinity of EC-g-PMMA is less than that of pure EC and greater than that of pure amorphous PMMA. The specific oxygen gas-permeability coefficients of EC-g-PMMA films decrease with increase of grafting yield. The reason is that grafting decreases of hydrodynamic volume. Interestingly, X-ray diffraction showed that the higher the grafting yields of EC-g-PMMA, the higher its crystallinity. Films of EC-blend-PMMA, made by solution casting and examined in cross section using scanning electron microscopy, showed an essentially multiple layer morphology with non-uniform dispersion of PMMA in the EC matrix. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed, as expected, that EC-g-PMMA cast films were homogeneous with no evidence of phase separation. The tensile strength of EC-g-PMMA films was typically about 20% higher than that of EC-blend-PMMA films, and the graft copolymer films exhibited greater oxygen permeability. A new model for graft copolymerisation to EC is proposed. The model provides for the possibility that grafting to EC with 48% ethoxy content can occur at the five OC2H5 groups and one OH group per unit. It was established using NMR spectrometry of EC-g-PMMA and EC-g-Poly (vinyl acetate) that under some conditions the ethoxy groups are the favoured graft sites. The liquid crystalline properties of EC and EC-g-PMMA were extensively investigated. Optical microscopy with crossed polarisers revealed that the relatively short mesomorphic temperature range of ethyl cellulose is extended downwards almost to ambient temperature in the graft copolymer. Low frequency Raman scattering showed that EC-g-PMMA has higher light scattering intensity than EC at ambient temperature. But it was lower than that of EC at 191&#176;C. Moreover, the Jaynes-Cummings model cannot predict the light scattering intensity of EC-g-PMMA as a function of frequency very well, whereas the EIT-Kerr scheme is able to successfully account for the experimental observations. It was found that EC and EC-g-PMMA are pseudoplastic, lyotropic and thermotropic materials whose viscosity in solution is dependent on many factors, particularly on temperature and solution concentration. Both materials show unusual rheological behaviour, including maxima in the isothermal concentration dependence of viscosity. Unmodified EC exhibits thixotropic flow behaviour, whereas grafting PMMA side chains onto EC changes the flow behaviour to rheopectic, which is also typical of PMMA itself. As the temperature and concentration increase, the viscosity increases in response to the transition from an isotropic to an anisotropic state of EC-g-PMMA. Furthermore, experiments on the distinguishing characteristics of EC-g-PMMA indicate that different solvents affect its anisotropic flow behaviour to a greater or lesser extent. In particular, chloroform shows a stronger flow orientation effect than tetrachloroethane on EC-g-PMMA solutions. The rheological behaviour of EC and EC-g-PMMA in the nematic phase is much more complex than that of ordinary polymers or low molecular weight liquid crystals. The Doi theory is usually applicable to ordinary polymers or low molecular weight liquid crystals, but cannot predict shear stress as a function of shear rate; particularly at very low shear rates for EC and EC-g-PMMA. Whereas, the polydomain model is better to account for the observations. Measurements of thermally stimulated depolarisation current showed that EC-g-PMMA has a longer dipolar relaxation time in an electrical field. Molecular dipole motions of EC give a maximum depolarisation current at 138 &#176;C in the glass transition region and another maximum near 200 &#176;C, corresponding to dipolar relaxation in the liquid crystalline phase. EC-g-PMMA shows a broader dipolar relaxation temperature range in the liquid crystalline phase and the depolarisation current maximum shifts to a lower temperature. We have observed that field induced polarisation of EC-g-PMMA is affected by the length of the PMMA side chain, and obeys an interfacial model of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars type. It was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the length of the PMMA side chain could affect the surface properties. EC-g-PMMA has higher photoemission intensity than EC, and the photoemission intensity and depolarisation current increase with grafting yield.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alienated by Evolution: The Educational Implications of Creationist and Social Darwinist Reactions in New Zealand to the Darwinian Theory of Evolution</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Bill</field><field name="description">This investigation explores the reactions to Darwinism in the format and informal education of New Zealand society. The subsidiary purpose is to look at some implications for formal education. Many of the reactions have focussed on distortions of the Darwinian theory of evolution with the form of reaction to Darwinism being centred on different views of humankind. The various group interests have caused different aspects of Darwinism to be highlighted particularly when groups feel their interests are under threat. Using aspects of an "HS3" historical survey technique i.e. the history of the public reaction to an aspect of science and science teaching, key features of this debate are set in context. This context is then used to show that creationist objections and social Darwinian interpretations share many characteristics with their overseas counterparts. A philosophical analysis of the positions taken supports a charge that New Zealand creationist science is partly non science, and partly bad science. It is also shown that confusion has been created when groups have debated issues from different perspectives including cultural perspectives. In particular there has been a lack of communication as various creationist groups, using different research bases, and political, economic and legal institutions, have adopted generalist conservative positions, highlighted metaphysical and ethical considerations and drawn on creationist science literature to support the science of their case while pro-evolutionist groups have adopted specialist liberal or progressive positions, concentrated on the logic and epistemology of the debate and have drawn on mainstream science literature. Finally some implications have been drawn from this analysis of the different reactions, and recommendations have been made for future teaching of evolution and related concepts.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Utilising Dehydroabietic Acid</field><field name="creator">Franich, Robert Arthur</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the utilisation of the natural product, abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid* (dehydroabietic acid) (1) for the synthesis of optically active steroids and diterpenoids. The work has been divided into three sections which describe transformations of rings A, B and C of abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid (1). Selective epoxidation of the alkene mixture (3-5) derived from oxidative decarboxylation of abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid (1) with lead tetraacetate has given the epoxides (64), (65), a low yield of the epoxide (66), and the pure exocyclic alkene (3). The alkene (3) was oxidised to the ketone (6) which has been previously employed as an intermediate for the synthesis of the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone (10). The epoxides (64) and (65) have been converted to the unsaturated ketones (89), (107), and (67), and the saturated ketones (13), (99) and (100). A study of the boron triflouride rearrangements of the three epoxides (64), (65) and (66) has been made using benzene and dimethyl suplhoxide as solvents, and pathways for the formation of the products are suggested. Peracid oxidation of the enol acetate (155) derived from the C 7-ketone (18) provided a facile introduction of oxygen substituents into the hindered C 6 position of abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid (1). By hydrogenolysis of the C 7-hydroxy substituent of the compound (162), the C 6-acetate (172) was obtained. Hydrolysis of the latter compound, and methylation of the acid formed gave the C 6-alcohol (175) which was oxidised to the C 6-ketone (176). The literature pertaining to the intramolecular functionalisation of aromatic alkyl groups has been surveyed, and, with the ultimate aim of synthesizing the aromatic steroids (237) and (249), the C 13-isopropyl group of abieta-8,11-13-trien-18-oic acid (1) has been functionalised by the application of two of the published procedure, viz. the lead tetraacetate oxidation of aromatic acids, and the thermolysis of diaxomethyl ketones. Nitration of methyl 12-acetylabieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oate (227) has given products of nitrodeacylation (44) and nitrodealkylation (266). The product of nitrodealkylation (266) has been converted to methyl 13-hydroxy-podocarpa-8,11,13-trien-18-oate (59) in 36% yield. Methylation of the phenol (59), and Birch reduction of the methyl ether (276) has given podocarp-8(14)-en-18-ol-13-one (281). Annelation of the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone (281) with bromoacetone was attempted in order to synthesize the steroid (284), but the only product identified was the furan (286). * The numbering system used throughout this thesis is that proposed by J.W.

The syntactic analysis is presented within a framework which is an adaptation of Chomsky's 'Standard Theory' but special consideration is given to the problem of squaring a grammar based on formal evidence with a functionally-based analysis of sentences. The principal modification to the Standard Theory is the readoption of kernel sentences and generalized transformations, i.e. a partial reversion to the transformational model proposed in Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. Thus, the output of the base rules is a set of simple sentence structures, with no embeddings. The treatment of other aspects of Tokelauan included in this analysis are described below in a brief synopsis of each chapter. Chapter 1 is introductory, serving to locate the language, place and the people of Tokelau. Previous discussions of the position of Tokelauan within the Polynesian group are reviewed, and a basic vocabulary list is provided together with Cognate percentages shared by Tokelauan of Samoan, Nanumean Ellice and Sikaiana. The aims and scope of this analysis are then discussed in the context of a brief survey of earlier syntactic studies of Polynesian languages, and of the various grammatical models applied to Polynesian or developed in recent theoretical work on syntax and semantics. Chapters 2 and 3 are essentially referential, presenting lists of all the grammatical elements and rules to be discussed in later chapters. Chapter 2 has two parts. In Part 1 the segmental phonemes of Tokelauan are described, along with the practical problems associated with the choice of orthographic symbols. In Part 2 the functor (grammatical) morphemes of Tokelauan are listed and their uses exemplified. Chapter 3 lists the categorial rules of the base component and some transformational rules. Chapters 4-6 discuss evidence for and against the formal analysis outlined in 3. Chapter 4 treats the major categorial (phrase structure) rules, stating the procedures used to determine immediate constituents, and defending potentially controversial parts of the analysis against alternatives. Formal and functional analyses are made independently, then compared. In Chapter 5, certain transformational rules of Tokelauan are examined with illustrative examples. The final chapter is in two distinct but related parts. First the grounds on which Hohepa based his ergative-accusative classification of Polynesian languages are summarised, and reviewed in relation to the evidence of Tokelauan. One result is a rejection of the concepts of direct object (and so, of transitivity) and of an active-passive transformation a s significant grammatical relations in Tokelauan. The later sections examine certain functional relations associated with the constituent analysis of sentences particularly the functions of case markers. This exercise provides a framework for verb classification in Tokelauan.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Current Anodization of Magnesium and Magnesium Alloys</field><field name="creator">Carter, Ellen Angharad</field><field name="description">High current anodization of magnesium and magnesium alloys Ellen Angharad Carter Pure magnesium and three magnesium alloys containing different amounts of aluminium (2-9%) plus zinc and manganese were anodized with constant current density in sodium hydroxide solution with and without fluoride or phosphate ions. Electric field strengths of resultant anodic films were calculated from galvanostatic transients. These transients showed three characteristic features: linear voltage increase, noisy high voltage signals accompanied by sparking, and sawtooth-like events characterized by instantaneous voltage drops followed by slower voltage increases. Each feature was linked to certain physical processes occurring in the metal/film/solution system. Oxidation of magnesium and magnesium alloys formed anodic films with bilayer structures: a passive barrier layer adhering to the metal electrode, topped by a porous secondary layer. Cation injection into the barrier film across the metal/oxide interface was the rate determining step for film growth. Interstitial cations migrated through the film under the influence of the electric field. At the film/solution interface they reacted with electrolyte species and either thickened the film or dissolved in solution. Electric field strength was constant for particular metal/solution combinations and was independent of applied current density. Changing the electrode material altered the resultant electric field strength: pure magnesium produced oxides with lower electric field strengths than films formed on the three magnesium alloys. Changing the electrolyte had no discernable effect on the electric field strength. Charge efficiency of the film growth process was investigated by oxygen gas evolution; efficiency decreased during sparking. Ion beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering, fluorine depth profiling and nuclear reaction analysis) coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction studies and Raman spectroscopy gave information about the anodic film surface. These techniques showed that oxides formed on magnesium-aluminium alloys were thinner than those formed on pure magnesium caused by aluminium dissolution. Fluorine depth profiling revealed that concentration profiles for fluorine in anodic oxides formed in fluoride-containing solution altered depending on the aluminium content of the electrode material.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing home to her mother and father: Fabrizia Ramondino&#8217;s Althe&#769;nopis and Clara Sereni&#8217;s Casalinghitudine</field><field name="creator">Green, Paula, 1955-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420110 Italian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Productivity improvement in the New Zealand heavy engineering industry</field><field name="creator">Seidel, R.

They are united by an emphasis on the relation between linguistic forms and communicative functions, and in particular on the semantics and pragmatics of grammatical categories. Chapter 1, 'Outline of the main structures of Tokelauan' forms a background for the more intensive studies of later chapters. After short sections on phonology, morphology and word classes, I describe the composition of noun phrases and verb phrases, the pronoun system, and the internal structure and semantics of nominalisations. The final two sections cover a number of aspects of the structure of the simple sentence, including predicate types, verb classes, and clause types, and review the main types of complex sentence. Chapter 2, &#8217;Tense and aspect', presents a discourse-based analysis of this area of syntax. Section 1 outlines the theoretical basis of the analysis of Tokelauan tense-aspect categories which is presented in the following two sections. I then extend the analysis to a particular discourse type, oral Tokelauan narrative. The final section takes a typological approach, considering whether the particle kua can be regarded as a member of a cross-linguistic category of Perfect. Chapter 3, &#8216;The discourse functions of focus constructions&#8217;, looks at a number of Tokelauan constructions involving clause-initial noun phrases which clearly have the pragmatic force of focusing, but in some of which the distribution of given and new information is not of the expected kind. Since clause-initial noun phrases are used for other discourse functions which can be grouped under the heading of topicalisation, the chapter concludes with some comments on this matter in section 2. Chapter 4, &#8216;The syntax of complementation&#8217;, attempts in the first three sections a comprehensive description of Tokelauan complement types and of the semantic classes of complement-taking predicates. Section 4 is concerned with the syntax and semantics of complementizers, and sections 5 with reduced complements of the kind which have been associated with the terms equi-deletion and raising. The final section assesses the overall nature of the Tokelauan complementation system.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Clemmensen Reduction of 1,4-Diketones</field><field name="creator">Crump, Douglas Ronald</field><field name="description">The mechanisms proposed for the Clemmensen reduction of simple ketones are critically examined, and the Clemmensen reduction of difunctional ketones is reviewed. The Clemmensen reduction of a number of 1,4-diketones has shown that the products formed depend on the conformation of the carbonyl groups: (a)	syn or anti-periplanar alignment of the carbonyl groups within the C2-C3 bond favours fragmentation e.g. cyclohexane-1,4-dione leads to hexane-2,5-dione and hex-5-oF-2-one, (b)	with 1,2-diacetyl systems formation 3f alcohols and furans predominates e.g. hexane-2,5-dione gives hexan-2-ol, and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, (c)	when both carbonyl groups are in a large ring (&#8805;C7) formation of cyclobutanediols is possible e.g. 2,6,6-trimethylcycloheptane-1,4-dione is reduced to 3,3,6-trimethylbucyclo[3,2,0]-1&#946;-diol, (d)	when none of these conditions is satisfied normal reduction occurs e.g. cholestane-3,6-dione yields cholestan-6-one. A mechanism is proposed for the formation of hexan-2-ol, hex-4-on-2ol, and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran from the Clemmensen reduction of hexane-2, 5-dione. The production of a number of similarly constructed 1,4-diketones and Y-functionalised ketones is also examined. The synthetic visibility of the fragmentation reaction, previously observed to occur under Clemmensen conditions, is investigated and it is shown that this is of limited value for the preparation of large rings. The stereochemical requirements for the reaction are verified and the mechanism is further studied. A review of the synthesis of 1,4-diketones is given and the preparation of the compounds used in this study is discussed in detail. The Clemmensen reduction of two 1,5-diketones is examined. The formation of cyclopropanediols and cyclopropanols from the Clemmensen reduction of some monocyclic formyl-ketones and &#946;-hydroxy-ketones is discussed. The Clemmensen reduction of hexane-2,5-dione and pentane-2,4-dione with different metals is investigated.</field><field name="date">1970</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes of sedimentation on the shoreface and continental shelf and the development of facies Pakiri, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Michael John</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the results of research of physical and biological processes of sedimentation on the shoreface and continental shelf in Pakiri Bay, on the east coast of the Northland Peninsu1a, New Zealand. These environments comprise the subtidal portion of the Pakiri sand body. Sand bodies that are contiguous with unconsolidated sediments of coastal barriers are characteristic of the embayed east coasts of the Auckland and Northland Regions, yet little is known of their geomorphology. Existing models of shoreface and shelf sedimentation afford limited assistance because they were developed in different environments. Factors that distinguish the study area from other coasts include tectonic stability, lack of modern (non-biogenic) sediment inputs, the predominance of currents related to shoaling surface waves, and a sea level stillstand for the last 6,500 years. The model of sedimentation developed is derived from intensive field investigation of the morphology, sedimentology and ecology of the Pakiri Bay shoreface and continental shelf. Investigations of sediment transport entail interpretations of the sediments and sedimentary structures of the seabed, application of existing sediment transport models and the analysis of morphodynamic data. The geomorphology of the Pakiri sediment body is characterized by a regular pattern of morphologic components and associated sediment types. Alongshore variation in these characteristics is generally minor compared with shore normal variation. The shoreface comprises a curvilinear concave surface, that extends offshore from the alongshore bar approximately 1500 m, to water depths of about 22 n. The inner continental shelf comprises an equally curvilinear, mostly convex, surface that slopes seaward to the relatively flat middle continental shelf. Secondary morphological variations result from the presence of large-scale bedforms on the middle continental shelf and landward margin of the inner shelf. The sediments of the shoreface are fine, very well sorted quartz-feldspathic sands of 2 &#248; mean grain size. The inner shelf sediments grade offshore from a medium sand to very coarse sands and fine gravels (mean grain size 0.0 to 0.5 &#248;). In contrast the sediments of the mid shelf are very fine sands (mean grain size 2.0 to 2.5 &#248;), with a mud content of 5 to l0 percent. Carbonate skeletal debris, derived mostly from molluscs, comprises a significant proportion of inner and mid shelf sediments. The concentration of carbonates in the sediments increases offshore from 0 to 5 percent on the shoreface to 30 percent at the base of the inner shelf. The carbonate fraction of the sediments is size graded on the inner shelf and mid shelf in accordance with the grain size characteristics of the non-carbonate fraction. A model of the distribution and abundance of living macrobenthos (mostly of the phyla mollusca) is derived from benthos surveys in Pakiri Bay. Species that are diagnostic of high and low energy environments are characteristic of the shoreface and middle continental shelf respectively. The pattern of carbonate concentration in the sediments of the subtidal sediment body does not correlate with the pattern of modern biogenic production. Highest levels of modern shell production occur across the shoreface, whereas carbonate concentrations are greatest at the base of the inner shelf. Hypotheses are advanced to explain this dichotomy. The geomorphology of the shoreface and inner continental shelf is seen as a response to modern processes of sedimentation. Sediment transport occurs primarily in response to currents related to shoaling waves. Two process regimes are recognized. During typically calm (swe11 wave) conditions the fine sands of the shoreface may be transported landward as a result of an onshore mass transport current. During severe storm events this process may transport bed sediments landward across the inner shelf and middle continental shelf forming the characteristic sediment and morphologic patterns observed. However, during such events this onshore flow is, probably counteracted by return flows that are able to transport eroded foreshore and inshore sediments seaward Key words: Sedimentation, shoreface, continental shelf, wave dominated, carbonated sedimentation, sediment body, facies.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Studies of Prostratin and of Oxalate Bridging</field><field name="creator">McCormick, Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis is presented in three parts.

Almost three quarter of the world&#8217;s milk, beef and veal are produced from temperate grasslands. In New Zealand, ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is the main pasture constituent with more than half of the total export revenue coming from grass-related products. Much of ryegrass production and quality depends on the timing of flowering through seasonal progression. In many plants, day length is the critical environmental parameter that controls when plants begin to flower. In Arabidopsis the CONSTANS (CO) gene mediates day length response. Upstream of CO is the GIGANTEA (GI) gene which is associated with the circadian clock mechanism and is required to promote CO expression. The FT gene is the immediate downstream genetic target of CO and is a direct promoter of flowering. In this study, cDNA libraries, sequence alignment and genome walking were used to sequence and describe three putative orthologues from the ryegrass photoperiod pathway: LpGI, LpCOL1, and LpFT3. All three behaved in a true photoperiod manner characterised by cycling expression patterns under continuous light conditions and differential expression patterns in LD and SD conditions. Different photoperiods brought about differences in expression of these genes measured either by the phase shift change (LpGI and LpCOL1) or by the change of the transcript level (LpFT3). Gene expression changes over a vernalisaton time course were also analysed and results indicated that LpFT3 acts as the flowering integrator. The role of LpGI, LpCOL1, and LpFT3 as putative photoperiod genes was further confirmed by genetic mapping, which placed them on linkage groups 3, 6, and 7, respectively. The syntenic positions in rice contain major heading date quantitative trait loci. The function of LpFT3 was examined by over-expressing the gene in Arabidopsis under control of the cauliflower mosiac virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Substantially higher expression of the endogenous Arabidopsis AtFT transcript was observed in the mutated ft-1 line overexpressing LpFT3, suggesting a positive feedback loop either directly or through upstream intermediaries. Overexpression of the LpGI and LpFT3 genes restored rapid flowering to the respective gi-3 and ft-1 Arabidopsis mutants while overexpression of LpCOL1 did not accelerate flowering either in co-2 or wild type Arabidopsis plants. However, overexpression of LpCOL1 completely restored the late flowering phenotype of the gi-3 mutant indicating the existence of another important link outside the well established hierarchy of GI-CO-FT in the photoperiod pathway. This study revealed that the ryegrass photoperiod pathway genes show high similarity to their wheat, rice and Arabidopsis counterparts. Exploring ways to modulate flowering time in ryegrass could provide major benefits to the agricultural industry by increasing forage quality, controlling seed and pollen production, and addressing potential problems linked with climate change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flowering</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">photoperiod</field><field name="subject">molecular</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic investigation of dipyridinium dications and their associated radical monocations</field><field name="creator">Brienne, St&#233;phane Henri Rudolf.</field><field name="description">A range of compounds related to the diquaternised salts of 2,2'-dtpyridine and 4,4'-dipyridine was studied in the present investigation. The effect of the change in the redox-state of the compounds was determined by vibrational spectroscopic and molecular orbital techniques. The investigation of 2,7-dimethylthieno[2,3-c:5,4-c'] dipyridinium diiodide monohydrate was undertaken by X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopic and molecular-orbital techniques. These investigations showed that the thiophenic portion of the dication exhibited partial aromaticity. On formation of the radical monocation, a pattern of bond length changes consistent with the formation of a quinoidal structure was predicted by molecular-orbital calculations. This suggests that the electron delocalisation occurs over the entire molecule. The resonance Raman spectrum of the cation monoradical exhibits bands which may be assigned to the thiophenic portion, which suggests that this portion is associated with the chromophore. IR spectroscopic investigations into the electrogenerated radical of N,N'-diheptyl 4,4' - pyridinium, which has been investigated as the coloured component of electrochromic displays, were performed. The reflectance IR spectra of the radical monocations were obtained through bulk-sampling potential subtraction (PS) and surface-selective polarisation modulation (PM) techniques. The comparison between PS and PM spectra of the radical generated as a solid film in an aqueous medium, with the PS spectrum of the radical generated in acetonitrile revealed differences. These were interpreted in terms of an equilibrium between monomeric and aggregated forms of the radical. Similar results were obtained for the related compounds, methyl viologen and its dicyano substituted salt. The simplicity in the pattern of bands in the PS IR spectra of the monomeric radicals of methyl- and dicyanomethyl viologens was investigated by calculating the IR spectra of the dications and cation radicals of these compounds by molecular orbital techniques. The intense spectral features could be interpreted in terms of a charge-oscillation of the radical electron across the pyridine rings. The dipole moment of such modes is large and leads to the enhancement of these modes. The effect of various counterions associated with heptyl viologen was investigated by Raman and IR techniques. The pattern of bands in the Raman spectrum exhibited little variation with differing the counterions. The PS IR spectra exhibited disappearance features associated with the counterion in contrast to the PM spectra where no such bands were observed. PS IR spectra were also obtained by synchronising data acquisition with potential sweeps. The intensity of disappearance features in the PS IR spectra attributable to the CH modes varied at a similar rats to bands assigned to the radical aggregate. This suggested that a reorientation of the dipyridine ring and the quaternising alkyl chain probably occurs on reduction to form the radical. The lack of reversibility associated with the degradation of viologen films was investigated by PS IR techniques. The effect is probably associated with changes in the composition of the solid rather than a change in the concentrations of the monomeric and aggregated forms of the viologen radical. Dialkyl bridged diquaternary compounds of 2,2'-dipyridine were investigated by IR and theoretical techniques. The observation that the calculated dihedral angles for the dications and cation radicals were similar allowed the trends in the electronic absorption maxima (ultra-violet) and electrode potentials to be interpreted. Selective enhancements of bands in the PS IR spectra of the radicals suggest that a charge-oscillation mechanism may also be operative in these compounds. The utility of a combination of structural, theoretical and vibrational spectroscopic studies is demonstrated in these studies.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing bodies: a Maori healing tradition in a bicultural state</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Tony, 1972-</field><field name="description">Biculturalism is a relationship in government between the British Crown and the indigenous [M&#257;ori] people of New Zealand. I show that this relationship permeated some M&#257;ori healing practitioners&#8217; healing knowledge and perception. A key way in which this occurred was through the practitioners recognizing biological and social boundaries between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; [New Zealanders of European descent]. A second was through the practitioners&#8217; embodiment of connections with social groups including the nation, a history and present shared between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; and an idealized pre-contact past. A fundamental principle of Te Oo Mai Reia was that for the practitioners to harness the power of the various forces that sustained life they had to be in touch with their whakapapa [genealogy] for it was through their ancestors that they could commune with the Ultimate Deity, Io, the source of the most potent of all forces of life. A further key principle was that spiritually inspired and traditional M&#257;ori culture heightened the wellbeing of M&#257;ori, not modern, P&#257;keh&#257; culture. Spiritual and ancient knowledge was supra-conscious and made knowable through an embodied awareness of self and other. To make my argument I draw on literature inspired by Foucault that shows how states govern by implementing their operations and securing their penetration into the citizenry by drawing and building upon pre-existing bodies of knowledge and relations of power. I also draw on literature that shows how the human body bears the effects of such practices of government. To this literature I integrate perception by showing how, in this M&#257;ori healing context, the government of the bicultural nation-state worked through the ways the practitioners made sense with the body (especially through feeling, seeing and touching).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">embodiment</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Cell Membrane Ultrastructure, and the use of the Freeze-Fracturing Technique in Electron Microscopy</field><field name="creator">Chalcroft, James Paul</field><field name="description">1) The Ultrastructural appearance of frozen-fractured mouse liver cell membranes, and consistent variations in the distribution of membrane-associated particles caused by various pretreatments as described by previous investigators, were confirmed in this study. 2) Freeze fracturing, was evaluated as a method for studying the ultrastructure of single celled microorganisms. Large prokaryotes with previously undescribed morphologies were investigated using freeze fracturing, thin sectioning, and negative staining techniques. 3) Structures thought to represent flagellar attachment sites were demonstrated in frozen fractured bacterial preparations for the first time. 4) A previously undescribed level of cell organization was discovered in a rumen organism classified morphologically as Selenomonas. 5) A technique was devised to retrieve replicas from both sides of the fracture of a single frozen-fractured specimen. The results obtained by its use support the theory that frozen cell membranes fracture along some interior plane rather than at the membrane-cytoplasm boundary. The technique also showed that the particles seen on frozen fractured membranes lie within the thickness of the membrane. 6) For determination of the third dimension in freeze fracture replicas, i.e. the heights of various features, an alternative method to stereoscopy was devised.

The results of extensive research in this area have clarified many intervention issues and this has led to the development and implementation of treatment programmes aimed specifically at adolescents. Notwithstanding the publication of a small number of outcome studies, process evaluations of treatment programmes for this client group have not featured in the literature. This dissertation presents the findings of a process evaluation of the three main community based adolescent sexual offender treatment programmes in New Zealand. The evaluation aimed to investigate how the programmes worked so that their strengths and weaknesses could be identified. The findings provided the basis for recommendations aimed at improving service delivery and programme effectiveness. Qualitative methods were employed with data being obtained from in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, direct observation and written documentation across three sites. Results indicate (a) high levels of consumer satisfaction with the programmes; (b) the importance of providing flexible and integrated approaches to treatment; (c) engagement in treatment was facilitated by the quality of the client-therapist relationship, family involvement, culturally appropriate communication, and creative and physical activities; (d) the importance of providing clients with good pre-entry information to reduce barriers to participation; (e) recognition should be given to issues of cultural difference by ensuring cultural services for ethnic minorities are integrated into all levels of programme delivery; (f) the importance of building strong interagency collaborations and public relations; and (g) the importance of strong organisational structure and leadership support for staff. The results are discussed in terms of programme improvement in the New Zealand context as well as their application to programme development and improvement in other settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The soil seed bank in Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl. (kauri) forests of northern New Zealand and its potential role in secondary successions</field><field name="creator">Sem, Graham</field><field name="description">The soil seed bank in Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl. (kauri) forests of northern New Zealand is quantified, and its potential role in secondary successions examined. Seed bank data from a number of kauri forest sites stratified by successional time and distance from forest edges are summarized using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (ordination) and linear regression models. A number of issues concerning secondary successions and the soil seed bank are discussed. These include: 1. The relationship between the soil seed bank and extant vegetation. 2. The nature of the soil seed bank and successional time. 3. The nature of the soil seed bank and distance from forest edges. 4. The soil seed bank, canopy gaps and gap regeneration strategies. 5. The nature of the soil seed bank and soil properties. 6. The fruiting phenology, seed rain, and soil seed bank dynamics. The forest sites ranged from 50 years to over 1,000 years old, while distance from forest edges ranged from 0.2 km to 3.5 km. Soil seed bank densities under kauri forests were 134 - 5,388 seeds m-2 with a mean density of 1,320&#177;217 seeds m-2 which is similar to estimates reported for temperate and tropical forest sites elsewhere. The spatial distribution of seeds in the seed bank both within and between sites is highly variable. A total of 6,062 seedlings emerged from the seed bank samples. This represented 62 vascular plant species, 26 (42%) native woody, 19 (30%) native weedy, 16 (26) adventive weedy and 1 (2%) native fern. The species composition of the soil seed bank was not closely related to extant vegetation and only 11%ot canopy and 13% of understorey species were represented in the soil seed bank. Thus, 77% of extant vegetation at any given site is floristically different from that of the soil seed bank. Ordination of the data by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) suggested that extant vegetation (canopy and understorey) and the soil seed bank contain characteristic floras. The species composition of the seed bank is variable between sites. The viable seed pool is larger under young successional forests than under older mature forests. The number of species also declined with distance from forest edges. Adventive and native weedy species were found in seed banks under mature forests and sites of considerable distances from forest edges. However, the density of the weedy species component of the soil seed bank was at least partly determined by distance from forest edges where such species are common. While buried seed is likely to contribute to the early stages of secondary succession, evidence from canopy gaps suggested that the seedling bank (formerly suppressed understorey component) is more important in gap regeneration than the soil seed bank. DCA analysis revealed that seedling bank species composition of canopy gaps and forest sites were quite different from the soil seed banks, indicating that regeneration stemmed from formerly (suppressed) understorey seedlings. Phenology and seed rain study of a mature forest remnant and a regenerating forest community showed that as little as 5% of the seed input to the forest floor enters the soil seed bank and remains viable for more than one year. Evidence is presented to suggest that in a forest community, secondary succession after large-scale or localised disturbance, is achieved more so by suppressed seedlings and recent seed rain than the soil seed bank. The soil seed bank becomes significant in secondary succession when the subsoil is disturbed by the uprooting of trees or the forest floor is exposed by tree-fall (not covered by tree-fall debris).</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Contribution to the Chemistry of Solasonine and Some Solanum Species</field><field name="creator">Hoare, John Leonard</field><field name="description">Introduction: General. The family Solanaceae, to which the Solanurn genus belongs, is  comprised of some 70 genera and approximately 2000 species. Its  members, which are herbs, erect or climbing shrubs and, occasionally,  small trees, are distributed in the tropical and extend to the temperate  regions, the greatest concentration being in Central and Southern  America. The family's chief point of interest chemically is the  fact that many of its members contain alkaloids, well known examples  being Atropa belladonna (containing atropine), Datura strammonium(daturine), Nicotiana tobacum (nicotine), and Solmum tuberosum (solanine).  The Solanum (Latin - solamen, solace or quieting) genus is made up  of some 1,200 species, three of which, S. tuberosum (potato),  S. lycopersicum = Lycopersicum esculentum Mill. ( tomato), and S . nigrum  (a common weed of cultivation), are especially well known. New Zealand  has one endemic species, namely S. aviculare Forst. Agriculturally,  mainly because of S. tuberosum and S. lycopersicum, the genus is of course  an important one but in addition several species are used in horticulture,  e.g. S. pseudocapsicum and S. macrmthum, and a few species, e.g.  S. mammosum and S. dulcamara, are reported as being of medicinal  value. Chemically it is unique, in that may species contain glycosidic  steroidal alkaloids and most attention has been devoted to the characterisation  of these substances, although various other constituents, e.g.  commarins and anthocyanins, have been reported.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnostic writing assessment: the development and validation of a rating scale</field><field name="creator">Knoch, Ute</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migrating genders: westernisation, migration, and Samoan fa'afafine</field><field name="creator">Schmidt, Johanna Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of how fa&#8217;afafine identities are constructed, maintained, and changed in the contexts of contemporary Samoa and New Zealand. Fa&#8217;afafine are biological Samoan males who, to varying degrees, enact feminised gender identities. In existent representations, fa&#8217;afafine tend to be interpreted through western conceptualisations of sex/gender/sexuality, or using models of &#8216;primitivism&#8217;, which locate them as instantiations of expressions of gender or sexuality that are more &#8216;natural&#8217; than those of the &#8216;civilised&#8217; west. &#8216;Traditionally&#8217;, all gender in Samoa is primarily marked through labour, although the influx of western material and discursive culture has led to a shift in emphasis on sexuality in expressions of Samoan gender. These shifts have inevitably affected how fa&#8217;afafine identities are enacted, experienced, and understood. These influences are even more marked for fa&#8217;afafine who migrate to New Zealand, who appear to go through a number of &#8216;stages&#8217; in first assimilating into western sex/gender discourses, and then asserting their unique identities as fa&#8217;afafine. However, the paths followed by individual migrants vary according to the dominant ideologies of the time. The processes by which migrant fa&#8217;afafine locate physical and social spaces in which they can enact feminine identities are outlined, which usually initially involve identifying as either &#8216;gay man&#8217; or &#8216;woman&#8217;. In order to identify explicitly as &#8216;fa&#8217;afafine&#8217; in a New Zealand context, participants must understand themselves as somewhat ambiguously gendered. Data collection has been primarily through in-depth interviews, supplemented by observation, to enable analysis of how fa&#8217;afafine themselves understand their identities and lived experiences. The particular problems outlining these processes in the light of the exigencies of cross-cultural research are discussed in the methodology chapter. The theoretical approaches underlying the thesis as a whole incorporate the perspectives of Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, and Judith Butler in understanding gender as performative and open to slippage in response to the availability of particular discourses, yet also sedimented over time in a manner which configures the body in ways which are not easily altered.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Design and Verification of a Cryptographic Security Architecture</field><field name="creator">Gutmann, Peter</field><field name="description">A cryptographic security architecture constitutes the collection of hardware and software which protects and controls the use of encryption keys and similar cryptovariables. This thesis presents a design for a portable, flexible high-security architecture based on a traditional computer security model. Behind the API it consists of a kernel implementing a reference monitor which controls access to security-relevant objects and attributes based on a configurable security policy. Layered over the kernel are various objects which abstract core functionality such as encryption and digital signature capabilities, certificate management and secure sessions and data enveloping (email encryption). The kernel itself uses a novel design which bases its security policy on a collection of filter rules enforcing a cryptographic module-specific security policy. Since the enforcement mechanism (&amp;e kernel) is completely independent of the policy database (the filter rules), it is possible to change the behaviour of the architecture by updating the policy database without having to make any changes to the kernel itself. This clear separation of policy and mechanism contrasts with current cryptographic security architecture approaches which, if they enforce controls at all, hardcode them into the implementation, making it difficult to either change the controls to meet application-specific requirements or to assess and verify them. To provide assurance of the correctness of the implementation, this thesis presents a design and implementation process which has been selected to allow the implementation to be verified in a manner which can reassure an outsider that it does indeed function as required. In addition to producing verification evidence which is understandable to the average user, the verification process for an implementation needs to be fully automated and capable of being taken down to the level of running code, an approach which is currently impossible with traditional methods. The approach presented here makes it possible to perform verification at this level, something which had previously been classed as "beyond Al" (that is, not achievable using any known technology). The versatility of the architecture presented here has been proven through its use in implementations ranging from l6-bit microcontrollers through to supercomputers, as well as a number of unusual areas such as security modules in ATMs and cryptographic coprocessors for general-purpose computers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enzyme activities associated with gonadotropic hormones</field><field name="creator">Daja, Mirella Maria</field><field name="description">A structural relationship between gonadotropic hormones and certain types of enzymes has been suggested in previous studies and an investigation into the possibility of enzymatic activity associated with the gonadotropic hormones has been the primary focus of the research presented in this thesis. Partial sequence homology between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and &#945;-chymotrypsin prompted the recent proposal of a tertiary structure of hCG using &#945;-chymotrypsin as a folding template, which suggested the possibility of intrinsic peptidase activity associated with hCG. Highly purified hCG (CR127) was assayed for enzymatic activity against a range of synthetic peptide substrates and was found to exhibit Arg-specific peptidase activity. This activity was almost completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and to a lesser extent by N-&#945;-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), which indicated that the observed protease activity was serine protease-like. To establish whether this activity was intrinsic to the hormone or due to contaminants, extensive purification procedures were carried out. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and soybean trypsin inhibitor-affinity chromatography were found to effectively separate the protease activity from the hormone, indicating the presence of exogenous protease contaminants in the highly purified preparation of hCG. Further analysis by [3H]-DFP labelling of hCG and SDS-PAGE of the isolated contaminants revealed the presence of possible serine proteases with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 20 kD. Because serine proteases are known to stimulate cAMP production in the same target cells, it was necessary to determine the effects of the contaminating proteases on the receptor binding of hCG and cAMP production. The presence of these contaminants was found to have no apparent effect on the receptor binding capability of hCG, however the in vitro biological activity of hCG as determined by maximal cAMP production was decreased after HIC-HPLC purification of the hormone. These observations suggested that the serine protease-like contaminants contributed to the total cAMP production, thereby introducing significant error in biological assays that use hCG (CR127). The possible intrinsic enzymatic activity of hCG against its receptor as a natural substrate was further investigated. A membrane-bound receptor preparation was isolated from porcine ovaries and a receptor binding assay successfully established. The effects of hCG binding upon the membrane-bound receptor were studied and receptor proteolysis was observed. However, this proteolysis could not be definitively attributed to the actions of hCG. A purified receptor was subsequently prepared by hCG-affinity chromatography and analysed by SDS-PAGE with detection by autoradiography and silver staining. The purified receptor was found to have undergone proteolysis during the purification procedure, presumably following incubation with the hCG affinity matrix. Recent reports of the presence of homologous amino acid sequences in the active site of thioredoxin and the &#946;-subunit of the gonadotropic hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and subsequent demonstration of thioredoxin-like activity associated with these hormones, prompted an investigation into the possibility of thioredoxin-like activity associated with hCG. LH, FSH and hCG were all assayed for their ability to promote reactivation of reduced and denatured RNase. Although LH was shown to be capable of reactivating reduced RNase, the level of activity detected was significantly lower than that previously reported, whereas FSH and hCG were not found to be capable of this thioredoxin-like activity. These results suggested that the previously reported thioredoxin-like activity may be due to contamination of the hormone preparation, by the ubiquitous enzyme thioredoxin. The possibility of LH possessing intrinsic dithiol-disulphide interchange activity was investigated further using [3H]-iodoacetic acid. RNase/LH were incubated in an attempt to quench a dithiol intermediate. Preliminary results suggested that the presence of LH in this reaction increased the amount of protein radiolabelled, however, the isolation of a radiolabelled dithiol intermediate which could be conclusively identified as LH was not forthcoming. Furthermore the lack of RNase reactivation activity in hCG, suggests that the putative thioredoxin-like activity of LH, if intrinsic, may not be involved in receptor activation and/or signal transduction, as hCG and LH share the same receptor and should therefore have a similar mechanism of activation.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation and understanding: mental models as an interface in the process of translation</field><field name="creator">Kikuchi, Atsuko</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses two characteristics of language which affect translation, using English and Japanese examples. However, the general points made in the thesis are not specific to these two languages. One characteristic of language is that it encodes particular perceptions of experience by its users. Word meaning is defined in this thesis in terms of the typical experience the language user associates with a word. Concepts for which there are no single lexical items are encoded by putting together words which the speaker thinks best characterise the concept. This particular characterisation of a concept may become established in the language community. If the members of a language community form a habit of characterising a concept in a particular way, it may become difficult to perceive the concept in any other way. In translation, this may lead the translator to impose characterizations established in her own language on the other language. However, such difficulties can be overcome because of the creative capacity of people everywhere to learn new ways to perceive the world. And language provides the mechanism to encode such novel perception. This is the other characteristic of language discussed in this thesis. We can use an existing word to encode a new kind of experience which we perceive as having some connection with the kind of experience associated with the word. Such novel application of a word can be understood because upon hearing the word, the typical experience associated with the word is evoked in the hearer's mind, and using her knowledge, the hearer constructs a mental model which she thinks best accounts for the combination of experiences evoked in her mind by the linguistic forms. Defining word meaning and sentence meaning in terms of mental images allows us to understand the process of translation: Upon hearing/reading the source language text, the translator constructs a mental model based on the text. She then bases her translation on this mental model, which becomes a rich source of information. Because the translator is not moving directly from one language to the other, no direct correspondences between the linguistic forms of the two languages need to be sought. This also explains why it is relatively easy to translate between two languages whose users share similar experiences and therefore can build similar mental models, even if the languages are typologically very different from each other.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420115 Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Janssen, Bart-Jan</field><field name="description">A system has been developed to aid in the establishment of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for new plant species. A series of binary vectors have been constructed that express a chimaeric &#946;-D-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in plants cells but not in bacterial cells. This feature allows GUS activity from transformed plant cells to be assayed in the presence of Agrobacterium. Preliminary experiments examined the expression of these chimaeric GUS genes in transformed petunia leaf discs. GUS expression was detectable 2 days after inoculation, peaked at 3 &#8211; 4 days and then declined; if selection was imposed expression increased again after 10 - 14 days. The amount of expression observed 4 days after inoculation correlated well with stable integration as measured by kanamycin resistance, hormone independence, and gall formation. Histochemical staining of inoculated leaf discs confirmed the transient peak of GUS expression 3 - 4 days after inoculation. Surprisingly, GUS expression was concentrated in localized zones on the circumference of the disc; within these zones essentially all the cells appeared to be expressing GUS. These results suggest that the frequency of gene transfer from Agrobacterium is extremely high within localized regions of the petunia leaf explants, but that the frequency of stable integration is several orders of magnitude lower. A reliable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system has been established for kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayward) by using transient expression of GUS to monitor gene transfer frequencies. In vitro culture of kiwifruit plants and conditions for regeneration of plants from leaf discs have been established. Several factors were found to improve gene transfer frequencies in kiwifruit: (i) healthy actively growing source tissue; (ii) the use of Agrobacterium strain A281; (iii) the presence of a layer of moistened filter paper between the leaf explants and the cocultivation media; and (iv) the presence of 20 &#956;M acetosyringone in both the bacterial culture media and in the cocultivation media. Pre-culture of leaf explants significantly inhibited gene transfer, particularly at the cut edge of the explants. Using the optimized transformation system, at least one transgenic plant can be regenerated from each leaf inoculated. Stable transformation frequencies have been shown to vary significantly between different binary vectors. Phenotypic, PCR, and Southern analysis has confirmed the presence of stably integrated T-DNA in several transgenic kiwifruit plants.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Namakir: a description of a central Vanuatu language</field><field name="creator">Sperlich, Wolfgang B., 1948-</field><field name="description">This is a description of the phonology, morphology and syntax of Namakir, a language of the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian, which is spoken on some six small islands of the Shepherd Islands, central Vanuatu. My perspective on Namakir is that of a person trained in linguistics, who carried out linguistic fieldwork for the purpose of grammatical description. In addition I contributed to ethnographic work as well as compiling data for a dictionary, part of which is appended to the present description. Namakir is a conservative language which retains many features that make Oceanic languages unique. Thus it is a valuable witness for comparative and reconstructive work in Oceanic linguistics. The physical, social and historical setting of Namakir is detailed in the introductory chapter. A section on theoretical issues concerning the descriptive enterprise is included. The chapter on phonology outlines the Namakir consonant and vowel inventories, with due emphasis on the glottal stop which, as a reflex of the Proto-Oceanic glottal stop, is a unique occurence in Vanuatu languages Sections on phonotactics, stress and phonological processes add to the basic description of segments. In the chapter on morphophonemics the dynamics of derivational processes are explored. A major section deals with consonant alternation, a phenomenon widely discussed in Oceanic Linguistics. The major form classes are detailed in the next chapter. Nominals, determiners, adjectives, verbs and adverbs are established as word categories and paradigm tables are provided for comprehensive overviews. The last chapter on Namakir syntax provides a systematic description of noun phrase and verb phrase. Possessive constructions receive special attention as they exhibit a number of unusual features. The verb phrase is discussed within the framework of the Oceanic definition of verb and periphery which include subject markers as well as pronominal objects. The Namakir mood and aspectual system is presented in detail. A major section deals with serial verb constructions in relation to current descriptive theories. The concluding sections discuss selected items regarding complex sentence structures. Negation and question sentences, existential and comparative sentence types are included. Coordination together with direct and indirect speech is noted to use forms of a quotative verb, being especially significant in the organisation of narrative sequences. Relative and temporal clauses share a single overt marker. A morpheme-to-morpheme glossed narrative is appended to demonstrate narrative style. A substantial Namakir-English-Bislama wordlist is added as a repository of data collected during fieldwork.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's Writing in New Zealand Newspapers, 1930s and 1980s</field><field name="creator">Holt, Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of writing by New Zealand children in the Children's Pages of five New Zealand newspapers: the New Zealand Herald, Christchurch Press and Otago Daily Times in the 1930s and 1980s, the Dominion in the 1930s; and the Wellington Evening Post in the 1980s.

It considers the ways in which children (especially girls) consciously and unconsciously used public writing to create a public place for themselves. It compares major themes chosen by children, their topic and genre preferences in writing, and the gender and age differences evident in these preferences. The thesis is organised into three Parts, with an Introduction discussing the scholarly background to the issues it explores, and its methodology. Part One contains two chapters examining the format and tone of each Children's Page. And the role and influence of their Editors. Part Two (also of two chapters) investigates the origins and motivations of the young contributors, with a special focus on the Otago Daily Times as a community newspaper. Part Three. of four chapters, explores the children's writing itself, in separate chapters on younger and older children, and a chapter on the most popular genre, poetry. The conclusion suggests further areas of research, and points to the implications of the findings of the thesis for social history in New Zealand and for classroom practice. The thesis contains a Bibliography and an Appendix with a selection of writings by Janet Frame and her family to the Otago Daily Times Children's Page in the 1930s.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queueing and Storage Control Models</field><field name="creator">Sheu, Ru-Shuo</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tamarillo mosaic potyvirus: characterization and resistance</field><field name="creator">MacDiarmid, Robin M.</field><field name="description">The export of tamarillo is an important component of the New Zealand, exotic fruit industry. However, the quality of tamarillo fruit is severely decreased by tamarillo mosaic potyvirus (TaMV) which detrimentally affects fruit colour resulting in the fruit being unacceptable on the international marketplace. Virus incidence was surveyed in four tamarillo growing regions. Viruses were detected by indicator plant symptomology, and the incidence confirmed by dot blot analysis or ELISA. TaMV was present in 100% of tamarillo trees analyzed in ten of the twelve orchards surveyed. Incidence of potato aucuba mosaic potexvirus, cucumber mosaic cucumovirus, alfalfa mosaic virus and arabis mosaic nepovirus, which had all been previously reported in tamarillo was also determined. Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus was identified for the first time in tamarillo plants in New Zealand. TaMV RNA was purified from infected tamarillo leaves and a 1600 base pair cDNA clone generated to the 3'-terminus. The clone was sequenced and the location of the gene for the coat protein was identified by direct amino-terminal sequencing of purified TaMV coat protein. Comparison with other potyvirus coat protein sequences established that TaMV represents a new member of the potyvirus group. Seven chimeric transgenes containing TaMV sequences were constructed in three different binary vectors suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants. Of the twenty-six independent Nicotiana benthamiana plant lines generated expressing either TaMV coat protein or TaMV RNA sequences modified to block translation, eight plant lines demonstrated resistance to virus infection (more than 10% of resistant plants/line). All plants of one line, PT#25, were resistant to TaMV infection using dilute inocula; 40% were also resistant after inoculation with more concentrated inocula. The level of accumulation of CP in transgenic plant lines did not correspond with the degree of resistance to TaMV infection. In eight of the twenty-six transgenic lines a proportion of plants demonstrated recovery from systemic infection. Recovery was manifested as an absence or significant reduction of virus symptoms in newly developed leaves of plants that had previously shown symptoms of systemic TaMV infection. The mechanism of recovery from systemic infection is discussed. The protocol for the regeneration of transgenic tamarillo by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was improved. The efficiency of transformation was optimized and the rate of transgenic shoot elongation was increased. Two tamarillo plants transformed with a transgene designed to express the TaMV coat protein were produced and were demonstrated to express the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and TaMV coat protein gene. However, following challenge with a low concentration of inoculum, micropropagants of these tamarillo plants failed to demonstrate resistance to TaMV infection. Three in vitro enzymatic activities of the virus encoded cytoplasmic inclusion protein were studied. The cytoplasmic inclusion protein was purified to near homogeneity using differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient purification. RNA-stimulated ATPase activity was demonstrated and the Km and Vmax determined. RNA binding and energy-dependent dissociation were characterized. RNA helicase activity of the cytoplasmic inclusion protein was demonstrated in the presence of NTP using RNA duplexes with single-stranded overhangs. These results have confirmed and extended the previous findings of the likely RNA helicase function of the potyvirus cytoplasmic inclusion protein, and suggest possible future mechanisms for obtaining resistance to potyviruses.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host races and cryptic species in marine symbionts</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Peter M. (Peter Michael)</field><field name="description">The Pinnotheridae is a family of decapod crustaceans comprising more than 120 mostly microphagous and commensal species. As symbionts of a variety of aquatic invertebrates, pinnotherids typically live in an intimate association with their host depending on it for an almost lifelong source of nourishment and shelter, together with a site for mating. The New Zealand pinnotherid fauna was thought to comprise only one species, Pinnotheres novaezelandiae Filhol, associated with a multitude of hosts. Recently, however, a separate species, P. atrinicola Page, has been described which is regarded as being host specific to the horse mussel Atrina zelandica Gray. In this context, the relationship between pea crabs and their hosts is of special interest, and is the focus of this thesis. An investigation into the population dynamics of the symbiotic relationship between P novaezelandiae and its host, the green-lip mussel Perna canaliculus, at Westmere Reef, Auckland between May 1986 and July 1988 is reported. Ovigerous females and Stage I males and females were found throughout the sampling period, indicating that reproduction is continuous in this species. The developmental composition of the pea crab population reveals that soft-shelled males, usually regarded as an anomalous instar, formed a significant component of the pea crab population at all times. It is suggested that these individuals represent a distinct facies, analogous to the Stage II female instar. The presence of a pea crab was found to have a highly significant detrimental effect on mussel condition. Analysis of the distribution of pea crabs among the mussel population indicates mature crabs display a repulsed distribution favouring to live a solitary existence, whereas younger (pre-hard and Stage I) crabs showed a random distribution in broad agreement with a theoretical Poisson distribution. The biological status of the two described taxa was investigated by a survey of electrophoretically detectable genetic variation of populations from throughout the North Island of New Zealand. Pea crabs from 18 host populations from nine geographically disparate localities were subjected to cellulose acetate and poly-acrylamide electrophoresis. Forty-one enzyme systems were screened for polymorphism. Clearly resolved enzyme phenotypes were obtained at 23 presumptive loci, of which l5 exhibited polymorphism. An analysis of electromorph frequency data revealed that both taxa are highly genetically structured and typified by high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity; results atypical of brachyuran crabs. P- atrinicola was found to exhibit strong patterns of geographic differentiation and clinal variation in electromorph frequency. Of particular significance is the pattern of genetic differentiation observed among populations of p. novaezelandiae. Hierarchical F-statistics indicated that the preponderance of inter-population differentiation can be attributed to differences in electromorph frequency among host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae within a sampling locality. Geographic differentiation was a comparatively insignificant factor in the structuring of the sampled P. novaezelandiae populations. Individuals belonging to two genetically very distinct units were found within a newly recorded host species, Mactra ovata ovata Gray at Green and Wood Bays, Manukau Harbour. Hardy-Weinberg analyses indicate the host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae exhibit such a pronounced pattern of homozygote excess and disturbance from genetic equilibrium in sympatry that it is unreasonable to consider them as a single panmictic population. It is concluded that significant biological discontinuities based on host origin exist within the currently recognised taxon. Such a conclusion is supported by data presented on qualitative differences in host recognition observed between different host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae. Conservatively these discontinuities indicate host race development, although a viable alternate hypothesis would be the presence of cryptic, host-specific biological species within P. novaezelandiae. Hostrace development as found here is a well recognised phenomenon in insect-host and parasitoid-host relationships, although little studied in marine symbiotic relationships. Such a phenomenon has important implications for ecological, behavioural and physiological studies on marine symbionts in general.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of photoadaptation in the intertidal red alga Gracilaria chilensis</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Michelle Lisa Glogau</field><field name="description">The intertidal red alga, Gracilaria chilensis Bird, McLachlan et Oliveira (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales), lives in an environment in which light is highly variable in terms of both amplitude and duration. A laboratory investigation of the photophysiology of G. chilensis was conducted to assess the response of the photosynthetic apparatus to light variability characteristic of the natural environment. Freshly collected Gracilaria chilensis was found to exhibit an endogenous rhythm of photosynthesis in conditions of constant limiting light and temperature. However, such a phenomenon was not observed in saturating light. Rhythms of phycobiliprotein concentration and dark respiration were also observed but were not as well-defined and could nor account for the photosynthetic rhythm. The photosynthetic response of G. chilensis to light fluctuations of various durations (0.25 to 900 seconds) and light levels was compared to that in static light. G. chilensis was able to utilise rapidly fluctuating light (&lt; 1 second) more efficiently than fluctuations of longer duration (60-900 second). Mean photosynthetic rates were enhanced by up to l50% in fluctuating light of less than 60 sec duration over that predicted from steady-state. The photosynthetic apparatus of freshly collected G. chilensis was found to have many low-light "shade" acclimation characteristics. These included a low compensation point (5 &#181;molm-2 s-l) and onset of saturation (80 &#181;molm-2 s-l) suggesting sensitivity to photoinhibition. However, (laboratory) low-light acclimated G. chilensis was able to tolerate periods of constant high light (2000 &#181;molm-2 s-l)for periods of six hours without detectable detrimental effect on photosynthetic capacity, although photosynthetic efficiency was significantly inhibited after two hours of this treatment. The time course and characteristics of photoacclimation were determined by culturing G. chilensis in low- (15 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) and high- (180 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) light and high- and low-nitrogen regimes. The observed change in photosynthetic characteristics and pigment concentration indicated that acclimation began after a time lag of l-2 days, was complete after approximately a week and was reversible. Acclimation to growth light included changes in growth rate, P-I response curves, pigment concentration and composition and other biochemical components (e.g. carbon/nitrogen ratio). The nitrogen regime significantly affected pigment concentration in the high-light grown plants and the response suggests pigments play a role in nitrogen storage as well as light harvesting. These various physiological characteristics described above were interpreted as important mechanisms that enable G. chilensis to optimise photosynthetic response in the highly dynamic and stressful zone of the intertidal environment.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Symmetric Forced Oscillators</field><field name="creator">Ben-Tal, Alona</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study a class of symmetric forced oscillators modeled by non-linear ordinary differential equations. Solutions for this class of systems can be symmetric or non-symmetric. When a symmetric periodic solution loses its stability as a physical parameter is varied, and two non-symmetric periodic solutions appear, this is called a symmetry breaking bifurcation. In a symmetry increasing bifurcation two conjugate chaotic attractors (i.e.,attractors which are related to each other by the symmetry) collide and form a larger symmetric chaotic attractor. Symmetry can also be restored via explosions where, as a physical parameter is varied, two conjugate attractors (chaotic or periodic) which do not intersect are suddenly embedded in one symmetric attractor. In this thesis we show that all these apparently distinct bifurcations can be realized by a single mechanism in which two conjugate attractors collide with a symmetric limit set. The same mechanism seems to operate for at least some bifurcations involving non-attracting limit sets. We illustrate this point with examples of symmetry restoration in attracting and non-attracting sets found in the forced Duffing oscillator and in a power system. Symmetry restoration in the power system is associated with a phenomenon known as ferroresonance. The study of the ferroresonance phenomenon motivated this thesis. Part of this thesis is devoted to studying one aspect of the ferroresonance phenomenon the appearance of a strange attractor with a band-like structure. This attractor was called previously a 'pseudo-periodic' attractor. Some methods for analyzing the non-autonomous systems under study are shown. We construct three different maps which highlight different features of symmetry restoring bifurcations. One map in particular captures the symmetry of a solution by sampling it every half the period of the forcing. We describe a numerical method to construct a bifurcation diagram of periodic solutions and present a non-standard approach for converting the forced oscillator to an autonomous system.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variables affecting choice behaviour: choice behaviour and deprivation</field><field name="creator">Temple, William</field><field name="description">Pigeons were studied in concurrent chain schedules in which the terminal links were variable-interval (aperiodic) and fixed-interval (periodic) schedules. Choice was studied at various maintained percentages of body weight, (Experiment 1) and after various amounts of food had been pre-fed (Experiment 2). No effects on choice of the level of deprivation were found except in those choice conditions in which both terminal-link schedules were variable-interval schedules. Choice behaviour was further studied with equal, but increased magazine durations (Experiment 3) and no reliable effects were found. Explicit discrimination training established control over choice behaviour by the amounts pre-fed (Experiment 4) and generalisation gradiets of choice showed that this control was reliable. The differences found between aperiodic and periodic schedules were probably related to the different patterns of behaviour maintained by these schedules and an attempt was made to relate the results to overall models of behaviour and the 'value' of food.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Disappearing Guns of Auckland</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, John (John Stephen)</field><field name="description">The coastal fortifications of the port of Auckland, New Zealand, from 1885 to 1925 are studied in depth, from an historical archaeology perspective. An understanding of their wider context is essential to an understanding of the sites themselves, so a study is made of European artillery and fortification practice and technology from the 14th century onwards, with an emphasis on the coastal artillery practices of the British Empire in the 19th century. On this foundation, coastal fortification practices in New Zealand in the 19th century are examined, and the political background to the construction of coastal forts is outlined. The social and economic impact of the defences are studied, and the resources used in their construction detailed. Land acquisitions for the defence works in Auckland are examined. With a thorough understanding of their background and context (both national and international), Forts Resolution, Bastion, Takapuna, Victoria, Cautley and the submarine mining depots are then studied in detail, with limited excavations, extensive field survey, and the use of comprehensive archival sources. Fina1ly, it, is concluded that the forts built in Auckland between 1885 and 1925 were a product of the colonial experience, in that, they were a complex technological product of imperial demands and needs, and had little relevance to the realities and requirements of a small and remote colony 20,000 km away from the imperial centre. The thesis is a study of the &#8216;disappearing gun&#8217; period of coastal fortification, and also an acknowledgement that much of the evidence of this once socially and economically significant activity has been destroyed. To assist the reader, there is a large bibliography, and appendices containing a comprehensive glossary, a list of New zealand defence schemes from 1840 to 1914, a list of site record numbere, and biographical details of the key fort builders.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemistry of low-valent osmium</field><field name="creator">Grundy, Kevin Rodger</field><field name="description">This study concerns the synthesis, structure and reactivity of complexes of d&#8310; and d&#8312; osmium.

OsH&#8324;(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; reacts with p-tolylisocyanide (TIC) and 4-ethyl-2,6,7-trioxa-1-phosphabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (ETPO) to yield OsH&#8322;(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; from which were derived OsH&#8322;(L&#8217;)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; (L, L&#8217;=CO, TIC, ETPO). Attempts to eliminate hydrogen from the dihydrides failed. OsHCl(CO) (PPh&#8323;)&#8323; reacts with neutral ligands L (=TIC, ETPO, P(OMe)&#8323;, P(OPh)&#8323;, PPh&#8322;Me) to give OsHCl(CO)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; which, with silver perchlorate (L=TIC, ETPO only) afford OsH(OClO&#8323;)(CO)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;.

Theoretically, it draws mainly upon the concept of ideology as interpreted by Jorge Larrain but also upon Gramsci's concept of hegemony, the notion of social amnesia as presented by Jacoby and the concept of resistance as developed by Giroux. It also examines the historical development of the concepts of 'race' and 'culture' which are employed ideologically to rationalize educational policies concerning the Maori. Tracing the progression of policies and practices in Maori education from the 1830s to the present day, the research shows the schooling of the Maori to have contributed significantly to the securing of Pakeha economic and political dominance in the nineteenth century and to the maintenance of that dominance through much of the twentieth century. Of particular significance has been the control of Maori access to knowledge. With Maori resistance playing a considerable part in the shaping of these policies and practices, the school is recognized as one of the sites of Maori-Pakeha struggle. Widespread underachievement of Maori within education - revealed in 1960 by the Hunn Report - is recognized as an outcome of these processes. Taking account of policies in recent years directed at improving Maori educational achievement, the thesis examines fieldwork research conducted within Auckland primary and secondary schools, in order to understand the extent to which current policies and practices of schools contribute towards overcoming the asymmetry in social relations. Focussing upon teacher perceptions of Maori children and their needs, the way schools sort and classify their pupils, provisions for a Maori dimension in schooling, including 'taha Maori', and the place of history in social studies programmes, the research finds that the struggle still continues, with tensions surrounding the efforts of the minority of teachers and other educationists working within the education system towards Maori interests. While a significant number of teachers, particularly in primary schools seem concerned to implement the 'taha Maori' policy and other aspects of 'multicultural education', these efforts are not matched by a concern to address the problem of Maori educational under-achievement, with teachers either explaining away the problem or accepting it as a quasi-natural state of affairs. Over all the research shows that schools in general continue, in a variety of ways, to control and limit Maori access to knowledge-power and thereby help to maintain the asymmetry in Maori-Pakeha relations. Maori children who do succeed within the education system are seen to do so primarily because they and their families have learned to deal with the system. The multicultural policies of education as presented by the Department of Education are recognized as ideological responses to Maori resistance and challenges, creating an appearance of change and of commitment to Maori interests while, in essence, functioning to maintain the asymmetry in social relations.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase characterisation and kinetic studies</field><field name="creator">Cleverly, Douglas Robert</field><field name="description">Chapter One begins with an introduction to enzymology and leads into a discussion on BSSL beginning with the physical properties and the source of the enzyme. The literature concerning the kinetic properties of BSSL is reviewed, followed by a discussion on how the structure of enzymes influences their catalytic activity and specificity. The use of X-ray crystallographic techniques is addressed as a means of elucidating the three dimensional structure of enzymes. The chemicals, apparatus and standard methodologies used in this present investigation are described in Chapter Two. The means by which kinetic data measured for an enzyme-substrate system are analysed and compared are also discussed. Chapter Three describes the purification of bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase (BSSL) from whole human milk. A detailed study of the activity of the purified protein has been conducted against both lipid and ester substrates in order to monitor the progress of the purification. A further determination of the physical properties of the protein has also been conducted. Results from these studies have identified the protein as BSSL. In Chapter Four the methods used for determining the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme are described. This study has revealed interesting homologies with enzymes from other species. The sequence of that part of the enzyme which includes the active site has been determined and has been found to be identical to the consensus sequence found in the active site of pancreatic lipase, serine proteases and cholinesterases. It may therefore be postulated that the similarity observed for some of the kinetic behaviour of enzymes arises from homology in their amino acid sequences and, in particular, those portions of the protein comprising the active site. The use of kinetic isotope effects, to gain insight as to the mechanism of BSSL catalysed hydrolysis of lipid substrates, is the subject of Chapter Five. A mechanism has been proposed which explains the observed effects and takes into account information from the literature. The mechanism also incorporates findings made from the amino acid sequence study and the literature reports on the residues involved in catalysis. Chapter Six begins within a literature survey of detergent less microemulsions and continues with an account of the kinetic properties of BSSL in this new and novel medium in which enzymic reactions involving substrates of low water solubility may be conducted. The advantage of this medium is that it allows one to monitor the reaction by spectrophotometric means. In more traditional methods of assay of lipid substrates this is not normally possible. This advantage has also been exploited in the study of the kinetics of BSSL against triolein in reversed micelles, which is the subject of Chapter Seven. A detailed description is given of an FT-IR technique which allows one to monitor the course of reaction of biologically important substrates.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology of the Coromandel region with emphasis on some economic aspects</field><field name="creator">Skinner, D. N. B. (David N. B.)</field><field name="description">An account is given of the early geological exploration and mining history of the Coromandel Goldfield. The writer's interpretation of the basement and igneous geology, and of the metallogenesis of gold-silver and base metal ores has resulted in radical changes. The original threefold sub-division of the Jurassic sedimentary basement rocks (Manaia Hill Group) has been condensed to two formations (Tokatea Hill and Manaia Hill) on the basis of their detrital content and structure; standard sections are described. The older (Manaia Hill Formation) is characterised by lithic volcanic greywacke- and subgreywacke-type sedimentary rocks, that were derived from a landmass comprising an assemblage of calc-alkaline volcanic and plutonic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks. The deposit was formed by turbidity currents on a continental slope bordering a geosyncline. Secondary minerals diagnostic of low grade metamorphism of the Zeolite and Prehnite-Pumpellyite Facies occur locally in the Manaia Hill Formation. These not only include normal prehnite, laumontite-leonhardite, analcime, and actinolite, but also prehnite with anomalously low refractive indices. In contrast, the rocks of the younger formation (Tokatea Hill) are feldspathic greywackes almost devoid of volcanic detritus except near the formation boundary with Manaia Hill Formation. They have a sericiterich, authigenic matrix, but no zeolites or prehnite. The sediments were derived from a landmass of low relief composed of granodiorite-diorite plutonic rocks and minor sedimentary rocks. The lower parts of the formation are slope turbidites while the upper parts are the product of stable deposition in deeper water. The structure of the Manaia Hill Group is relatively simple over most of the Coromandel area. The beds have a north-west to north-north-west strike and are folded about axes with a similar trend; joint directions corroborate this conclusion. A north-east trend has been imposed on the rocks of the Moehau region by the intrusion of Paritu Quartz-diorite. Conformity between the two formations is shown by gradational detrital content and by structural continuity. In older descriptions, the volcanic rocks of Coromandel were subdivided into an older, gold-bearing, and a younger, barren series of andesites with minor dacites and rhyolites. By ignoring post-eruptional properties (i.e. hydrothermal alteration) a different view of the volcanic stratigraphy is demonstrated. The extrusive rocks are now subdivided into nine formations with no major regional break but with disconformity or unconformity between them caused by local quiescence. With the addition of two intrusive formations with volcanic affinities (Castle Rock Dacite and Kai-iti Porphyrites) all the volcanic rocks are included together as the Coromandel Group of Miocene age. The new effusive formations from oldest youngest are: Port Charles Andesite; Omoho Formation (rhyolitic); Kokumata Dacite; Te Karaka Andesite; Cousin Jack Andesite; Parakete Formation (dacite-andesite); Rauporoa Basaltic-andesite; Tuateawa Andesite; and Beesons Island Volcanics (andesite-dacite). The last formation has been considerably redefined since it is the sole surviving name from earlier published descriptions of the volcanic geology. Two zeolites (phillipsite and levyne) are described. Hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation cut across formation boundaries and are controlled by fault and shear zones. The writer, unlike earlier workers, recognises faults as important in the development of the geology. The fracture pattern in the basement rocks not only controls the regional fault pattern but also the fracture pattern in the volcanic rocks immediately overlying the basement. Stress patterns have been synthesised from structural analyses of faults, shears, veins, and gold-bearing lodes, which suggest that since the Mesozoic, a major compressional stress has been directed approximately north-east/south-west. A local secondary stress (north-north-west/south-south/east) is indicated during the mid-Tertiary. Major late Tertiary normal fault movement is explained by postulating horizontal tension relief by gravity following differential vertical movement along pre-existing faults, as a result of doming induced by intrusion and eruption of magma. A regional gravity survey has been tied to the known geology and structure. Models of possible mass distribution are computed for individual Bouguer anomalies. Major geological features are confirmed but stations are too spread to relate mineralisation with the gravity pattern. The results of a stream sediment reconnaissance geochemical survey of cold extractable and total copper, lead, and arsenic, are appraised in relation to known geological structural and historical features. The effects of pH, flocculants, and contamination are considered and the analytical methods reviewed. The standards of anomalous concentration levels are statistically calculated, and related to different possible sources of metal within a given terrain. Recommendations for further exploration and analytical work are made for those areas where possible economic mineralisation has been detected. In particular, the Moehau region near Paritu Quartz-diorite shows strong signs of copper enrichment. No examples of ore from any of the old mines were available; the study of the sulphide mineralisation has been confined to outcrops of veins, and samples from tip-heads. Although many of the samples show indefinite mineral relationships, the similarity of paragenetic sequence for all areas suggests that the deductions for the whole field are valid. Several minerals have not been previously recorded from Coromandel, notably wolframite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite and tetrahedrite. The structural control of mineralisation by the fracture pattern is emphasised, and also the absence of any direct genetic relationship to the volcanic rocks of the Coromandel Group. Instead, there is a zonal genetic relationship of the ore minerals of the Moehau region about Paritu Quartz-diorite. The similarity of the paragenetic sequence of other deposits to that of the Moehau region suggests similar sources, i.e. hydrothermal exhalations from consolidating subjacent granodiorite-type plutons. Whilst future economic prospects for Coromandel itself my depend on deeper workings approaching such bodies, the Paritu Quartz-diorite pluton could contain a more accessible porphyry copper deposit, with associated tungsten and molybdenum minerals.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Science/Fiction of Sex. A Feminist Deconstruction of the Vocabularies of Heterosex</field><field name="creator">Potts, Annie</field><field name="description">This research conducts a feminist poststructuralist examination of the vocabularies of heterosex: it investigates those terms, modes of talking, and meanings relating to sex which are associated with discourses such as scientific and popular sexology, medicine and psychiatry, public health, philosophy, and some feminist critique. The analysis of these various representations of heterosex involves the deconstruction of binaries such as presence/absence, mind/body, inside/outside and masculine/feminine, that are endemic to Western notions of sex. It is argued that such dualisms (re)produce and perpetuate differential power relations between men and women, and jeopardize the negotiation of mutually pleasurable and safer heterosex. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which sexological discourse deploys such dualisms as normal/abnormal, natural/unnatural, and healthy/unhealthy sex, and produces specifically gendered 'experiences' of sexual corporeality. The thesis examines a variety of written texts and excerpts from film and television; it also analyzes transcript material from individual and group interviews conducted by the researcher with heterosexual women and men, as well as sexual health and mental health professionals, in order to identify cultural pressures influencing participation in risky heterosexual behaviours, and also to identify alternative and safer pleasurable practices. Some of these alternative practices are suggested to rely on a radical reformulation of sexual relations which derives from the disruption of particular dualistic ways of understanding and enacting sex. The overall objective of the thesis is to deconstruct cultural imperatives of heterosex and promote the generation and acceptance of other modes of erotic pleasure. It is hoped that this research will be of use in the future planning and implementation of sex education and safer sex campaigns in Aotearoa/New Zealand which aim to be non-phallocentric and non-heterosexist, and which might recognize a feminist poststructuralist politics of sexual difference.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnomathematics: Exploring Cultural Diversity in Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Barton, Bill, 1948-</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a new conceptualisation of ethnomathematics which avoids some of the difficulties which emerge in the literature. In particular, work has been started on a philosophic basis for the field. There is no consistent view of ethnomathematics in the literature. The relationship with mathematics itself has been ignored, and the philosophical and theoretical background is missing. The literature also reveals the ethnocentricity implied by ethnomathematics as a field of study based in a culture which has mathematics as a knowledge category. Two strategies to over come this problem are identified: universalising the referent of &#8216;mathematics&#8217; so that it is the same as &#8220;knowledge-making&#8221;; or using methodological techniques to minimise it. The position of ethnomathematics in relationship to anthropology, sociology, history, and politics is characterised on a matrix. A place for ethnomathematics is found close the anthropology of mathematics, but the aim of anthropology is to better understand culture in general, while ethnomathematics aims to better understand mathematics. Anthropology, however, contributes its well-established methodologies for overcoming ethnocentricity. The search for a philosophical base finds a Wittgensteinian orientation which enables culturally based &#8216;systems of meaning&#8217; to gain credibility in mathematics. A definition is proposed for ethnomathematics as the study of mathematical practices within context. Four types of ethnomathematical activity are identified: descriptive, archaeological, mathematising, and analytical activity. The definition also gives rise to a categorisation of ethnomathematical work along three dimensions: the closeness to conventional mathematics; the historical time; and the type of host culture. The mechanisms of interaction between mathematical practices are identified, and the imperialistic growth of mathematics is explained. Particular features of ethnomathematical theory are brought out in a four examples. By admitting the legitimacy of other viewpoints, ethnomathematics opens mathematics to new creative forces. Within education, ethnomathematics provides new choices, and turns cultural conflict into a useful tool for teaching. Mathematical activity exists in a variety of contexts. Learning mathematics involves being aware of, and integrating, diverse concepts. Ethnomathematics expands mathematical horizons, so that cultural diversity becomes a richer contributor to the cultural structures which humans use to understand their world.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signalling mechanisms coordinating nutritional status and lactation</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Kevin William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General practice consultation and outcome: a social analysis of the patient practitioner encounter</field><field name="creator">Raymont, Antony</field><field name="description">The thesis examines general medical practice with particular attention to patient outcomes. Sociological descriptions of healing are presented and compared with official views of medical institutions. A theoretical position is taken capable of interaction with the disciplines of both sociology and medicine. Definitions of health are reviewed and used to specify desirable outcomes to patient-practitioner encounters. The context of modern medical care is then discussed; the influence of the intellectual, social and economic environment on the development of medical care since 1800 are evaluated, and modern reformist pressure on medical practice is examined. From this discussion a list of qualities of interest in the sociological investigation of medical practice is developed. A research project, undertaken in New Zealand, is described which gathered information on a random sample of 9477 general practice patient-practitioner encounters. A survey methodology was used with data supplied by practitioners. In addition, a patient survey was carried out in a sub-sample of 763 visits. Data on practitioner, patient, problem presented, process of the encounter and outcome was recorded. Outcome was measured as empowerment at the visit and improvement after two weeks. The results of the project are presented and analyzed. It was found that most patients are satisfied with their consultation and that a majority have improved health state at two weeks. Much of the variation in improvement is explained by the severity of the problem and the age of the patient. Social variables make a small contribution to the prediction of good outcomes. In particular, empowerment at the consultation is related to improved subsequent health state. The influence of occupation, gender and ethnicity on problems presented to the practitioner and on outcome are discussed. A proportion of patients had delayed obtaining medical care for financial reasons. This was associated with more severe problems and poorer outcome. A psycho-social approach to problems was rare and patient counseling did not appear to contribute to a sense of empowerment. Practitioners reported highest rapport with simpler consultations and rapport was negatively related to empowerment. The significance of these findings is discussed. In a final section it is suggested that medical treatment and counseling may be antithetical skills and that both practitioner and patient may have vested interests in a materialistic view of the content of their interaction. The forms of social control implicit in the encounter are elaborated.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in organisational design in New Zealand privatised organisations</field><field name="creator">Erakovi&#263;, Ljiljana</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary Developments in Catholic Missiology : the Story of the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions of the Province of Aotearoa New Zealand, 1861-2000</field><field name="creator">Smith, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

Electrophoresis of the AMPs extracted from a selection of Demospongiae showed that most of the AMPs typical of vertebrate connective tissues were present. No evidence was found in this study to suggest a possible role whereby the presence or absence of sulphated AMPs could be of use in sponge taxonomy. Histochemical studies on the cytological localization of AMPs in both adult tissues and developing larvae also failed to provide any evidence to support the previous hypothesis that AMP localization could be used as an aid in the classification of the Demospongiae. Ultrastructural studies on the localization of AMPs indicated several mechanisms whereby AMPs could contribute to sponge cohesion. The AMPs associated with collagen fibrils were found to be arranged in a way essentially similar to that already described for mammals, and various other lines of evidence confirm the similarity of the sponge mesohyl to vertebrate connective tissue. There is, however, no need to imply a direct evolutionary relationship. The possible role of AMPs in both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion has been examined in detail. Evidence is presented for the existence of an aggregation factor in Microciona coccinea. The factor has been shown to be a proteoglycan in a closely related species of sponge, and although conclusive evidence on the role of factor is lacking it is interpreted by many workers to be a surface attached molecule involved in adhesion. No evidence was obtained in this study to confirm localization of the factor at the sponge cell surface, but this may be a result of limitations in present ultrastructural techniques. Initial cell contact in cell-cell adhesion during aggregation was seen to occur in the regions of narrow extensions of the plasmalemmae termed membrane bridges. Structures of this sort have been proposed on physical grounds as one means by which cells may overcome the electric repulsive barrier between them to make adhesion by ionic bridging. Adhesion to the substrate in metamorphosing sponge larvae was seen to be mediated by a groundmat which is believed to be secreted by the larva, and which contains a granular component as well as collagen and fine filaments. The role of junctions in cell-cell adhesion was examined in detail in adult sponges and in aggregated cells. The presence of the cell junctions characteristic of other organisms could not be convincingly demonstrated in sponge tissues, and it seems probable that structures other than the typical cell junctions may be involved in communication and adhesion within sponges. An unusual AMP surface coat &#8211; the larval coat &#8211; is described from the surface of the T-pinacocytes in metamorphosing larvae of Halichondria moorei. The similarity of this coat in some respects to the fuzzy surface coat of amoebae is noted, and some of its possible functions are discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucose Transporters in Diabetic Complications of the Lens</field><field name="creator">Merriman-Smith, B. Rachelle</field><field name="description">Lens transparency is primarily maintained by the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. Glucose is transported from the aqueous humuor to the lens epithelial cells however, it has not yet been established how glucose penetrates to the inner part of the lens. The core of the lens is acidic, approximately pH 6.5, as an effect of the accumulation of lactate, the end-product of glycolysis. This confirms that glucose is drawn deep into the core of the lens. Until recently it was assumed that glucose was transported to the core via a gap junction-mediated route by cell-cell diffusion. However, passive diffusion is limited in capacity and is unlikely to be sufficient for nutrient transport especially for larger lenses. Instead, an active circulation system has been proposed that has the potential to transport glucose deep into the lens via an extracellular route. This would imply that fibre cells may have evolved their own glucose uptake system, yet no direct evidence to this effect has been available. My thesis describes new molecular evidence that both epithelial and fibre cells have evolved their own glucose uptake system. The rat lens expresses the facilitative glucose transporters GLUTI and GLUT3 differentially. GLUTI is predominantly expressed in the epithelium while GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in the fibre cells of the lens. In the normal lens, this makes good physiological sense. GLUTI has a high Km suitable for situations of high glucose concentrations, as is the case for the epithelium where the aqueous humour mirrors glucose concentrations found in blood. GLUT3 has a lower Km and is particularly suitable for the fibre cells, where the supply of glucose from the tortuous extracellular space is limited. The discovery of GLUT3 in the fibre cells lends strong support for the existence of an active circulation system in the lens and makes it seem unlikely that glucose is transported into the core via gap junction-mediated diffusion. In the diabetic state, sorbitol - a product of glucose metabolism, occurs at elevated levels of about 30 times more than that of the normal, suggesting a significant increase in glucose uptake. This imposes an osmotic stress on the lens, which can be countered by regulated cell volume decrease only in the outer but not in the inner cortex. As a consequence inner cortex tissue breaks down and opacities result. My studies of the diabetic rat lens shows that the situation is made worse by an apparent up-regulation of GLUT3 in the fibre cells. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that the GLUT3 transcript is up-regulated six-fold during the initial weeks of diabetic insult in the streptozotocin rat model. The up-regulated GLUT3 protein is detected in the region where maximum tissue damage occurs. These results suggest a new mechanism for the initial tissue damage in the diabetic lens, whereby increased uptake of glucose leads to an over-production of sorbitol which causes osmotic stress on the fibre cells that is beyond their defense capability of regulated cell volume decrease. While my results described above have revolutionized our view of nutrient transport in the lens and its potential role in the early stages of diabetic cataract, the picture is only complete when the functionality of GLUT3 can be demonstrated. For this purpose, vesicles were prepared from isolated lens fibre cells and subjected to quantitative uptake studies using a fluorescent glucose derivative. Uptake was greatly reduced using the GLUT-specific inhibitor phloretin demonstrating that GLUT3 of the rat lens fibre cells is indeed fully functional. In summary, my results add a new dimension to our understanding of how the lens maintains homeostasis and tissue transparency. The lens has evolved an ingenious system to supply, nutrients to the core region to compensate for the absence of a vasculature. However, by achieving this, it has rendered itself unable to defend itself against the adverse effects of high glucose. My results also contribute towards developing new strategies of rational drug design to prevent or delay cataract.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tastant interactions with model membranes</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Patricia</field><field name="description">A wide range of compounds elicit the sweet taste response but currently it is not known what causes this response. In Chapter 3 a number of sweeteners, and representatives of all the taste groups are investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The T1 relaxation times of the tastants were determined in aqueous solution and in solution with liposomes, a model membrane system. The observed changes in T1, values are analysed to determine which regions of the tastants are involved in the interaction with the membrane. In Chapters 4 and 5 an investigation is reported of the interaction of tastants with a liquid membrane system, which is reportedly able to distinguish between classes of chemicals. The interest lies in developing a simple experiment that will enable taste qualities to be predicted, something that is currently not possible. In Chapters 6 and 7 the NMR assignments of some sweeteners is discussed. NMR assignments are a necessary precursor before their sweetening properties can be studied by NMR.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional Expertise: A Model for Integration and Change</field><field name="creator">Yielder, Jill</field><field name="description">The nature of professional expertise has been widely debated in the literature. However it has been examined primarily from a dichotomy of perspectives - either from an experiential or a cognitive focus, without the attempt to integrate these, and other aspects of expertise, into an integrated and coherent model. This research is structured in two sections. The first part incorporates a philosophical discussion, which advances an integrated model of professional expertise. The second part uses a case study focused on the field of medical imaging to illustrate and refine the model. Ten professionals identified as experts in the various sub-specialties within medical imaging were guided through a sustained period of interviews and logging of critical incidents in order to elicit in-depth data in relation to the process of expertise. Findings showed that while expertise is situated in the context of practice, it incorporates several dimensions working together in an integrated, seamless fashion through the medium of the individual practitioner. The proposed model integrates five main aspects, namely: knowledge base; cognitive processes; internal integrative processes; interpersonal relationships; and professional practice. That is, it is a synthesis of a particular knowledge base, the cognitive processes, personality and internal processes of the practitioner. It manifests through, and builds on, interpersonal relationships with clients and other professionals, and is expressed through the actual doing of professional practice. It is through the reflexive examination of practice and management of change that professionals may transform these five integrated aspects into the qualitative state of expertise. One of the implications of these findings for higher education are that institutions providing professional education need to value all the dimensions of expertise and their effective integration in order to promote the learning required to advance professionals towards this level of practice.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrolysis of amides and ureas in acid solutions</field><field name="creator">Giffney, Carolyn Janet</field><field name="description">Despite the vast amount of research reported on the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of amides, the mechanism of reaction has remained a source of controversy. The various literature results have been summarised in the introduction. Two series of amides have been studied in this investigation, one a series of N-substituted, 4-chlorobenzamides, the other a series of substituted acetanilides. Their basicity (or acid-dissociation) constants have been evaluated in sulphuric acid, and the rates of hydrolysis measured over a wide range of acid concentrations. Within each series, variation of the substituent causes the rate constant to vary in a way which is typical of a bimolecular reaction involving rate-determining nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated intermediate. By drawing a comparison between the two series of amides, (i.e. the difference in basicities and rates of hydrolysis) it becomes apparent that the 0-protonated amide, which is thermodynamically favoured, is not the kinetically active species, A new rate equation is proposed, the equation being based on a mechanism in which water attacks the carbonyl carbon in the rate-determining step. The equation confidently predicts the experimental rate-profiles for the acid-hydrolysis of simple amides. It has been applied, in two forms, to the experimental rate data; the first form allows for the involvement of three water molecules in the slow step of hydrolysis, and the second form allows for the involvement of only two water molecules. The rate equation, in these two forms, has also been applied to much of the hydrolysis data reported in the literature and again it has proved to be very successful. In contrast to the amides, ureas have not been subjected to extensive research. In this investigation, the basicity constants of a series of substituted phenylureas have been measured, (if not already available) and the hydrolysis reactions carried out over a wide range of sulphuric acid concentrations, as well as in water. The 4-methyl and 4-chloro-phenylureas have also been hydrolysed in a range of hydrochloric and perchloric acid solutions; the effects of added salt were studied and the solvent isotope effects on the rate were evaluated. All these results, together with information obtained from application of the Hammett equation to the rate data, were in agreement with a mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium protonation to form the minor, N-protonated conjugate acid. This is followed by a slow transfer of the proton attached to the alternate nitrogen atom to form the appropriately substituted phenylisocyanate, and rapid reaction of this intermediate to form products. The substituent effects on the n.m.r. spectra of the substituted acetanilides and phenylureas have also been reported.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHESS: Chief Executive Stress Survival: a study of occupational stress in New Zealand top management</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Paul F.</field><field name="description">This study develops and used a CHESS (chief Executive Stress Survival) model developed from the occupational stress literature to predict variations in the psychological and physical stress experience and health risk of chief Executives of New Zealand organisations. The model proposes that stress is a sequential process with identifiable phases and that variation are mainly due to the frequency of environmental experiences and stressor factors which are both &#8220;chronic&#8221; and &#8220;episodic&#8221;, &#8220;at work&#8221; and &#8220;outside work&#8221;. The model also assumes, however, that the impact of the environmental variables and stressor factors are moderated by individual personality differences, coping mechanisms and stress management practices. The model was tested on a sample of 107 male chief Executive officers and General Managers. It was found that the majority of the sample (80%) were relatively stress resistant and healthy. Stepwise multiple regression was used to test the model, and some evidence derived suggests that the frequency of environmental problems does predict various stress symptoms and that environmental stressors ultimately predict health risk profiles. Individual differences are shown as being largely independent variables predicting stress, rather that being moderating variables as suggested by the model. Coping and stress management variables are also shown to play a significant moderating role in the stress - outcome relationship. Some evidence derived suggests that there may be individual manager profiles, provisionally labelled &#8220;stress immune&#8221; vs &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and &#8220;ill - health preventers&#8221; vs &#8220;non-preventers&#8221;.

The extracts were incubated with radiolabelled tryptophan and other substrates and cofactors thought to be involved in indoleacetic acid biosynthesis. After incubation indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid were separated and quantified by HPLC. There was no significant difference in the conversion of tryptophan to indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid between the incubations and control incubations using boiled extract. The concentrations of indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid in mung bean hypocotyl suspension cultures were measured using GC-MS SIM over the growth of the culture, a period of 29 days. Indoleacetic acid concentrations, although scattered, mostly remained at constant low levels in the range of 6 to 9ng/g fwt of culture. The indolepyruvate levels steadily increased to a maximum level after 14 days, then remained at this level, 10 to 12 ng/g fwt, for the remainder of the culture period. This plateau in indolepyruvate concentration matched the period that the suspension culture was in the logarithmic phase of growth. An aromatic amino acid aminotransferase was purified over 33,000 fold from the shoots and primary leaves of mung beans, as determined using a tryptophan aminotransferase activity assay. The enzyme was a monomer, with a molecular weight of about 58kDa. The pH optimum was broad, with a maximum at about 8.6. The relative activities of the aromatic amino acids were: tryptophan 100, tyrosine 83 and phenylalanine 75, and the Kms were 0.095, 0.08 and 0.07mM respectively. The enzyme was able to use 2-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate as the oxo acid substrate at relative activities 100, 128 and 116 and Kms 0.65, 0.25 and 0.24mM respectively In addition to the aromatic amino acids the enzyme was able to transaminate alanine, arginine, leucine and lysine to a lesser extent, and showed slight activity with asparagine, aspartate, histidine, valine and D-tryptophan and tyrosine. Inhibition studies showed that the alanine, aspartate and histidine activities were part of the aromatic amino acid aminotransferase activity. The enzyme was not inhibited by indoleacetic acid, although naphthaleneacetic acid did inhibit slightly. There was evidence of substrate inhibition by hydroxyphenylpyruvate at high concentrations. Addition of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate only slightly increased the activity of the enzyme. The enzyme was blotted onto a PVDF membrane cleaved by in situ trypsin digest. Three of the tryptic fragments were sequenced. These fragments had approximately 60% sequence similarity with plant aspartate aminotransferases and tyrosine aminotransferases.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the Risks of Ageing: The Role of Private Pensions and Annuities within a Comprehensive Retirement Policy for New Zealand</field><field name="creator">St. John, Susan, 1945-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340209 Public sector economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Worlds in Collision: The Gay Debate in New Zealand 1960-86</field><field name="creator">Guy, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the public debate on homosexuality in New Zealand in the period 1960-86. Its focus is primarily on male homosexuality because the central issue was the continued criminalization of male same-sex sexual acts. The thesis notes irresolvable problems of definition of homosexuality involving discussions of behaviour, orientation and identity. Nevertheless, the debate proceeded on a binary basis, that homosexuals and heterosexuals were two clearly defined groups of people. The thesis begins by noting the repression and invisibility of homosexuals in the 1960s. It then explores the origins and significance of the New Zealand Homosexual Law Reform Society and the gay liberation movement. Because of the significance of religion in regard to the debate, a chapter is devoted to major change and cleavage that occurred within the churches relating to homosexuality in the period reviewed. Finally the intense fifteen months of debate that occurred prior to decriminalization of male homosexual activity in July 1986 is studied at depth. The thesis highlights the intensity of feeling that the debate engendered. This was the result of the clash of fundamentally different worldviews and value systems. Behind the particular issue lay the question of the moral and social status of homosexuals and homosexual acts. So fundamental was this division that from both sides the very future of society seemed to be at stake.

This thesis investigates how closely the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities in New Zealand approximated this ideal during the 1990s. Its particular focus is on how the neo-liberal ideology of National and Coalition Governments between 1990 and 1999, and those Governments' understandings of the nature and political significance of ethnicity, affected the ability of those belonging to non-Maori ethnic minority groups to be full and equal members of the New Zealand political community, with an equal capacity for self-governance at the individual level and as members of the political community. The thesis takes the form of a survey of public policy and law over a period of nine years. Five broad areas or aspects of public policy are examined: the collection and dissemination of official 'ethnic' statistics; immigration and citizenship policy; civil rights provided for in domestic and international law; mechanisms for ensuring access to political decision-making; and social policy. The question asked in the thesis is whether the policies developed and administered in each of these areas during the 1990s enriched or detracted from the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Triton X Series Nonionic Surfactant Solutions</field><field name="creator">Qiao, Lijun</field><field name="description">This work contains some fundamental investigations on Triton X series nonionic surfactants from different aspects. Techniques, such as viscometry, densimetry, diffusion measurement, ultra-violet spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry, surface tension measurement and optical microscopy were employed to acquire the information. Some theoretical analyses were given to the results of these measurements. Triton X surfactants show different properties when they dissolve in different solvents. Aggregation can occur in some solvents, depending on the interactions between solvent and solute. The addition of a surfactant to a solvent will give rise to a solute-solvent interaction and change the solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions as well. From mass transport properties of the surfactant solutions, these interactions were studied and the contributions to them from each species of the solutions were calculated with a transition-state theory model which is usually used for small molecule systems. Under some reasonable assumptions, a new theoretical method was set up and was able to give a reasonable explanation for the experimental results. The surfactants can also associate with some dyes in both polar and apolar media. The ultra-violet spectra of the surfactant-dye solutions show that surfactant-dye complexes might be formed in the polar and apolar media where the surfactants form regular and reversed micelles respectively. The mechanism of the complexation reactions was studied with equilibrium theory and the charge-transfer nature of the association between the surfactant and dye revealed. The surface tension and. cloud point changes due to the addition of polyethylene glycol were determined to discover the interaction between the water-soluble polymer PEG and the surfactants at the air-solution interface and in the bulk solutions respectively. The mass distribution of the two materials between the two phases produced in the segregation (at the cloud point) of the solutions were determined by their ultra-violet adsorption spectra and densities. The analysis of the cloud point changes was given with the new concepts of polysoap and depletion flocculation. The results show that the size of the micelles, the length of the polymer chains, and the structures of the intra - chain micelles can change the mechanisms of polymer-surfactant interaction and influence the properties of the polymer/surfactant solutions. In a certain range of concentrations, the surfactants aqueous solutions can form liquid crystalline structures which can be observed under a cross-polarised microscope and determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The phase diagrams and their variations with additions of the third component, such as xylene, polyethylene glycol and BaCl2 2H2O have been determined. The effects of temperature and each of the additives on the ordered structures were analysed separately in the light of concepts of spontaneous mean curvature and "salting out" effect. Osmotic coefficients of the surfactant aqueous and methanol solutions were determined with a vapour pressure osmometer, and the activity coefficient of the solvent can be calculated with the osmotic coefficients. The change of the activity coefficient with increase of surfactant concentration shows the interactions of the surfactant with the solvent. In aqueous solution, the addition of surfactant frees the solvent molecules, leading to an activity coefficient larger than 1. In methanol solution, the surfactant addition reduces the fugacity of methanol molecules, resulting in an activity coefficient less than 1. Chemical shift changes of protons of the surfactant molecules in the lH NMR spectra show some information about the configuration of the chains, hydration, and phase structure of the solution system when the surfactant concentration changes over the whole concentration range. From 40% w/w the associated water molecules begin to be lost, and the association number ratio of water molecules and the ethylene oxide unit of the surfactant is 4:1. Electric conductance of electrolytes in the surfactant aqueous solutions are reduced by the addition of the surfactants. The reduction is more significant for large size cations, and the longer the EO chain of the surfactant, the larger the reducing effect on conductance.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65279;First language attrition in a second language learning environment: the case of Korean-English late bilinguals</field><field name="creator">Kim, Sun Hee</field><field name="description">This thesis explores L1 attrition among young Korean-English late bilinguals. Thirty Korean immigrants to New Zealand, who had arrived at the age of 12-13 years and had spent at least 2 years in New Zealand, participated in the study. Ten monolingual Korean children aged 12 years served as a comparison group for L1 data. Linguistic data in both L1 and L2 were elicited by a standardised picture-naming test and a story-retelling task supplemented by a stimulated recall protocol. Information related to social variables and language use patterns was elicited through a questionnaire and interviews. Skehan (1996; 1998; 2001) proposes three dimensions of linguistic performance&#8212; accuracy, fluency, and complexity. The general findings suggest that accuracy and lexical diversity in L1 are most susceptible to attrition and that there is general positive transfer from L1 to L2 skills. While there is no direct negative interaction between L1 and L2 proficiency, analysis reveals that increasing L2 fluency and a decrease in L1 use have possible indirect effects on attrition in L1 accuracy but not in L1 lexical diversity. The data suggest that, while the frequency of return visits to the homeland is an important social variable, language use involving the father and siblings is also an important factor in attrition or maintenance of L1 proficiency of adolescent late bilinguals. Qualitative analysis conducted on five cases corroborates the quantitative findings. Analyses of speech samples reveal that synthetic structures with semantic ambiguity are most susceptible to L1 attrition. The qualitative analysis also highlights the role of L2 socialisation in L1 attrition in adolescent immigrant children who negotiate their language use and identities in an L2-dominant environment and show different patterns of attrition in their L1.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420119 Korean</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of giant Kerr nonlinearity</field><field name="creator">Rebic, Stojan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the properties of an atomic system exhibiting a giant Kerr nonlinearity. The atomic energy level scheme involves four energy levels. A three level A subsystem in the atom exhibits the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), reducing the spontaneous emission noise. The fourth level leads to an ac-Stark shift of the ground state, which in turn leads to a giant, noiseless Kerr nonlinearity. Two different environments are explored. First, a system comprising of large number of atoms in an optical cavity is analysed. Detailed aspects of noise reduction in this system are investigated. In particular, strong squeezing in the quadrature in phase with the field driving the cavity mode is found, if the effective coupling of light to the atoms is strong. However, the linewidth of the predicted squeezing is found to be very narrow. This is attributed to a very steep linear susceptibility of the atomic medium. Since the widening of the squeezing window is possible only for weaker effective coupling, in turn reducing the squeezing level, a different environment is proposed. This involves a single four level atom, strongly coupled to the cavity mode. In such a strongly coupled system, the most appropriate approach is found to be that formulated in terms of polaritons &#8211; composite excitations of the 'atom-cavity molecule'. Adopting the polariton approach, nonclassical correlations in the field leaving the cavity are investigated. Strong photon antibunching is found and the effect of photon blockade predicted and described. The photon blockade effect can also be found in a system comprised of a two level atom coupled to the cavity mode, if the external driving is tuned to one of the vacuum Rabi resonances. A comparison between the two schemes is performed, and it is found that the four level scheme exhibits much better photon blockade. The reason for this is quantum interference between secondary transitions in the dressed states picture. Destructive interference cancels the transitions that would otherwise introduce a second photon into the system, hence producing a more robust photon blockade. All of these results are valid in the regime where external driving is weak. If the external driving strength is increased, the photon statistics (as measured by the zero-delay second order correlation function) changes from strong antibunching to strong bunching, over a relatively narrow range of driving strengths. The occurrence of this change can again be attributed to quantum interference. It is shown that the interference effect prevents the excitation of the composite system by a second photon, but not excitation by a two-photon transition (following the first excitation). Therefore, the third excitation manifold is excited, which then decays back to the first manifold in a two photon cascade. This two photon cascade is the source of correlated photon pairs causing an increase in the second order correlation function. The dynamics of forward scattering of light is presented, and nonclassical behaviour of the delay dependence of correlation function ('overshoots' and 'undershoots') is discussed. For the analytical treatment of this system, a method based on the polariton approach is devised, which includes the treatment of driving and damping. It is shown that this method is ideally suited to the analysis of strongly coupled systems, where only a few photons contribute to the dynamics.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and applied behaviour analysis</field><field name="creator">Wardlaw, Grant Ronald</field><field name="description">It is often claimed that applied behaviour analysis is founded on basic behavioural concepts involving the direct extrapolation of data from the experimental laboratory to the analysis of human behaviour. It is claimed that such an approach gives theoretical coherence to a set of procedures, and avoids the pitfalls associated with a collection of unrelated techniques. This presumed experimental base is said to make applied behaviour analysis more rigorous, more effective, more systematic, and easier to teach and learn than other approaches to the modification of human behaviour. There is reason to believe, however, that the link between experimental and applied behaviour analysis is more one of commitment than reality. Previous authors have shown that research findings from the experimental analysis of behaviour are becoming increasingly isolated from other areas of psychology in general. The present study provides evidence that such findings are also isolated from applied behaviour analysis in particular. Experimental data are seldom cited in applied work and, when they are, it is seldom specific or current data to which references are made. It is argued that this state of affairs is attributable to the acceptance, by applied behaviour analysis, of a model of behaviour whose complexity is insufficient to cope with the complex interactive nature of human behaviour. The present work provides an outline of the current applied behaviour analytic model, and then proceeds to discuss some of the major types of data of which the model takes no significant account. An extensive examination of data from the experimental analysis of choice behaviour is given, which reveals the level of complexity to which application may be made. Suggestions as to the practical utilization of these data are made, with particular reference to the areas of self-control and commitment. A case study involving the use of a commitment procedure in the treatment of an exhibitionist and another concerning the application of experimentally-derived procedures to a self-control problem, provide clinical evidence of the usefulness of the direct incorporation of experimental data. Following these applied case studies, a number of other areas of experimental research are examined with respect to their relevance to applied behaviour analysis. Significant data from the study of multiple-schedule interactions, stimulus control, and two specific types of analyses of reinforcement phenomena are outlined and suggestions made concerning their applied potential. Further, data which could determine the limits of the applicability of experimental data, in the context of biological constraints on behaviour, are shown to be capable of further increasing the utility of applied behaviour analytic techniques. Finally, the implications of the data analyzed are discussed in terms of the future training of applied behaviour analysts.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control in pigeons with forebrain lesions</field><field name="creator">Wild, John Martin</field><field name="description">Lesions were placed in several areas of the telencephalon and diencephalon of the brain of the pigeon and the effects on the acquisition of inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were observed. The experimental tasks consisted of both visual and auditory interdimensional discriminations each of which had two components: In the first the stimuli were presented successively on the one response key (the main key) according to a multiple variable-interval extinction schedule. In the second the multiple schedule still obtained but a changeover key was added which, when pecked, changed the main-key stimulus, together with its associated schedule of reinforcement, to the next in a randomly ordered series. The use of these two components allowed the separation of two aspects of inhibitory control in learning: response reduction and stimulus reduction thereby permitting the assessment of discriminative ability in the absence of the confounding factor of response reduction. Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were assessed by post-discrimination generalization tests and combined-cue tests, respectively. It was found that lesions to areas considered limbic - hippocampus, septum, anterior dorsomedial thalamus - had no effect on the learning of a visual discrimination. Lesions to the dorsolateral thalamus produced a complete inability to learn this discrimination, presumably due to disruption of visual fibres en route to the telecephalon. Lesions to the Wulst produced a visual discrimination learning deficit in some birds but not in others, an inconsistency not accounted for by differences in lesion size. Wulst lesions also produced an auditory discrimination learning deficit and in this case the larger the lesion, the larger the deficit. Lesions to ectostriatum produced a deficit in the visual task and lesions to Field L, an auditory projection area, produced a deficit in the auditory task, but not in the visual task. However, in most cases the discrimination learning deficit which was produced was confined to the multiple schedule where the animal had no control over the presentation or duration of the stimuli. Once the changeover key was introduced most birds obtained the learning criterion very quickly by "switching out" of the negative stimulus. This effective changeover responding, together with unimpaired inhibitory dimensional or inhibitory stimulus control, suggested that although the initial learning deficit might be described in terms of an inability to withhold responding in the presence of stimuli previously correlated with reinforcement, this inability could not readily be explained in terms of a lesion-induced impairment in an inhibitory process.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of biologically active natural products - Texaline, Pseudopyronines A and B, and Varacin</field><field name="creator">Giddens, Anna Claire</field><field name="description">SAR studies on two classes of natural products, namely the terrestrial natural product texaline (2.1) and the marine derived natural products pseudopyronines A (3.64) and B (3.65) are described, as are chemical genetics studies using the cytotoxic marine natural product varacin (4.30a). The biological activities of these natural products and synthetic analogues were assessed in a variety of assays. A general methodology was developed that led to the first reported synthesis of texaline. Screening of texaline and related compounds found the oxazole natural product to be inactive against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while oxazole 2,5- diphenyloxazole (2.86) was found to possess modest antitubercular activity. In order to develop oxazoles with enhanced biological activity, analogues of 2,5- diphenyloxazole were synthesized and tested against M. tuberculosis. All structural modifications to the 2,5-diphenyloxazole scaffold resulted in diminished activity. Consequently, 2,5-diphenyloxazole remains the most active of the oxazoles prepared to date. Pseudopyronines A and B were synthesized for the first time, via CDImediated condensation of alkyl  -keto carboxylic acids. The natural products and related compounds were tested in a range of biological assays. Pyrones 3.64, 3.65 and 3.107 possessed the most potent antitubercular activity. Pseudopyronines A and B and analogues were also assessed for activity against several tropical diseases. None of the compounds exhibited significant activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi or T. brucei rhodesiense. However pyrones 3.107 and 3.105 exhibited significant in vitro activity against Leishmania donovani. Varacin (4.30b), isolated from the New Zealand ascidian Lissoclinum notti, was tested in a zebrafish embryo assay along with its N-Boc protected derivative 4.30d and analogue DMPE (4.69). Dosing zebrafish embryos with varacin and Bocvaracin at increasing concentrations afforded phenotypic changes in the embryos. Boc-varacin proved more potent than varacin in the assay, while DMPE was inactive making it a suitable negative control. Varacin and DMPE were attached to Sepharose 4B and the resulting matrices utilized in affinity chromatography experiments with the aim of uncovering varacin protein target(s). To visualize the distribution of varacin within the zebrafish embryo, attachment of fluorescent labels to DMPE and varacin was investigated. Varacin also underwent animal testing at the NCI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Hordeum vulgare-H bulbosum recombinants using cytological and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Liangtao</field><field name="description">Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare) is an important crop and ranks fourth in overall production of the major cereal crops in the world. Like other cereal crops, barley suffers from a narrowing of its genetic base and susceptibility to diseases, pests and environmental stresses. H. bulbosum is a possible source of desirable genes for introgressing into barley to restore genetic diversity and improve current cultivars. Sexual hybridisation between barley and H. bulbosum is the main method for interspecific gene transfer in barley breeding but there are several barriers to overcome. Two of these are reduced recombination and the ability to identify recombinants quickly and efficiently. The aim in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of meiotic chromosomal behaviour in the two species and their hybrids and to improve the characterisation of recombinants from the hybrids. To study the events during meiosis, synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis was carried out on the two species and two H. vulgare - H. bulbosum hybrids. The results indicated that there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in SC length. Mean SC length was positively correlated with recombination frequency but not related to genome size. This suggests that the ratios of mean SC length to genome size (SC/DNA) show divergence among these Hordeum examples. An hypothesis based on the conformation of chromatin associated with axial element, which is dependent on SC/DNA ratio, was presented to explain the relationship between SC length and recombination frequency. Chromosome pairing in the two hybrids was determined by observation at pachytene and metaphase I (MI). Mean percentages of synapses were similar but there were different frequencies of MI pairing between these two hybrids, indicating that different mechanisms may regulate synapsis and MI pairing in the hybrids. To investigate meiotic recombination, genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) was performed on the two hybrids at MI and anaphase I (AI). It was observed that intergenomic pairing and recombination events occur in distal chromosome segments. A great discrepancy between mean pairing and recombination frequencies was observed in both hybrids and several possible reasons for this discrepancy were discussed. Hybrid 102C2 with high MI pairing had a significantly higher recombination frequency than the low pairing 103K5, suggesting that high MI pairing appears to be associated with high recombination in the hybrids. An interesting finding is that the ratio of recombination to MI pairing in 103K5 (l:8.9) is twice as high compared with 102C2 (l:17). However, the mechanism for this difference in the ratio between the two hybrids remains unknown. Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and GISH were used successfully to localise the introgressions in selfed progeny from a tetraploid hybrid derived from chromosome-doubled 102C2 (102C2/colch). This procedure is fast, cheap and can efficiently detect and locate introgressions. Several disease-resistant recombinants were analysed in more details and leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance was associated with distal introgressions on chromosomes 2HS and 2HL (leaf rust) and 2HS (powdery mildew). It is possible that the leaf rust and powdery mildew resistances were closely linked in the distal region of 2HS. A considerable variation in introgression size was observed at similar chromosomal sites among the different recombinants, which will provide useful information for map-based cloning of genes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270209 Meiosis and recombination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Diaries of Genevi&#232;ve Br&#233;ton 1874-1914</field><field name="creator">Burnet, Catherine Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and occupational mobility among farm employees</field><field name="creator">Loveridge, Alison, 1955-</field><field name="description">Class mobility in farming works both ways, some farmer's children are unable to afford a farm, while others from non-farm families do succeed in farm ownership. The literature reviewed in this thesis suggests this situation is related to New Zealand's economic history. In the past small family farms have benefited from both secure markets and governments whose interests have been closely bound up with high productivity. This has led the state to offer cheap credit to prospective farmers with little cap1al of their own. Upward mobility has been possible, but at the same time state support has enabled relatively small farms to remain viable, and many of these are unable to secure farm ownership for all family members. In this thesis I explore class mobility and career patterns among farm employees and consider their wider implications. There are many ambiguities in farm employment in New Zealand which stem from the predominance of petty bourgeois farm owners. Such farmers must deal with the capitalist markets of other sectors when they purchase inputs or sell their product but family workers may act as a bulwark against commercial pressures by accepting lower incomes. Similar conditions may be forced on working class farm employees with no chance of ownership. The high number of people leaving farm employment offers indirect confirmation of such problems and this thesis investigates the context in which departures occurred. Farm employees consist of three groups, those without interest in farm ownership, those with an interest and little chance of success, and those whose family background ensures farm ownership. Many farms only have one employee and take on non-family labour for short periods when the family labour which would otherwise do the task is unavailable. Some of the people they employ are offspring of neighbouring farm owners. This variation in class interests has exacerbated the disinclination of farm employees to lake collective action in the face of poor wages and conditions. By tracing a sample of farm employees through the electoral rolls over a period of ten years, I have been able to contact three groups of farm employees: those who have left for non-farm work in the intervening period; those who have been farm workers for at least ten years; and those who have since become farm owners. This has given me an insight into the proportion of farm employees who take up farming hoping to own their own farm, and the problems involved in succeeding. People who have left farming also provide an important perspective on farm employment. I have correlated outcome of career by various background factors, principally father's occupation, aspiration, and education. Job history is also important to my analysis. All these factors influence class mobility, and may either increase or mask the action of each other in different circumstances. By looking at mobility I will demonstrate the way class relationships impinge on individual lives.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration and settlement in Indian, Korean and Chinese immigrant communities in Auckland: a perspective from the political ecology of health</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Anneka</field><field name="description">This research used tuberculosis (TB) as a lens to elucidate how migration, settlement, local agency and support networks influence migrants&#8217; health in New Zealand. The study also examined specific characteristics of TB such as delays in diagnosis and the stigma attached to the disease to gain a broader understanding of TB experience for migrants in New Zealand. The research addressed these aims through the analytical framework of political ecology and incorporation of interviews, participant observation and media analysis. Participants in the research included immigrants from Mainland China, South Korea, and India, and New Zealand health care professionals. The study found that immigration policies, social discrimination and isolation have created structural inequalities between dominant host populations and Asian migrants in New Zealand. These inequalities compounded settlement problems such as language difficulties and limited employment opportunities, resulting in low income levels and perceived stress for Indian, Korean and Chinese people, which has affected their health and well being. Transnational policies and experiences of health care systems in immigrants&#8217; countries of origin and in New Zealand strongly influenced health seeking behaviour of migrants, along with structural barriers such as lack of Asian health care professionals and interpreting services. Local cultural and biological factors including health cultures and physical symptoms also affected these practices. In relation to TB, structural processes along with clinic doctor-patient relationships and social stigmas created barriers to diagnosis and treatment. Factors that facilitated access to health care in general, and TB diagnosis and treatment in particular, included the use of support networks, particularly local General Practitioners from countries of origin, and Public Health Nurses, along with flexible TB treatment programmes. This study shows that the incidence and experience of TB is shaped by migration and settlement processes. It also builds upon other medical anthropological studies that have employed political ecology by demonstrating its usefulness in application to developed as well as developing countries. In addition, the study contributes to the growing area of Asian migration research in New Zealand, illustrating that migration and settlement processes are complex and need to be understood as multidimensional, thus demonstrating advantages in approaching them from a political ecological framework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigration, Migrant Health, Political Ecology, Tuberculosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and the Return to Empire: an Indigenous Response = Te torino whakahaere, whakamuri</field><field name="creator">Stewart-Harawira, Makere</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demonstrative clefts in spoken English</field><field name="creator">Calude, Andreea S.</field><field name="description">This research concerns the structural and discourse related properties of cleft constructions found in spoken New Zealand English. In particular, the main analysis focuses on one cleft type, namely on the demonstrative cleft; examples include (a) 'That's what I had in mind' and (b) 'That's what I thought'. The demonstrative cleft has received little attention in the literature, and this is reflected in its inconsistent classification (some believe it to be a reversed wh-cleft, others classify it together with it-clefts, and others still use the label &#8216;th-cleft&#8217;).  The current work investigates the clefts exemplified in (a) and (b), in terms of 23 different structural and discourse related properties. These properties were identified by consulting existing literature on clefts, and data from the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English (about 200,000 words of spontaneous conversation). Additionally, the same excerpts of conversation were also examined for it-clefts, wh-clefts and reversed wh-clefts, whose most significant properties in spoken language are also related here. The data were tagged manually for the various cleft constructions investigated, and difficult examples were cross-checked by and discussed with other linguists.  The thesis consists of three introductory chapters (Chapters 1, 2 and 3), which introduce the data investigated and the constructions analysed. Chapter 4 presents the analysis of the demonstrative cleft. Following this, peripheral and problematic demonstrative clefts, that is, clefts which deviate from the prototypical demonstrative cleft model are discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, Chapter 6 deals with other cleft types in English, namely it-clefts, wh-clefts and reversed wh-clefts, and their most significant properties in spoken language. The thesis concludes with a summary chapter (Chapter 7).  One innovative aspect of the research concerns the fact that in spoken language, clefts can be 'un-integrated' or loosely integrated inside the syntactic structure which they are part of, while still being tightly connected within the discourse portion in which they are found, e.g., 'That's what you have to do when moving into a new house is nest', and 'That is what the government wants you to do is to vote Labour' (termed here double cleft construction). Double clefts are discussed in Chapter 4. The corpus also contains un-integrated wh-clefts, such as 'What I want to do is I want to study clefts', treated in Chapter 5. Previous studies suggest that in spoken language, the distinction between the syntax of clauses and the overall organisation of discourse is not always clear; clauses which do not appear to be syntactically subordinate may nonetheless be subordinate in terms of the discourse role they play. This is problematic for existing syntactic theories which rely on tightly integrated structures. An adequate analysis of un-integrated constructions, in terms of their syntax and discourse function will be of interest both to theoretical syntax and to computational linguistics.  The research contributes to existing knowledge of the grammatical constructions used by speakers of New Zealand English and English worldwide. Given the significant differences between the grammar of spoken language and that of written language, this work helps increase understanding of spoken language and of what it means to be a &#8216;speaker&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spoken grammar</field><field name="subject">clefts</field><field name="subject">cognitive gramar</field><field name="subject">syntactic un-integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanistic Studies of HF Adsorption on Alumina</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Alistair Ross</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching and learning with technology as enabler: a case study on flexible learning for postgraduate nurses</field><field name="creator">Honey, Michelle Lorraine Lewis</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the practice of flexible learning for postgraduate nurses.  Flexible learning is a contemporary approach to learning that utilises the benefits of technology.  Flexible learning can be understood as a continuum, from fully on-line or web-based courses, to those that are on-campus and supported by technology.  Internationally, the rise of flexible learning has been influenced by increased demand for higher education and competition among providers within the context of reduced education funding.  The study population, New Zealand postgraduate nurses are accessing higher education in increasing numbers to advance their practice and to position themselves for new roles and opportunities.  These are often experienced nurses yet inexperienced in higher university education, who combine study, work and other commitments.  The study employed a qualitative case study design because it enabled multiple perspectives to be gained.  Data included documentation, participant observation, survey, students&#8217; assessed work and interviews with key stakeholders: student, teacher and the organisation.  Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously as an iterative process.  Thematic analysis was conducted on reviewed documentation, participant observation and interviews.  The survey was analysed using descriptive statistical analysis techniques.  Finally, a rubric was constructed as a matrix for analysing assessed work.  The study identifies the elements that contribute to flexible learning and the interconnectedness between the elements within the dynamic context of a university to illustrate that effective flexible learning can be provided by using a student centred approach to ensure the learning needs of postgraduate nurses are met.  Flexible learning was found to improve access, choice, and provide an emphasis on the student as central to learning.  In response to these findings the weighting of recommendations are toward the organisation as it is at this level where greater change can be made to improve support for flexible learning provision.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing education</field><field name="subject">flexible learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brands we love to hate: An exploration of brand avoidance</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael Shyue Wai</field><field name="description">Brands, and the process of branding, are of considerable importance in both marketing academia and practice. Although most research has focussed on the positive attitudes and behaviours that consumers have toward brands, there is a growing interest in anti-consumption. This thesis contributes to anti-consumption research by exploring the phenomenon of brand avoidance. Earlier studies investigating the avoidance of brands have been one-dimensional, failing to account for the wide range of reasons underlying brand avoidance. Therefore, this thesis addresses the limitations of existing models by providing an integrative and comprehensive approach to understanding brand avoidance. As an anti-consumption phenomenon, brand avoidance concerns the negative interaction between consumers, as social actors, and brands, as meaningful objects, within a social and historical context. Therefore, this thesis adopts an interpretive approach, a social constructionist epistemology, and historical realist ontology. Since research in the immediate area of brand avoidance is limited, this thesis employs a grounded theory methodology to analyse, code, and generate theory from the qualitative data gathered through 23 in-depth interviews. Four main types of brand avoidance (experiential, identity, deficit-value, and moral) and the circumstances in which brand avoidance may be restricted or alleviated (avoidance antidotes) emerge from the data. Existing literatures are used to further inform these findings and an original negative brand promises framework is developed to help increase understanding of the brand avoidance phenomenon. The main components of this research are then integrated into an emergent theoretical model of brand avoidance. This model offers a synopsis of how the various brand avoidance constructs may relate to one another and to other pertinent branding concepts within a consumption system. Combined, the findings of this thesis provide a comprehensive appreciation of why consumers avoid certain brands in addition to potential insights that may be used in the management of brand avoidance. Overall, this thesis contributes knowledge to the growing field of anti-consumption research by providing an innovative overview and an integrative understanding of an under-explored domain, brand avoidance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand avoidance</field><field name="subject">Anti-consumption</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Consumer resistance</field><field name="subject">Disatisfaction</field><field name="subject">Undesired self</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uttar Pradesh - lagging state of India: economic development and role of banks</field><field name="creator">Arora, Rashmi Umesh</field><field name="description">The present study challenges the negative and static stance of the recent literature on Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, and espouses a balanced and moderate approach. The existing literature focuses only on human development and ignores the underlying social, political and economic changes taking place in the state. It ignores the decline in credit to the state. The present study synthesises and amalgamates various streams of literature on the state to fill the gap. It uses bank credit and its role in UP&#8217;s economic development as a tool to explore the changes and structural and regional shifts in the state. It examines bank credit to various regions, districts, occupations, rural and urban populations, large and small borrowers and gender in UP. This study explores credit in a multi-dimensional framework as a route to growth, development, inequality, globalisation, urbanisation, and empowerment. The study further explores the relationship between bank credit and the state&#8217;s human development. As a critique of the existing literature, the study examines whether UP is really lagging behind other states of India. Through a twin indicator approach, broadly grouped into income and non-income, the study shows that the state does lag on income front. The non-income indicators analysis, however, shows that a number of other states including high-income states are lagging. The study eschews the watertight categorisation of east and west UP as pursued in the existing literature, and adopts a broader regional classification. This showed that, although gradual, change has occurred in UP. The overall findings of the study suggest that structural and non-structural constraints characterise the development of the state. The multiple roles of credit have generated growth, helped in poverty reduction, but also influenced regional inequality and rural-urban inequalities, and widened the gap between small and large borrowers in the state. The empowerment of women through credit from commercial banks remains a distant goal as women receive less than 20 per cent of the total credit. Another significant finding of the study is that the income and non-income factors are strongly correlated, for instance, the strong negative relationship between income and the Human Poverty Index. The study, therefore, underlines the need for increased economic growth to achieve better economic and human development outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uttar Pradesh, India, Development, Economic Growth, Bank credit, Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding the frontiers: logistical limitations of Roman imperialism in the West</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Christopher Felstead</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the importance of army supply in deciding the success and failure of the frontiers of the Roman Empire with particular emphasis on those frontiers in the Rhine-Danube provinces. It will look at logistics as the reason for the end of expansion of the Roman Empire and the frontiers forming where they did. It will also argue that the failure of logistics was a major factor in the collapse of those same frontier defences and the ultimate fall of the western part of the empire. The need to feed and supply large numbers of troops and their dependents dictated where they could be based. Because of the impossibility of supplying the whole army with imported goods, the suitability of local land for food production was also paramount. The need to have reliable sources of supply locally was met by placing veterans on retirement in villae rusticae in frontier zones. This had the effect of controlling those local sources of supply and also satisfying the increasingly expensive needs of the army praemia militiae. The increased warfare and periodic invasions from the reign of Marcus Aurelius especially on the upper Rhine and upper Danube made supply more difficult. The army placed an increasing number of beneficiarii consularis on important points on the transport network to control and direct the flow of army supplies. The more frequent invasions across the frontiers from the third century caused greater dislocation to the agricultural infrastructure not only on the frontiers but deeper into the more settled and richer provinces. This destroyed the sources of local supply and also often the source of imported supply, forcing Roman armies to stay well inside the imperial boundaries more often than before. The loss of their logistic superiority spelt the loss of their military advantage, and the loss of empire.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430112 History: Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the artwork-world: perichoretic rehearsals of the divine encounter</field><field name="creator">Jack, Matthew, 1963-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological Indicators of Faecal Contamination in Aquatic Environments</field><field name="creator">Turner, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">1. The aim of this research was to determine appropriate microbial indicator systems for use in monitoring the occurrence and source of faecal contamination in aquatic environments. Particular emphasis has been placed on the identification of indicators which might enable faecal contamination of human origin to be distinguished from that of non-human derivation. Two lines of investigation have been pursued; the use of alternative microbial indicator systems for water quality monitoring, and the development of diagnostic molecular methods for identifying the origin of faecal organisms. 2. Field and treatment plant studies were undertaken to investigate the utility of three indicator systems for monitoring water quality impacts in the coastal area surrounding the discharge from Auckland's North Shore City wastewater treatment plant. F-specific bacteriophage (F-phage) and ratios of F-phage to enterococci and faecal coliforms were examined over a twelve month period in which indicator levels at various stages of the wastewater treatment process were measured. These indicators and levels of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediment were measured in four outfall impact studies. 3. F-phage levels in effluent from the treatment plant (median=2.5 x 102 cfu/l00 ml) were too low to enable their use as source-specific tracers of effluent dispersion. However, higher F-phage levels in raw sewage (median=6.2 x l05 cfu/l00 ml) suggested that phage may be an appropriate indicator of raw sewage contamination in the receiving environment. F-phage was detected in coastal waters remote from the sewage outfall, providing presumptive evidence of sewage contamination entering the sea from sources other than the outfall discharge itself. 4. F-phage/enterococci and F-phage/faecal coliform ratios that were determined for sewage and treated effluent derived from the North Shore plant proved to be highly variable and were therefore unreliable for determining the source faecal contamination. 5. The concentration of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediments did not provide a useful means for tracing the distribution of faecal contaminants in the coastal system because the spore levels were found to be similar throughout the study area. This widespread occurrence of C. perfringens spores prevented identification of defined impact zones for any of the potential sources of faecal contaminants examined. 6. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to investigate whether genetic markers could be identified for Escherichia coli isolates derived from different sources. RAPD profiling was found to be a highly discriminative method able to subtype E. coli strains present in both sewage and in the wastewater stream of a mechanical wood-pulping operation. In the pulp mill effluent, RAPD analysis indicated the presence of a restricted range of E. coli strains compared to the range found in the water intake and sewage effluent discharges. The results obtained provide presumptive evidence for the multiplication of E. coli strains within the wastewater stream. 7. Comparison of RAPD profiles derived from a range of human and environmental E. coli isolates led to the identification of a 1.6-kb marker. present in a subset of human isolates, but found only infrequently in isolates from animal origin. Primers based on sequence information obtained from this region of the genome yielded a direct PCR assay for the 'human' marker. The reliability and utility of the assay was improved when fluorescently-labelled primers and an automated DNA detection system was employed for the analysis of the amplified PCR products. 8. The diagnostic polymorphism was localised to the region immediately downstream of the gene encoding the glycine decarboxylase P-protein (gcvP). Comparison of DNA sequences from this region in 'marker-positive' and 'marker-negative' E. coli isolates revealed an abrupt loss of homology immediately downstream of the transcription termination point of the gcvP gene. The region of non-homology extends for at least 130 base pairs beyond the gcvP transcription terminator. Sequences spanning this region in marker-negative isolates exhibited a high level homology with that determined for E. coli K-12. The origin of the sequence for the same region in marker-positive isolates was unable to be identified. 9. The utility of the marker for environmental monitoring was investigated in a field study of a rural stream receiving bacterial contamination of both human and animal origin. The marker was consistently detected both in isolates derived from sewage effluents and in those found immediately downstream from sewage inputs-despite the presence of a high background of E. coli of animal origin. However the utility of the marker as a sewage-specific tracer was limited by the relatively low numbers of marker-positive d. coli in sewage effluents (approximately 8%). 10. In summary, the work described in this thesis has confirmed the need for multiple indicator systems in water quality monitoring and has identified appropriate areas for further research. The most promising area for future research is in the development of molecular tools which might provide both a better understanding of genetic variation in indicator organisms and enable methods to be developed for the detection of host-specific strains. Location of other polymorphisms likely to be present in the E. coli genome should enable further host-specific markers to be identified which could complement the 'human' marker identified in this study.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological studies on turnip yellow mosaic virus in Brassica pekinensis</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Lena</field><field name="description">1. When purified turnip ye1low mosaic virus was inoculated mechanically on to Chinese cabbage leaves, using known numbers of virus particles in 0.1 to 1.0 &#181;1 volumes of inoculum, as few as 10 to 30 particles were required to produce a single local lesion.2. Inoculation of a cotyledon leaf of Chinese cabbage seedlings with turnip yellow mosaic virus produced a rapid transient inhibition in the rate of leaf initiation, so that infected plants developed 0.5 to 1.0 leaf less than healthy plants. 3. The factor that initiated the inhibitory response a t the apical. meristem began moving out of the inoculated cotyledon within 1to 6 hours after inoculation, thus preceding the movement out of the inoculated cotyledon of infectious virus or RNA which was not detectable until about day 5. 4. The transient inhibition of leaf initiation occurred following inoculation with any one of three unrelated viruses, or with infectious turnip ye1low mosaic virus RNA. 5. A factor eluted in an active form from the cut petioles of inoculated 1eaves. 6. It is necessary to inoculate with infectious virus or RNA to initiate the production of the inhibitory factor. 7. No differences were seen in the magnitude or timing of the reduced rate of 1eaf initiation, when the concentration of turnip yellow mosaic virus in the inoculum was varied between 1 &#181; g/ml and 100 &#181;g/ml. 8. Inoculation of the cotyledons of Chinese cabbage seed1ings with turnip ye1low mosaic virus caused a marked disturbance in the mitotic index a t the apical meristem between 6 and 48 hours. 9. A reduction in the accumulation of starch in the chloroplasts of cell s in the apical meristem occurred at 6 t o 24 hours after inoculation of the cotyledon 1eaf. 10. Abscisic acid applied to the cotyledon in a single 20 &#181;1 dose, elicited a response that closely paralleled the events that took place when Chinese cabbage seedlings were inoculated with turnip yellow mosaic virus. A decrease in the rate of leaf initiation began 1 t o 2 days after application and the inhibition of leaf initiation was preceded by a disturbance in the mitotic index in the apical meristem. 11. Gibberellic acid applied with the eluate from virus-inoculated leaves, was able to overcome the inhibition of leaf initiation. 12. The leaf inhibition assay in Chinese cabbage seedlings is a sensitive bioassay for abscisic acid. The minimum detectable concentration of 3 x M is comparable to those reported for the Commelina stomata1 closure bioassay which could detect 10 -10 abscisic acid (Ogunkanmi et a1 . 1973).</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of calpain 3 transcripts in mammalian cells : expression of alternatively-spliced variants in non-muscle cell types</field><field name="creator">Dickson, James Michael Jeremy</field><field name="description">An investigation of the expression profile of mRNA encoding Calpain 3, the causative agent in the inherited human muscular disease Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A, was conducted in two representative mammalian species, human and mouse.  Transcripts encoding Calpain 3 were identified from mammalian tissues other than skeletal muscle.  In human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) these transcripts were identified in both the T-cell and B-cell compartments and in a number of human blood cell lines representing different haematopoietic lineages.  Calpain 3 transcripts encoding the murine homologue were also described from mouse PBMCs and from murine tissues involved in haematopoiesis.  In addition to the confirmation of Calpain 3 expression in non-skeletal muscle tissues in both these species, transcripts were identified with precise and defined deletions, which mapped to known exon-exon boundaries in the Calpain 3 gene from both species.  These deletions constituted the removal by alternative splicing of skeletal muscle-specific components of the Calpain 3 protein known to regulate its function in this tissue.  Monoclonal antibodies to the Calpain 3 protein were used to confirm the presence of Calpain 3 protein in non-skeletal muscle tissues of both human and mouse.  In humans the expression of Calpain 3 protein was confirmed in PBMCs and in the mouse, Calpain 3 expression was confirmed in tissues of the haematopoietic compartment.  In both species the Calpain 3 protein expressed correlated with translation from a transcript lacking the skeletal muscle-specific components generated by alternative splicing.  An attempt was made using a Yeast Two Hybrid assay to identify potential regulatory molecules of Calpain 3 in human PBMCs, but without a definitive candidate molecule being found.  A developmental model of muscle differentiation (murine C2C12 myoblast cells) was used to ascertain the expression profile of Calpain 3 in the early stages of myofibrillogenesis.  Using Quantitative Real Time PCR the expression profile of Calpain 3 was assessed in differentiating C2C12 cells.  These results showed that the absolute levels of Calpain 3 transcription were elevated during differentiation and that a temporal Calpain 3 isoform shift occurred during this process.  This temporal shift in expression was from transcripts having identical deletions to those seen in the haematopoietic tissues, to full length transcripts representative of skeletal muscle-specific Calpain 3. The identification of Calpain 3 expression outside skeletal muscle tissue is novel and the isoforms expressed in these tissues are structurally more analogous to the ubiquitously expressed calpains.  This has implications for LGMD2A where a loss of function of Calpain 3 in non-skeletal muscle tissue could be compensated for by the ubiquitous calpains, thus explaining the lack of any non-muscle tissue pathology in LGMD2A patients.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mammalian, Calpain 3, Alternative-splicing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of the novel mouFSnrp gene and the characterisation of its in situ expression profile during mouse neurogenesis</field><field name="creator">Bradoo, Privahini</field><field name="description">Recently, a novel protein family, named as neural regeneration peptides (NRPs), was predicted across the rat, human and mouse genomes by one of my supervisors, Dr. Sieg. Synthetic forms of these proteins have been previously shown to act as potent neuronal chemoattractants and have a major role in neural regeneration. In light of these properties, these peptides are key candidates for drug development against an array of neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this PhD project was to provide confirmation of the existence of a member of the NRP coding gene family, annotated in the mouse genome. This gene, called mouse frameshift nrp (mouFSnrp), was hypothesised exist as a -1bp frameshift to another predicted gene AlkB. This project involved the identification of the mouFSnrp gene, and the characterisation of its expression pattern and ontogeny during mouse neural development. Through the work described in this thesis, the mouFSnrp gene was identified in mouse embryonic cortical cultures and its protein coding gene sequence was verified. mouFSnrp expression was shown to be present in neural as well as non-neural tissues, via RT-PCR. Using non-radioactive in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical colocalisation studies, interesting insights into the lineage and ontogeny of mouFSnrp expression during brain development were revealed. These results indicate that mouFSnrp expression originates in neural stem cells of the developing cortex, and appears to be preferentially continued via the radial glial lineage. mouFSnrp expression is carried forward via the neurogenic radial glia into their daughter neuronal progeny as well as postnatal astrocyte. In the postnatal brain, mouFSnrp gene transcripts were also observed in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus, both of which are known to have high neurogenic potential. In general, the radial glial related nature of mouFSnrp expression appears to be a hallmark of the mouFSnrp expression pattern through out neural development.  This thesis provides the first confirmation of the existence of a completely novel gene, mouFSnrp, and its putative -1 translational frameshifting structure. Further, preliminary data presented in this thesis regarding the mouFSnrp in situ expression pattern during mouse brain development may suggest a key role of the gene in neuronal migration and neurogenesis in mice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural regeneration</field><field name="subject">Neuronal migration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of trends and reasons for rising acute medical admissions in Auckland's public hospitals</field><field name="creator">Benipal, Jagpal Singh</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study was to examine empirically the trends and reasons for rising acute adult medical admissions at two major public hospitals in Auckland from 1997 to 2004. According to recent national and international literature published on the topic, there has been unsustainable growth in the adult medical admissions both in NZ and most of the other developed countries. Overall, the causes of this increase have not been explored sufficiently in the literature reviewed. The NZ research has largely focused on the macro-analysis of hospital throughput data from health policy points of view. Methodology: A mixed methodology research design was applied to address the problem. Phase 1 quantitatively analysed adult medical hospital admission data (N = 277,416) obtained from the two hospitals (Middlemore and Auckland Public Hospitals), and phase 2 qualitatively explored the responses and views of the health professional expert panel (n = 16) in relation to the findings of phase 1 of the study. Findings: Overall, the crude number of admissions and age-standardised admission rates at both hospitals increased more rapidly than actual population increases. Approximately 1/3 of the patients accounted for 2/3 of the total admissions. Five major diagnostic categories accounted for 70%-80% of total acute admissions, with circulatory and respiratory system disorders being the leading causes of medical admissions. There was a strong relationship between age and increased admissions. MMH hospital overall, and its ethnic groups separately, had significantly higher admission rates than APH. Comparison of ethnic groups highlighted significant variations in the admission rates at the two hospitals despite adjusting for age, morbidity and deprivation. Conclusions: Overall the increase and variation in admission rates between the hospitals and ethnic groups was dependent on factors such as the characteristics of the population and patients, hospital admission and administration processes, availability of hospital beds, medical management at the hospital, and availability of primary and community care services. By making changes to those factors in the control of hospitals and District Health Boards, hospitals can potentially influence the trajectory of rising medical admissions. These factors include systems for managing patients with chronic illness, and pathways from community services to hospital. Finally, a number of future research areas, such as a large-scale study to explore the health service utilisation of the 55+ age groups, have been proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The indigenous factor: exploring kapa haka as a culturally responsive learning environment in mainstream secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Whitinui, Paul</field><field name="description">Recent research focusing on improving educational outcomes for M&#257;ori students in mainstream secondary schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand have asserted that building positive student-teacher relationships in the classroom are fundamental (c. f. Bishop, Berryman, &amp; Richardson, 2003; Bishop &amp; Tiakiwai, 2003; Ministry of Education, 2002, 2006). In contrast, attempts to investigate the educational benefits associated with M&#257;ori students participating in cultural learning activities, such as kapa haka, and the implications for improving levels of M&#257;ori student achievement, remains relatively unexplored. To embark on such an investigation, M&#257;ori kapa haka students and teachers from four mainstream secondary schools were invited to take part in an interview process informed by using a Kaupapa M&#257;ori theoretical approach. As a result, the study revealed quite emphatically that not only does kapa haka provide M&#257;ori students with an appropriate &#8216;culturally responsive&#8217; learning experience, but that they also feel more confident and optimistic about school and their education. Moreover, kapa haka provides the opportunity for students to celebrate who they are as M&#257;ori and as &#8216;culturally connected&#8217; learners in mainstream schooling contexts. In addition, M&#257;ori students through the kapa haka experience learn to &#8216;protect&#8217;, &#8216;problem-solve&#8217;, &#8216;provide&#8217;, and &#8216;heal&#8217; their inner self-worth, essence and wellbeing as M&#257;ori. Similarly, most teachers agreed that kapa haka provides M&#257;ori students with a creative, dynamic and powerful way to access their learning potential as cultural human beings. An overwhelming response by both students and teachers is that kapa haka should be timetabled as an academic subject to provide greater access to indigenous and cultural performing art that affirms their identity as M&#257;ori, and our uniqueness as New Zealanders. Finally, the research proposes a &#8216;culturally responsive&#8217; learning strategy to assist what mainstream secondary schools and teachers provide as valid and purposeful learning opportunities for &#8216;culturally connected&#8217; learners who are M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing to the music of your heart: home schooling the school-resistant child. A constructivist account of school refusal</field><field name="creator">Stroobant, Emma</field><field name="description">School resistance is usually understood as a pathological behaviour or condition indicative of underlying mental disorder for which therapy is &#8216;indicated&#8217; and home schooling is &#8216;contraindicated&#8217;. However, I argue that the psychiatric/psychological classifications commonly used to identify school resistance (i.e. &#8216;school phobia&#8217; and &#8216;school refusal&#8217;) are socio-historical constructs that function to socially and discursively position school-resistant children as &#8216;abnormal&#8217;, &#8216;irrational&#8217;, &#8216;dysfunctional&#8217; and &#8216;sick&#8217; individuals whose problems are likely to be compounded by school withdrawal. Assuming that school resistance and home schooling can be constructed in multiple and competing ways, I explore the perspectives of seven school-resistant children who are being (or have been) home schooled, their mothers, and nine practitioners working with children. I argue that by applying a different set of assumptions to school resistance, the meaning of this phenomenon can be radically transformed and so too can the experiences of school resisters and their families. This research suggests that for some mothers and their school-resistant children, home schooling can provide an acceptable and effective solution to the problems raised by school resistance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orphans of the imagination: exploring boundaries of culture/class in New Zealand education</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Melissa</field><field name="description">At different moments in New Zealand&#8217;s social history anxiety about particular groups of boys has been a focal point of public and official discourses about the state of the society, and education&#8217;s function within it. These moments, in common, are dominated by prevailing perceptions of moral and normative breakdown; of social crises in one form or another. Recent concerns about the so-called problem of boys&#8217; educational underachievement have been no exception. What has shifted over time is the discursive construction of problem boys; from their unequivocal characterisation as &#8216;villains&#8217; in the society to their constitution as &#8216;victims&#8217; of it. In this thesis I utilise a critical analysis of state, public and educational discourses about &#8216;problem&#8217; boys at different historical junctures as a lens to examine continuity and change in the configuration of the state/society relation in New Zealand, and education&#8217;s pivotal role within it. I argue that the discursive production of meanings about education occurs within the wider society and tends to be dominated by fractions of the middle class. The institutionalisation of particular dominant discourses about schooling, however, is mediated by the state formation specific to each moment. Through education, and in other ways, the state has a significant role in the regulation, constitution and re-shaping of individual and collective identities. I maintain that while internal and external socio-economic and political transformation over time has wrought inevitable changes in state form and techniques of governmentality, there are discernable continuities between the liberal/paternal state and its predecessors. Education remains both as a nexus of the state/society relation and as a key site of discursive struggles within and between them. I suggest that the current critical literature on boys and schooling is constrained by its own gender frame of reference. It cannot account for the multidimensional, historically embedded, contextually specific and socially produced understandings about education, gender, class and ethnicity that powerfully inflect contemporary and historical concerns about different groups of boys in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Georges Bernanos, d&#233;molisseur d'impostures</field><field name="creator">Carlyle, Diane P.

In the second part Bernanos is placed within the context of his times and compared to other intellectuals, both Catholic and non-Catholic, in order to separate the "Catholic" from the "non-Catholic" elements in his work. Next, using the methods of Charles Mauron, we study the Youthful Works. In the third part, following the methods of Lucien Goldmann, we place the Novels in the context of Ecclesiastical Politics. In the fourth part we trace the transformation of the Novelist into the political pundit, then we go back to La Grande peur des bien-pensants to retrace the origins of his political thinking. Chapter twelve, "Birth of the Modem World", traces the development of capitalism in France and concomitant evolution of the value-system and ways of thinking. The fifth part contains the second half of the "Ecrits de Combat" entitled "The Modem World" which gives us Bernanos's view - a prophetic view - of the world we inhabit at present, Then the Conclusion.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420209 French</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the metabolic control of cytosolic and lysosomal glycogen levels in the liver</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Jacqueline Ann</field><field name="description">Although glycogen is a chemically homogeneous material it is polydisperse, exhibiting a broad molecular weight spectrum and a metabolic lability that is molecular weight dependent. The lower molecular weight (&#946;-particle) glycogen was found to be extremely labile, while the higher molecular weight (&#945;-particle) exhibited a far lower metabolic activity, indicating that it may act as a glycogen store for mobilisation in stress situations. These observations, coupled to the existence of Pompe&#8217;s Disease, a glycogen storage disease involving the lysosomal system, supports the hypothesis that &#945; - and &#946; -particulate glycogen may be partially separated from one another within the cell i.e. compartmentalised. By the use of a rapid differential centrifugation technique it was possible to show, both physiochemically and ultrastructurally, the existence of glycogen of a very large molecular size associated with the lysosomal fraction. This glycogen exhibited a different molecular weight distribution from that isolate from the liver as a whole i.e. cytosol + lysosomal. It is suggested that appreciably more than 10% of cellular glycogen is located within the lysosomes and that this is of predominantly high molecular weight. The size-distribution of liver glycogen was shown to be distinctly affected by the anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylate and Indomethacin. By measurement of the incorporation of radioactive glucose into glycogen, salicylate was shown to have a depressing effect on overall liver glycogen metabolism. These effects appear to arise from a stabilisation of the lysosomal membrane by the drugs. The incorporation, via liposomes, of purified anti-1,4-&#945;-glucosidase antibodies into the liver lysosomes of normal Wistar rats and rats with a genetic deficiency of phosphorylase kinase, caused a distinct decrease in 1,4-&#945;-glucosidase activity and in the content of high molecular weight glycogen. These changes were enhanced by prolonged liposomal-antibody treatment and suggested that a possible feedback control mechanism operates in the incorporation of glycogen into lysosomes. The 1-4- &#945; -glucosidase inhibitor, Acarbose, when injected intraperitoneally into normal and phosphorylase kinase-deficient rats similarly disturbed liver lysosomal metabolism, causing distinct and persistent inhibition of enzymes and acute disturbances of lysosomal glycogen metabolism. Again a feedback control mechanism appears to operate, which effects cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism. The biochemical effects closely resembled those occurring in Pompe&#8217;s disease and were confirmed by electron microscopy. A model for the adult form of the lysosomal storage disease has been suggested.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Puna : the archaeology and history of a New Zealand Mission Station, 1832-1874</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the archaeology and history of Te Puna, a Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission station in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. Te Puna was first settled in 1832 following the closure of the nearby Oihi mission, which had been the first mission station and the first permanent European settlement in New Zealand. Te Puna, located alongside the imposing Rangihoua Pa, was the home of missionaries John and Hannah King and their children for some forty years. As well as being a mission station, Te Puna was also the site of the family&#8217;s subsistence farm. The research is concerned with the archaeological landscape of Te Puna, the relationship between Maori and European, the early organisation and economy of the CMS, the material culture of New Zealand&#8217;s first European settlers, and the beginnings of colonisation and the part that the missions played in this. Artefacts recovered from archaeological investigations at the site of the Te Puna mission house are connected with other items of missionary material culture held in collections in the Bay of Islands, including objects donated by the King family. The archaeological record is also integrated with documentary evidence, in particular the accounts of the CMS store, to produce a detailed picture of the daily life and economy of the Te Puna mission household. This integration of a range of sources is also extended to produce a broader view of the material culture and economy of missionary life in the Bay of Islands in the first half of the nineteenth century. The humble, austere artefacts that constitute the material culture of the Te Puna household reveal the actual processes of colonisation in daily life and everyday events, as well as the processes of the mission, such as schooling, the purchase of food and domestic labour, the purchase of land and building of houses, the stitching of fabric and ironing of garments. These practices predate, but also anticipate the grand historical dramas such as the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, glorified but also critiqued as the defining moment of the relationship between Maori and Pakeha and of colonisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Par erruer: error analysis and the early stages of adolescent foreign language learning</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Roger</field><field name="description">Error Analysis has been widely used in studies of second language learning. At the same time, foreign language learning (as opposed to teaching), has largely been ignored as an object of research. The research had three major aims: to examine the potential of Error Analysis in foreign language learning by the development and trialling of a complex new coding schedule for analysing learner errors in French; to provide some descriptive data on the written errors and performance of foreign language pupils over a complete scholastic year; and to explore the nature of foreign language learning strategies used by the pupils studied. The thesis opens with a statement of purpose and method. This is followed by a short discussion of theories, topics and techniques in second and foreign language learning. The development of two forms of the coding schedule used to analyse errors is described and discussed. Recode checks and the development of 'Coding Confidence Levels' are presented. Procedures used in a longitudinal study of errors are then described. This study acted as an important trial for the coding schedules, known as Foreign Language Error Analysis: French (FLEAF). All written French produced by eight pupils in the same school class was collected over the 1978 New Zealand school year (February to December). The group were in their second year of high school French and had an average age of 14 years 5 months midway through the study. Background information is given about the subjects, including results of selected IEA French (Population II) tests administered during the year. Some description of the year's work is given, followed by general and case study analyses of errors. Selected results from both the longer (FLEAF-L) and shorter (FLEAF-S) coding schedules are then tabulated and discussed. Particular attention is paid to variables coding possible explanations for errors. Detailed analyses of errors in word order, negation and gender are offered, along with a review of correct performances for selected aspects. These analyses lead to two preliminary hypotheses which could in part explain the occurrence of errors. One hypothesis relates to the frequency with which pupils had been required to focus through drills on the point at issue, the other to the number of choices available to the pupil at the time of error. Discussion of Error Analysis and pupil strategies is then presented. It is concluded that Error Analysis has a valid role in developing hypotheses for a theory of foreign language learning. Five such hypotheses, suggested by the longitudinal study, are presented. It is argued that these five could all be classified on one of a proposed five levels of 'Operating Procedures' (McLaughlin, 1978a). Selection of a unique cluster of operating procedures would constitute the learning/performance 'strategy' of a particular pupil. These notions are incorporated into a tentative framework for a theory of foreign language learning. A modified 'Principle of Least Effort' (Zipf, 1965), is suggested as a key factor in the early stages of learning a foreign language, and ideas for subsequent research are proposed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Error and self-correction in reading and oral language</field><field name="creator">Ng, Seok Moi</field><field name="description">The aim of this one year descriptive longitudinal study was to investigate the efficient strategies some competent novice readers used while learning to read in an existing reading programme for which text reading was the main instructional task. The prior teaching of sounds or of words in isolation or in lists was not emphasized in this programme. The authors of the texts tried to use the language of New Zealand Children. These texts provide the support for the Auckland child who comes to the new task of reading with a set of responses learnt from his past experience with oral language. Other important questions of the study related to whether children in such a programme could read not only unseen classroom texts, but also texts from a programme with a decoding emphasis. Fifty-two competent readers were chosen by a stratified random sampling method from 242 six-year-old children attending 20 randomly selected schools in Auckland. Strategy usage in oral reading was related to 3 factors: learning opportunities over time, (at 6:0, 6:6 and 7:0); reader proficiency, (Average, High Average, Good and Excellent); and text difficulty, (Easy, Moderately Difficult, Difficult and Phonically Regular). The children&#8217;s performances on oral reading and an oral sentence repetition test at 6:0 and 7:0 were compared. The data comprising errors and self corrections were analyzed at three linguistic levels (graphemic/phonemic, syntactic and semantic), to infer strategies. The Friedman two-way analysis of variance test for related samples was used for most comparisons. Th level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The findings suggest that the Auckland child used the facilitating effects of meaning and structure in both reading and sentence repetition tasks. The control which children gained from 6:0 to 7:0 over texts with the decoding emphasis was achieved by attention to both graphemic cues and cues from structure and meaning. The competent novice reader also showed flexibility in selecting different strategies to deal with easy, familiar texts and difficult or novel texts. Such strategies are a necessary part of a model of mature reading which dies not see reading as exclusively the use of anticipatory mechanisms nor solely the use of sequential letter-by-letter processing. The competent novice reader was apparently learning to use either, or combinations, of these processes. The results of the study highlight the complex nature of learning to read and suggest that while some teaching programmes that emphasize a particular learning strategy may be successful, they may not take full advantage of other equally valid strategies which children can develop.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene sequencing and in vitro synthesis of the rotavirus non-structural glycoprotein</field><field name="creator">Powell, Kevin F. H. (Kevin Frederick Herbert)</field><field name="description">1. Recombinant DNA techniques have been applied to the dsRNA genome of the bovine rotavirus Nebraska Calf Scours Diarrhoea virus (NCDV). The sequence of a full - length cloned copy of genomic segment 10 of NCDV has been determined using the Sanger dideoxynucleoside sequencing technique by subcloning cDNA into M13 vectors. 2. Genomic segment 10 codes for the non-structural protein NCVP5, a protein which appears to be involved in virus maturation (Estes et al., 1983). Determination of the nucleic acid sequence of the gene has enabled the amino acid sequence o f the bovine NCVPS protein to be inferred. Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence with homologous sequences derived from other virus strains (Both et al., 1983c; Baybutt and McCrae, 1984; Okada et al., 1984; Ward et al., 1985) has enabled conserved regions of the molecule to be identified. A small region of the NCVPS protein has been identified (residues 131-161) which exhibits considerable variability between rotavirus strains. 3. A computer-based algorithm has been utilised to predict the folding pattern of NCDV gene 10 mRNA. This reveals a 'panhandle ' structure which differs from that proposed for the related gene of strain Wa rotavirus (Okada et al., 1984) but both molecules possess a common feature in that the initiation codon falls within a potentially-stable duplex formed with a portion of the 3 untranslated region. 4. A series of four site-directed deletion mutants of the cloned gene were constructed in order to investigate the functional significance of the three N-terminal hydrophobic regions of the NCVP5 protein. Two mutants were constructed using conveniently-located HindIII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The other two mutants were generated using M13 vectors and synthetic oligonucleotides. These modifications yielded genes coding for proteins in which portions of the first and second hydrophobic regions had been deleted. 5. DNA corresponding to the 'wild-type' coding region was inserted into an SP6 transcription vector to enable mRNA to be produced in vitro. This mRNA, when incubated in a reticulocyte lysate, directed the synthesis of a protein of the correct size (20 K). The addition of dog pancreatic microsomes to the reaction yielded a protein product (29 K) of a size consistent with the glycosylated ('wild-type') form of the NCVP5 protein. 6. The four variant forms of the NCVP5 gene were also inserted into SP6 transcription vectors and the protein products synthesised by the resulting mRNAs studied. All four mRNAs directed synthesis of variant protein products of the anticipated size. 7. The ability of the four variant proteins to become glycosylated and to associate with membranes was investigated. The topology of the proteins in the membrane was examined by digestion with proteolytic enzymes. Variant proteins altered in the first or second hydrophobic regions retained their ability to associate with membranes, suggesting that the third hydrophobic region, which was not altered, might play a role in membrane association. 8. A model for the disposition of NCVPS in the endoplasmic reticulum is proposed in which the first hydrophobic region is located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the second hydrophobic region spans the membrane and the third hydrophobic sequence associates independently with the membrane from the cytoplasmic side leaving the C-terminus of the molecule exposed to the cytoplasm. The model proposed accounts for the experimental observations but is in conflict with current mechanisms proposed for the insertion of proteins into membranes.

A wide variety of bonding modes have been discovered ranging from simple &#963;- through to more complex &#960;- and &#956;-interactions. This thesis deals with the synthesis and chemistry of just three classes of compound, those containing formal TM-C single, double and triple bonds. These species are normally referred to as transition metal alkyl (&#963;-aryl), carbene and carbyne complexes respectively. The material is divided into five chapters and each is introduced by a relevant review. In chapter 1 the syntheses of &#963;-alkyl and -aryl complexes of ruthenium and osmium are described. These species are produced from organomercury reagents either by oxidative addition to the zerovalent complex Ru(CO)&#8322;(PPh&#8323;) &#8323; or by reaction with the hydrido complexes MClH(CO)(PPh&#8323;) &#8323; (M = Ru, Os). This latter reaction provides a new route to organotransition metal complexes and some possible mechanisms are discussed. The organo-complexes formed by this latter method are coordinatively unsaturated and the structure of RuCl(p-tolyl)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; has been obtained by X-ray crystallography. The migratory insertion and reductive elimination reactions of these new compounds are discussed in chapters 2 and 3. Predictably, the Lewis base CO rapidly adds to these 16 electron species and the expected octahedral derivatives are formed. In some cases these are in equilibrium in solution with the corresponding dihapto-acyl complexes. The positions of the equilibria, the rates of interconversion and the relative solubilities of the two forms are such that in each case either essentially pure dicarbonyl or essentially pure dihapto-acyl can be isolated from solution. The dihapto-mode of bonding has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography for two of the derivatives. CNp-tolyl also adds to the 16 electron organo-compounds in an analogous fashion and equilibrium with the corresponding dihapto-iminoacyl compounds is attained in some cases. The dihapto-iminoacyl formulation has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Factors affecting the positions of all these equilibria are discussed and the possible relevance of these dihapto-acyl and -iminoacyl complexes as models for the proposed intermediates in the CO and CNR insertion reactions is noted. Compounds containing cis-H,R ligands are rarely stable since reductive elimination of R-H usually occurs very readily. Species of this type, therefore, appear to be ideal precursors for reactive, low valent complexes which are unobtainable by other means. A synthetic route has been developed by which an hydrido ligand can be incorporated into the coordination sphere of the new organo-derivatives described in chapter 1. The key step involves the thermal decarboxylation of a dihapto-formate ligand. In this way remarkably stable cis-H, tolyl complexes of osmium have been prepared. Toluene is eliminated from these derivatives only under forcing conditions. In contrast, reductive elimination from the analogous ruthenium complexes proceeds much more rapidly and in only one case has a stable hydrido, aryl complex been isolated. Other compounds that have been formed by this route are the zerovalent complex Ru(CO)(dppe)&#8322; and the ortho-metallated complex Ru(C6H&#8324;PPh&#8322;)H(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;. Factors affecting the rates of all these reactions are discussed. Some reactions of Ru(C&#8326;H&#8324;PPh&#8322;)H(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; have been investigated, and most notably a methyl, formate complex is produced with formaldehyde and a small amount of a dichlorocarbene complex with CCl&#8324;. The reactions of this ortho-metallated compound may proceed via the intermediate "Ru(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;". Extension of the synthetic procedure described in chapter 1 has led to the production of the dichlorocarbene complex OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CCl&#8322;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;, the structure of which has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This compound, which formally contains an Os-Ccarbene double bond, provides the subject matter for chapter 4. The carbene carbon atom is attacked by nucleophiles and the chloride substituents are easily displaced. This species therefore behaves as a remarkably versatile synthetic intermediate. Reaction with the chalcogen hydrides HX&#8315; (or H&#8322;X) leads to the corresponding chalcocarbonyl derivatives and OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CTe)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; is the first tellurocarbonyl complex to be isolated. Characterization of this complex includes an X-ray crystallographic analysis. Primary mines react with OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CCl&#8322;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; to form the corresponding coordinated isocyanides and reactions with other nucleophiles are also discussed. The most important of these, however, is the reaction with Li(p-tolyl). This produces the monomeric carbyne complex, Os(Cp-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;, the structure of which has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This compound has an extremely short Os-Ccarbyne bond length and this is consistent with a triple bond formulation. The synthesis and chemistry of this compound is discussed in chapter 5. Although other carbyne complexes have been isolated previously this is a relatively new area of organometallic chemistry and reports of the chemistry of these species are restricted mainly to compounds of the GpVIa and VIIa metals. Os(Cp-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; displays a rather different chemistry from these compounds and some new reactions have been observed. Electrophiles such as H&#8330; and Cl&#8322; readily attack Ccarbyne and the corresponding carbene complexes are formed. This suggests that Ccarbyne is nucleophilic. The elements S, Se and Te add to the Os-Ccarbyne triple bond under ambient conditions to give the corresponding dihapto-chalcoacyl complexes. Adducts of the Os-Ccarbyne triple bond are also formed with the GpIb metals and the structure of Os(C{p-tolyl}AgCl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Analogues of all these reactions are to be found in acetylene chemistry. In contrast to the cationic carbyne complexes of the GpVIa and VIIa metals, Ccarbyne in [Os(Cp-tolyl)(CO)&#8322; (PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; is not attacked by nucleophiles. Instead LiBHEt&#8323; preferentially attacks the para-carbon atom of the Ccarbyne p-tolyl substituent and an Os(O) vinylidene complex is formed. The structure of this compound has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Although the aromatic ring is destroyed in this reaction it is replaced by an extensively conjugated system which reaches through to the osmium atom. Further reactions of this species and the cationic carbyne complex [Os(Cp-tolyl)(CO)(CNp-tolyl)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds f.sp. pinea Dingley &amp; Gilmour: its persistence in soil and its infectivity of Pinus radiata D.

Don seedlings were studied. Sampling procedures were compared in the search of soils for fungal propagules. Those most frequently used were soil dilution plate method, surface-soil dilution plate technique, and plating of debris picked from soil. A selective medium for direct isolation from soil was prepared comprising potato dextrose agar as the basal medium and incorporating benomyl (50 ppm), quintozene (7.5 or 75 ppm), streptomycin sulfate (100 ppm), chloramphenicol (100 ppm) and chlortetracycline HCl (100 ppm). Studies in plots at Auckland, Tokoroa and Rotorua indicated that fungal structures within P. radiata debris persisted for long periods; up to 25 months in the Auckland plots. In vitro, the viability of conidia in natural soil declined very rapidly; more than 50% of conidia were non-viable within 4 weeks of their introduction into soil incubated at 15 and 25 C. Similar experiments conducted at different matric potentials indicated that drier soils (-0.3 or -0.4 bar) had higher levels of viable conidia over periods of time compared to wetter soils of -0.1 bar or at saturation. Segments of pine seedlings introduced to soils into which various concentrations of conidia were previously incorporated showed increasing colonization with increasing conidial concentration at both 15 and 25 C after 4 days. Maximum colonization of segments occurred at conidial concentrations 106 ml-1 to 107 ml-1. Artificially-inoculated segments of pine seedlings were introduced into soil and then these were recovered at different time periods. After two months in soil 100% recovery of the fungus was obtained from all leaf, stem and root segments plated. Recovery levels from all the plated stem and root segments after 8.5 months were never lower than 68%. Recovery levels from leaf segments were lower because many of these had decomposed leaving only the central xylem strands. Conidia-laden membrane filters were introduced into soil. A method of microscopic study used after removal of these from soil enabled easy observation of resultant structures. Appressoria were formed while the fungus was in soil. Other potential survival propagules were thick-walled, darkly-pigmented, short hyphae within pine debris. It is considered that the short individual cells of such hyphae could survive as chlamydospores, and these are believed to be the prime means of long-term survival in soil. Several fumigants were tested for effectiveness in eradication of the fungus from soil. All chemicals tested, namely chloropicrin, methyl bromide, "Di-Trapex" and dazomet significantly reduced viability of conidia and the fungus in pine debris. Weeds from a pine nursery were inoculated with conidia; of these, only Epilobium ciliatum Raf. became infected. Infection of healthy parts was infrequent but saprophytic growth in older parts frequently killed the plant. This species is therefore a potential alternative host, although its importance as an inoculum source for infection of pine seedlings is unknown. Experimentally it was shown that infection could occur by rain splash of conidia onto healthy plants. Infection of P. radiata seedlings was studied at several constant and alternating temperatures. Initial infection was greatest at higher temperatures (ca 24 C); while full symptoms of the disease were best expressed at lower temperatures (12 to 18 C). Inoculated seedlings had significantly reduced shoot and root development at 12, 15, 18 C, but not at 6, 9, 23, 24, 27 C, after 53 days. Increase in height of healthy seedlings was significantly greater than that of inoculated seedlings, after 52 days at 18 C. Pathogenicity on P. radiata seedlings of an isolate of C. acutatum f.sp. pinea isolated from soil, "whitish isolate", was comparable to the normal "coloured isolate".</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and metabolism of mammalian glycogens</field><field name="creator">Calder, Philip Charles</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The young driver: a highway warrior?</field><field name="creator">Harre, Nicole</field><field name="description">Young drivers have high rates of injury in New Zealand and throughout the Western world. It is commonly perceived that a major reason for this is their tendency to engage in unsafe driving behaviours, something that has frequently been labelled &#8216;risk taking&#8217;. A study of the literature suggested that the term &#8216;risk taking&#8217; has been used in a variety of different ways and may have obscured our understanding of young people&#8217;s motives. Theories and research reviewed on the causes of unsafe driving behaviour amongst adolescents revealed a variety of potential contributors, ranging from the individual to the social. There is little evidence to implicate young women as unsafe drivers, who are most at risk as passengers. A survey of sixth form students (n=626) found high levels of unlicensed driving, breaking the rules associated with a restricted licence, failing to wear a seat belt in the back seat, speeding and being the passenger of a drinking driver. In addition, the survey found significantly more males than females reported: driving, engaging in unsafe driving behaviours, drinking and driving, speeding on the open road, breaking the night curfew associated with being on a restricted licence and dangerous thought patterns. Females were more likely to have been the passenger of a drinking driver after the last party they attended. Interviews with a sub-sample of those surveyed (n=16) revealed a number of scenarios that led to unsafe driving. These included: peer group dynamics, the adolescent sub-culture, emotional stress, an apparent lack of awareness of risk, and practical considerations. The interviews also indicated a lack of policing of the rules associated with the Graduated Driver Licensing System (G.D.L.S.). Interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of young drivers are examined and driver education is looked at in some detail. Problems with methodology made it difficult to reach clear conclusions about the efficacy of past programmes. Health education literature was analysed to ascertain what may be the ingredients of effective programmes for driving safety. An intervention study was carried out that compared a group of sixth form students who received a programme for driving safety (n=176) with a control group (n=146). Measures of attitudes, knowledge and self-reported behaviours yielded no significant differences between the two groups in either the post-test or the follow-up. A variety of reasons for this outcome are put forward, including the programme&#8217;s emphasis on thinking processes and its low fear approach. The recommendations that are made for decreasing the teenage road injury rate include: better policing of the G.D.L.S., education programmes and media campaigns that focus on the young male&#8217;s sense of personal immunity from risk, and increased availability of safe transport on occasions when young people are drinking. It is stressed that comprehensive safety plans that target all age groups are likely to have the greatest impact.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pakeha discourses of Maori/Pakeha relations</field><field name="creator">McCreanor, Tim</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a discourse analytic approach to the language used by Pakeha in talk about Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand.

Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of diabetic cardiomyopathy and its treatment by copper chelation</field><field name="creator">Glyn-Jones, Sarah</field><field name="description">Diabetes mellitus is estimated to affect approximately 7% of the populations living a western lifestyle. Of the multiple etiologies associated with diabetes, heart failure is the most common cause of death. A specific type of heart disease called diabetic cardiomyopathy is thought to be partially responsible. At this time, no one specific treatment is available for diabetic cardiomyopathy due to the wide variety of possible complex molecular changes, including metabolic disturbances, myocardial fibrosis, LV hypertrophy, and increased ROS production. Abnormal copper metabolism in diabetes has been proposed to form part of the pathway that leads to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our group have shown that treatment with the copper (CuII) chelator, triethylenetetramine, ameliorates the effects of diabetes on the heart at both the functional and molecular level. This thesis aimed to further these studies by increasing our understanding of the mechanism of triethylenetetramine action on the diabetic heart. This was primarily achieved through the use of microarray technology but included the use of a range of molecular experimental techniques. During this investigation it was determined that the most suitable microarray platform for our studies was the Affymetrix GeneChip&#174; system. Using this system we identified more than 1600 gene changes associated with diabetes in the left ventricle wall. A disproportionate number of significant messenger RNA transcript changes were associated with the mitochondria and further investigation of these genes revealed changes associated with perturbed lipid metabolism and increased oxidative stress. A second study investigated the molecular mechanisms underpinning improved cardiac function in the left ventricle of the heart from diabetic and sham animals treated with triethylenetetramine. There was an observed decrease in diabetic cardiac tissue triglyceride towards normal, possibly through improvement of the structure and stability of the mitochondria. Only a small number of changes in gene expression were detected after triethylenetetramine treatment using microarray technology, and none were detected using real time-quantitative PCR. The final aim of this thesis was to understand the absorption and excretion of triethylenetetramine by both sham and diabetic animals. Our study found differences in the ability of diabetic animals to absorb and metabolise triethylenetetramine compared to sham animals. Also, the length of exposure was found to be an influencing factor in triethylenetetramine metabolism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Copper chelation</field><field name="subject">Diabetic cardiomyopathy</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA and RNA synthesis in leaves during TYMV replication</field><field name="creator">Bedbrook, John Robert Martin</field><field name="description">1.

In vivo and in vitro labelling studies, in conjunction with HAP column chromatography, have established the existence of DS-RNA in the nuclei fraction of diseased cells.

The rate of total and nuclear DS-RNA synthesis is maximal before virus particles are detected. 5.	The asymmetry of synthesis of viral-specific DS-RNA has been followed during the development of infection in a systemically infected leaf.

Plus strand synthesis was the predominant reaction during the period of rapid virus production. 6.	DNA from the nuclei plus chloroplast fraction of healthy Chinese cabbage leaf has been fractionated into two components by HAP column chromatography: Component A-DNA which represents the bulk DNA of the cell, and component B-DNA, a minor component. 7.	In healthy tissue component B-DNA appears to be metabolically distinct from component A-DNA. This distinction has been established by differential labelling rates of the two components. 8.	Physical and biochemical studies indicate that component B-DNA consists of two species: (i) SS-DNA and (ii) DNA-RNA hybrid. 9.	The labelling rate of component A-DNA is unchanged by TYMV synthesis. The apparent labelling rate of the two species of component B-DNA is increased by virus synthesis. 10.	Detergent-solubilized nuclei plus chloroplasts from Chinese cabbage contain RNase-sensitive, actinomycin D-insensitive DNA synthesis activity.

The synthetic strategy adopted is based on a double furofuran annulation/oxidative rearrangement strategy that has been successfully used by this research group to prepare a related dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone based on the actinorhodin skeleton. The retrosynthesis that was adopted (see Scheme 1.47, page 59) required the initial preparation of a key bis-naphthoquinone 1.267 which in turn is available from bisnaphthalene 1.268 that bears acetyl groups at C-7 and C-7&#8217;. Initial work concentrated on the construction of the biaryl linkage of bis-7- acetylnaphthalene 1.268 using a palladium(0)-mediated Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the key triflate 1.269 (prepared in 10 steps from vanillin 1.271) using bis(pinacolato)diboron 1.179. This coupling method successfully afforded binaphthyls 2.8b and 2.8d which were subjected to attempts to effect either double bromination, double acetylation or double Fries rearrangement to a more functionalised biaryl system. Disappointingly, none of these methods allowed introduction of the key acetyl group at C-7 and C-7&#8217; onto the initial biaryls 2.8b and 2.8d. Attention then turned to the synthesis of the bis-7-acetylnaphthalene 1,268 that was required for the ensuing furofuran annulation reaction starting from triflate 2.7 that already contained an acetyl group at C-7, then effecting formation of the key biaryl linkage. Attempts to prepare 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 via either Fries rearrangement of acetates 2.33a or 2.9a, or via bromination of acetate 2.33a, naphthol 2.56 or benzyl ether 2.6 were unsuccessful. An alternative approach for the preparation of 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 involved the preparation of 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74 from carbamate 2.64 via a directed ortho-metalation, followed by reaction of the derived ortho-lithiated species with N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide 2.71. However, this strategy resulted only in low yields of the desired 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74, although initial model work did provide methodology for the successful conversion of carbamate 2.68 to 2-acetyl-l-naphthol 2.73. The synthetic target of this thesis shifted to the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 when attempts to introduce an acetyl group atC-7 of triflate 2.9 failed. However formation of the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b was successful from triflate 2.9b. A subsequent one-pot in situ Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of triflate 2.81b with boronate 2.89 furnished dimmer 2.76b. Oxidation of dimer 2.76b to bis-naphthoquinone 2.80 was then accomplished using silver(II) oxide and 6 M nitric acid. With the key bis-6-acetylnaphthoquinone 2.80 in hand, an efficient double furofuran annulation reaction was carried out using 2-trimethylsilyloxyfuran 1.88 affording the desired bis-furonaphthofuran adduct 2.79 as an inseparable l:l mixture of diastereomers 2.79a and 2.79b. However, initial experiments to effect the double oxidative rearrangement of bis-furonaphthofuran adducts 2.79 using either silver(Il) oxide and 6 M nitric acid or with ceric ammonium nitrate in aqueous acetonitrile to the bisfuronaphthopyran 2.7 8 were unsuccessful. Attention then turned to the preparation of bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78 from the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b via initial oxidation of triflate 2.81b to naphthoquinone 3.3 followed by furofuran annulation and then oxidative rearrangement. Attempts to effect the key Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of furonaphthofuran 3.2 to bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79, or of furonaphthopyran 3.1 to bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78, using catalyst PdCl2(dppf) and ligand dppf were unsuccessful. The work achieved herein constitutes the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for the synthesis of the crisamicin analogue 2.79. The final synthesis of the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 can be completed by preparing bis-furonaphthopyran bis-lactol 2.78 using more powerful palladium(0) catalysts and ligands for the Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the monomeric furonaphthopyran 3.1. Subsequent reduction af 2.78 using triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid will then afford the bis-cyclic ether 3.15, which can undergo deprotection of the methyl ether and epimerisation at C-5 upon treatment with excess boron tribromide to finally furnish the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77. An investigation into the double oxidative rearangement of bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79 to the bis-lactol 2.78 could also be carried out by the use of several alternative oxidising agents, such as phenyliodine(III) bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA), phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA), polymer-supported (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (PSDIB), Fremy's salt, iron trichloride or CrO3.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in ionogram analysis and interpretation</field><field name="creator">Lobb, R.

The general principles are described in detail and the procedure is applied to the valley problem in bottomside ionogram analysis. It is shown that only a single parameter, the integrated valley ionisation, is obtainable from typical ionograms. The least-squares technique is then applied to the problem of topside ionogram analysis where the facility for using any mixture of ordinary and extraordinary ray virtual depth data is very useful. The method is shown to offer many advantages over the more traditional methods. The effects of horizontal ionisation gradients on bottomside and topside ionograms are extensively investigated by a new technique for synthesising ionograms corresponding to a given model of a moving disturbance in the ionosphere. A number of interesting and important ionogram characteristics are identified and explained. Finally, the specific problem of a large disturbance seen on total electron content records during summer nights is briefly re-examined using topside ionogram data.

Diabetes is a disorder characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular complications. The relationship between these integrally linked conditions has long been recognised, and for a significant portion of individuals the two conditions co-exist as part of metabolic syndrome. The presence of diabetes increases the risk of heart failure up to fivefold and three-fold in women and men, respectively, when compared to individuals without diabetes. While there has been a significant declining trend in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the general population over the past two decades, unfortunately such trends have not been seen among diabetic patients. As a result, this has persuaded many health professionals to re-evaluate their current treatment and pharmacological regimens. It is a well established fact that oxidative stress is a contributory mechanism in many agerelated disorders including T2DM, especially in those with poor glycaemic control. Thus far, clinical trials with antioxidant or carbonyl-trapping agents have produced mixed results, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying this disorder may be more complex than previously thought. Although altered systemic regulation of trace metals in diabetes has been previously investigated, it is still unclear whether changed trace metal metabolism would cause heart disease in common forms of diabetes and whether metal chelation can reverse this condition. Our hypothesis is that the accumulation of redox-active trace metals including Cu and Fe in cardiac muscle may, at least in part, result in cardiomyopathy through the generation of excess reactive oxygen species. We believed that the administration of a specific metal chelator should ameliorate this process by increasing the excretion of free systemic Cu and Fe, consequently limiting the production of superoxide oxygen free radicals and arresting the process of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Data from pre-clinical studies conducted in our laboratory using diabetic animal model with diabetes-induced abnormal Cu metabolism have been remarkably consistent in demonstrating that oral dosing with triethylenetetramine (TETA) can effectively remove systemic Cu via increased urinary Cu excretion, improve cardiomyocyte structure, reverse elevations in left ventricular collagen and &#946;1-integrin, and alleviate heart failure, all in the presence of a consistently high circulating blood glucose profile. Taken together, these findings support the beneficial role of TETA in diabetic animal model and lay the foundation for its potential therapeutic effect in humans with diabetes. This thesis describes a series of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials that have investigated the metabolism of Cu and Fe and seven other trace metals in patients with chronic T2DM compared with non-diabetic control subjects. This thesis also examines the mechanism of action of TETA and addresses the hypothesis that a decrease in body systemic Cu pool through chelation therapy may improve cardiac complication in diabetic subjects. Trial 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled study which measured the 6d balance of Cu and Fe and seven other essential trace metals, in twenty male T2DM and twenty age-matched control subjects in whom we later probed systemic metal balance with oral TETA. Basal urinary output and balance of Cu and Fe was significantly elevated in diabetes, and the two output values correlated strongly (p&lt;0.05). 6d treatment with 2400mg/d dose of TETA (maximum Wilson&#8217;s disease dose) has increased the urinary excretion of Cu, which was predicted by basal urinary Cu excretion, thereby causing a positive Cu balance to become negative in diabetes. Regulation of Cu metabolism was shown to be abnormal in diabetes and was selectively modified by TETA, which did not concomitantly modify Fe metabolism. Moreover, TETA did not cause a negative balance in any of the other seven trace metals monitored. These findings are consistent with TETA reversing the accumulation of free systemic Cu in diabetes, which may help to explain its potential therapeutic effects in some diabetic complications. Trial 2 investigated the acute response effect of a single 2400mg dose of TETA on urinary and serum trace metals in the first 10hr and 10~24hr post-dose. The results showed that TETA markedly increased the urinary Cu and Zn excretion in diabetes for the duration of 10hrs with the maximum excretion phase between 4~6hr post-drug (p&lt;0.05). TETA did not change the metabolism of Mg and six other essential trace metals monitored. Trial 3 examined the dose-response effect of TETA, at and below the dose given to patients with the Wilson&#8217;s disease over a 7d period, on Cu and eight other trace metals in a subgroup of seven T2DM and seven control subjects who had completed trial 1. The results of this i i trial showed that there was a linear dose-response relationship over the dose range 300~2400 mg/d on urinary Cu excretion in both T2DM and control subjects. However, there was no significant difference between the two subject groups at any of the four doses tested. In addition, 300mg/d of TETA was effective in mobilizing Cu in both T2DM and healthy control subjects. Trial 4 described the full work-up of a sensitive LC-MS methodology to identify and quantify TETA and its metabolite(s) in human urine. Using the LC-MS, TETA metabolism and excretion was investigated by analysing the urine of seven T2DM and seven control subjects who received escalating doses of TETA (samples obtained from trial 3). I have successfully identified and characterised two major metabolites of TETA in the urine of both T2DM and control subjects, N1-monoacetytriethylenetetramine (MAT) and diacetytriethylenetetramine (DAT), the latter which has not been previously reported. The results from urinary TETA excretion analyses also showed that T2DM may metabolise TETA more extensively than control subjects, which in turn is associated with its higher uptake or bioavailability. Urinary Zn excretion was mainly linked with urinary TETA and MAT in T2DM and healthy controls, respectively, whereas urinary Cu excretion was associated with urinary TETA excretion in healthy controls and urinary TETA+MAT excretion in T2DM subjects. These results suggest that MAT may also be involved in the mechanism by which TETA extracts systemic free Cu in diabetes. The identification of the two major metabolites of TETA and the development of a robust analytical LC-MS methodology reported in this study is an important step to further investigate the pharmacological actions of TETA in diabetic individuals. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis and in association with previous animal and clinical studies from our laboratory have provided consistent supporting evidences for the use of TETA clinically as a safe and effective therapy to prevent the genesis of some diabetic complications, in conjunction with conventional complication modifying therapies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transition metals</field><field name="subject">Trace metals</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Trace metal balance</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">TETA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aroha mai: nurses, nursing and mental illness</field><field name="creator">Kidd, Jacqueline Dianne</field><field name="description">This research takes an autoethnographical approach to exploring the connections between being a nurse, doing nursing work, and experiencing a mental illness. Data is comprised of autoethnographical stories from 18 nurses. Drawing on Lyotard&#8217;s (1988) postmodern philosophy of &#8216;regimes of phrases&#8217; and &#8216;genres of discourse,&#8217; the nurses&#8217; stories yielded three motifs: Nursing, Tangata Whaiora (people seeking wellness) and Bullying. Motifs are recurring topical, emotional and contextual patterns which have been created in this research by means of the formation of collective stories from the content of the nurses&#8217; stories, artwork, fictional vignettes and poetry. Interpretation of the motifs was undertaken by identifying and exploring connected or dissenting aspects within and between the motifs. Using Fine&#8217;s (1994) notion of hyphenated lives, the spaces between these aspects were conceptualised as hyphens. The Nursing motif revealed a hyphen between the notion of the nurses as selfless and tireless carers, and the mastery requirements of professionalism. The nurses&#8217; hope for caring, belonging, expertise and &#8216;goodness&#8217; were also features of the nursing motif. The Tangata Whaiora motif revealed the hyphen between being a compliant patient and a self-determined person seeking wellness, and also foreshadowed the notion that the nursing identity does not &#8216;permit&#8217; the dual identities of nurse and tangata whaiora. This research has found that nurses who have experienced, or are vulnerable to, mental illness negotiate a nexus of hyphens between societal, professional and personal expectations of the nurse. Ongoing unsuccessful negotiation of their identities is exhausting and leads to enduring distress. At times, negotiation is not possible and the nurse is immobilised in a differend of silence and injustice. At such times, the only resolution possible for the nurse is to leave the nursing profession. Bullying surfaced as a feature of the hyphen between the nursing and tangata whaiora identities, as well as being a part of each identity as colonising, silencing and/or discriminatory acts. Successful negotiation between and among the nursing and tangata whaiora hyphens requires a radical restructuring of the nursing image and culture across the education, workplace and personal/clinical areas. Three strategies are proposed for the discipline of nursing to achieve this change: transformatory education, a conscientisation programme, and mandatory emancipatory clinical supervision.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental distress</field><field name="subject">nurses and nursing</field><field name="subject">hyphenated lives</field><field name="subject">bullying</field><field name="subject">caring mastery</field><field name="subject">medal model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the emergence of a shared services organisation: Managing change in complex health ICT projects</field><field name="creator">Day, Karen Jean</field><field name="description">Although there is a high risk of failure in the implementation of ICT projects (which appears to extend to health ICT projects), we continue to implement health information systems in order to deliver quality, cost-effective healthcare. The purpose of the research was to participate in and study the change management as a critical success factor in health ICT projects, and to examine people&#8217;s responses to change so as to develop understanding and theory that could be used in future change management programmes. The research was conducted within the context of a large infrastructure project that resulted from the emergence of a shared services organisation (from two participating District Health Boards in Auckland, New Zealand). Action research (AR) formed the basis of the methodology used, and provided the foundation for a change management programme: the AR intervention. Grounded theory (GT) was used for some of the data analysis, the generation of themes by means of constant comparison and the deeper examination of the change process using theoretical sampling. AR and GT together supported the development of theory regarding the change process associated with health ICT projects. Health ICT projects were revealed in the findings as exhibiting the properties of complex adaptive systems. This complexity highlighted the art of change management as a critical success factor for such projects. The fabric of change emerged as a composite of processes linked to project processes and organisational processes. The turning point in the change process from the before state to the after state is marked by a capability crisis which requires effective patterns of leadership, sensitive targeting of communication, effective learning, and management of increased workload and diminishing resources during the course of health ICT projects. A well managed capability crisis period as a component of change management can substantially contribute to health ICT project success.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems	280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AP1: A Platform for Model-Based Software Engineering</field><field name="creator">Lutteroth, Christof</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the AP1 system, which serves as a platform for model-based CASE technology. AP1 is a set of libraries and tools that support different activities in the software development process. It provides different layers of reusable CASE functionality, and thus facilitates CASE tool development and integration. Some key problems of software development are addressed, such as the storage and management of artifacts, their creation and modification, and the generation of program code. The main parts of the abstract platform are a typed repository for models and model data, and a generic editor that acts as an integrated software development environment (IDE). The former enables data integration; the latter serves as a basis for presentation integration. Both parts have an extensible and customizable architecture that makes it possible for developers to adapt the system to their own individual needs.  The thesis discusses different data models, explaining why the parsimonious data model was chosen for the repository. A mapping onto the relational data model is given that makes it possible to leverage a RDBMS for data management. On top of the RDBMS, the AP1 system implements new mechanisms for caching, event notification and change control, resulting in a unique architecture. The thesis introduces novel concepts of robustness and reflection for user interfaces, and delineates their implementation in the generic editor. Furthermore, a concept for code generators is presented that offers a particularly high degree of type-safety, which we call generator type-safety.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">model-based software engineering</field><field name="subject">model-based development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental analysis of the psychological effect of head injury</field><field name="creator">Gronwall, D. M. A. (Dorothy M. A.)</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate consequences of concussion. Previous work had either concentrated on memory defects only, included cases of cerebral damage as well as concussion, or examined residual defects persisting after the period of impaired consciousness had ended. It was hoped to determine which function or functions might be affected in concussion by testing only young adult cases of 'pure' concussion in the immediate post-traumatic period. In the main experiment a paced serial addition task was administered to a mildly concussed (MC) and seriously concussed (SC) group at twenty-four-hourly intervals during the hospital period, and thirty to forty days after discharge. A normal control and hospital control group were given the task at similar time intervals. Recent concussion impaired performance and SC Ss needed almost five times as long as controls to process each correct response while MC Ss were about twenty per cent slower, However, responses were qualitatively similar in all groups, and concussed Ss differed only in producing many more late response errors. At retest the MC group had regained control level, but although SC Ss had significantly improved PASAT scores they were still poorer than the other three groups. Experiments II and III investigated stages in the information transmission process which may have produced restricted information processing shown by PASAT results. Reaction and movement times were not longer than normal, although central processing time was. MC Ss did not have significantly slower non-symbolic RTs, or symbolic two- and four-choice RTs, but they differed significantly from controls on eight- and ten-choice symbolic trials. Again this difference between groups was not found at retest four weeks later. Results suggested inefficient 'pigeon-holing' (Broadbent, 1971) as a possible factor in reduced information transmission following concussion. However, a message repetition task indicated no difference between concussed and non-concussed Ss in use of this mechanism. Message repetition also demonstrated that patients had no difficulty in auditory perception of verbal material. In the third stage, normal Ss were given message repetition with and without a concurrent distracting task. Performance during distraction was sufficiently similar to that of recently concussed Ss to suggest that the patient group may have been poorer than controls on the same task only because they also had reduced processing capacity. When given PASAT with a secondary paced task, performance of another group of normal Ss was almost identical to concussed Ss in the first experiment. Finally, to test the possibility that reduced processing capacity was the result of increased distractability, that is, processing task-irrelevant stimuli, an attention task (speech shadowing) was given to a small group of MC Ss and normal controls. There were no instances of intrusions or interference from an irrelevant message to indicate a defect in selective attention, although MC Ss had significantly lower shadowing scores. It was concluded that reduction in processing capacity produced by concussion was a function of patients' lower level of arousal, and that performance resembled that reported in the literature from sleep-deprived Ss and cases of brain-stem damage or dysfunction. A feature of results was the extremely competent performance exhibited by concussion patients, given a reduction in total capacity. Similar optimizing behaviour was evident during distraction tasks, and it was suggested that ability to monitor and control distribution of available processing space by instructions ('set') is a general characteristic of ordered behaviour. This ability was not disturbed by degrees of concussion sustained by experimental Ss in this study. Amnesic symptoms of the immediate post-traumatic period were considered in terms of lowered arousal level. It was proposed that these might be explained by a combination of two factors: (i) processing space insufficient to store items while responding to them, and (ii) tagging of items in storage with levels of concurrent background activity, and thus 'state-dependent' memory. Evidence for a processing deficit existing after termination of the period of PTA was reviewed, and the possibility of permanent effect in terms of increased disability following repeated concussions. Some aspects of results important in considering rehabilitation programmes for head-injured patients were noted.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disclosure Rules, Manager Discretion and the Relative Informativeness of Earnings Components</field><field name="creator">Teixeira, Alan</field><field name="description">This is a study of earnings quality, examining whether components of earnings based on New Zealand (N.Z.) accounting classification systems have different information parameters. The N.Z. environment provides a unique opportunity to examine a period with no legislative backing of accounting standards and a flexible accounting standard. Combined, this gave mangers the ability to clearly identify earnings components they considered to be differentially informative. Informativeness is assessed by the ability of current period earnings to predict next period earnings and the contemporaneous relation between returns and earnings. The results indicate that disaggregated reported earnings are more informative than aggregated earnings in a non-trivial way. In one of the sample periods disaggregated earnings explained 29% of the variance in returns, more than twice the explanatory power of aggregated earnings. N.Z. accounting standard setters replaced SSAP7 with FRS7 in 1994 contending that the discretion available to mangers reduced the informativeness of earnings. Not only do the results not support that contention but earnings informativeness has fallen since FRS7 came into effect, suggesting that standard setters should revisit that decision. The results also have implications for the content and form of the N.Z. Stock Exchange (NZSE) preliminary announcement. "Unusual earnings" reported to the NZSE by companies are shown to be differentially informative to investors yet the NZSE does not always identify these components when the preliminary announcement is summarised and disseminated to market participants. To summarise, the effective codification of earnings brought about by FRS7 has reduced the informativeness of earnings &#8211; locking differences between components into total earnings. The N.Z. results beg the question as to whether similar economic events are locked into the COMPUSTAT summary earnings variables for U.S. data.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the etiology of the leaf blotch disease of Eucalyptus spp. caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke) Hansf</field><field name="creator">Ganapathi, Alhagananthan</field><field name="description">A detailed study of the leaf blotch disease, caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke.) Hansf. on Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell (Mountain Ash) and E. delegatensis R.T. Baker (Syn. E. gigantea Hook. F., Alpine Ash) was made. The taxonomy of the fungus was studied(illustrations provided) and a previously unidentified imperfect state (Colletogloeum nubilosum) was described along with the spermagonial state (Asteromella). The histology and mode of infection process by ascospores and conidia was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy, and wax and epoxy resin sections. The development of the fungus within the host was studied up to the stage of mature pseudothecia. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissue and Koch's postulates were carried out to prove pathogenicity. Detailed development of the leaf blotch and twig canker symptoms was followed in the field and in glasshouse conditions. The effect of substrate and environmental conditions on growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. Controlled environment chambers and glasshouses were used. Several day/night temperature combinations (12/6, 18/12, 24/18 and 30/24C) as well as several light levels (50, 75, 150, 200, 300 and 650 &#956;E) were investigated. The optimum temperature for infection was 24/18C and least infection occurred at 12/6C. The optimum light level for infection was 300 to 650 &#956;E while the slowest infection was obtained at 50 and 75 &#956;E. Under constant temperature conditions infection was most severe at 18C for both E. delegatensis and E. regnans. Wetness periods under sprinklers of one to seven days were compared with similar incubation periods in polythene bags. One-day incubation produced very little infection compared with 2, 4 or 7 days. Incubation in polythene bags gave better results than sprinklers. Experiments showed that leaf and stem infection was not affected by nutrient levels. Leaf expansion rates for both the eucalypt species were followed for twelve weeks to determine the optimum leaf size for infection. Fungicide trials in the field and in-vitro suggested that several chemotherapeutants may be effective in controlling the disease. Diseased leaves from field trials were assessed for ascospore discharge to determine fungal viability. From this study it was shown that diseased (inoculated)"plants lost significantly more leaves than controls. If conditions were optimum for infection, tips of inoculated plants were killed, leading to stem distortion, branching and reduced growth. In general, the fungus causes severe damage on susceptible Eucalyptus spp. in sapling stages.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The second language acquisition of Mandarin nominal syntax</field><field name="creator">Charters, Areta Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis establishes a natural acquisition order for 18 nominal structures in Mandarin SLA, and assesses the extent to which that order can be explained as a consequence of cognitive processing demands. The natural acquisition order is based on a longitudinal study of three adults learning Mandarin in a classroom environment in Auckland, New Zealand. Two representatives of an average emergence order are derived from the three individual orders: a ranking of mean emergence times (RMT) and a ranking of mean emergence ranks (RMR). Processing demands are calculated in three different ways: once on the basis of six developmental stages identified in Pienemann&#8217;s Processability Theory (Pienemann, 1998c), once on the basis of a detailed analysis of each nominal structure according to the generative grammar of LFG (Bresnan, 1982, 2001); and finally on the basis of the Minimalist Programme (Chomsky 1995; 1999; 2000). All rest upon a prior analysis of lexical feature structures and constituent structures evident in the learner&#8217;s output over the course of a year. The standard six-stage model of Processability Theory proves unable to differentiate between most nominal structures, because they fall within the single developmental category of so-called &#8216;phrasal&#8217; structures. However, processing demands calculated on the basis either of LFG or of the MP prove to be highly correlated with both individual and average emergence orders. On the basis of these results, various generalisations are made about the relevance of different kinds of syntactic processes to the determination of emergence order. In particular, c-structural complexity and thematic structure are found to be factors most significantly associated with later emergence times. LFG and MP each provide interesting insights into different aspects of syntactic processing that impact on the acquisition of a second language; LFG throws light on the significance of the grammaticalisation of thematic structure; the MP throws light on the processes of lexical construction, and the interactions between this and constituent structure. Both indicate the significance of delays in feature valuation or unification as c-structural complexity increases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420114 Chinese languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytokinins and the division or expansion of plant cells</field><field name="creator">Beuning, Lesley L.</field><field name="description">The effect of cytokinins was studied in three systems: the alga Chlorella, callus cultures and etiolated cucumber cotyledons. In Chlorella cultures: 1) A range of concentrations of 6BA and IP had no effect on growth; 2) Low concentrations of an anticytokinin had no effect on growth, whereas higher concentrations appeared to be inhibitory. 3) Characterisation of the Chlorella species suggested that it was surrounded by an impermeable sporopollenin layer which hindered the uptake of cytokinin. 4) The uptake of radioactive adenine occurred readily, whereas the uptake of radioactive 6BA was very slow in both growing and saturated cultures of Chlorella. 5) Extracts isolated from Chlorella and the medium in which Chlorella was growing contained cytokinin-like activity in two bioassays. 6) HPLC analyses of these extracts showed that there were fractions which eluted at the positions of IP and IPA. In callus cultures: A.1) A carrot callus was grown from the secondary phloem of the storage root of carrot. 2) This callus, which was grown on 2,4-D and kinetin, produced roots and shoots when subcultured onto IAA and kinetin. 3) Growth on 2,4-D alone was independent of the presence of kinetin. 4) Growth was inhibited in the presence of an anticytokinin, suggesting that the callus produced a cytokinin. B.1) A tobacco callus was grown from a young leaf of tobacco. 2) This callus habituated to cytokinin independence following subculture onto lower concentrations of kinetin. 3) Subculture of the habituated callus onto a higher concentration of kinetin resulted in the production of roots and shoots. C.1) Cytokinin-dependent soybean and tobacco callus cultures were obtained from the Botany Department, University of Otago. 2) Analysis of the total proteins from suspension and callus cultures of soybean by 1-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one small 6BA-induced change in the proteins from the suspension cultures. In etiolated cucumber cotyledons: 1) 6BA caused the expansion of excised etiolated cucumber cotyledons after a 24h-hour incubation in the dark in a solution containing 6BA, in comparison to cotyledons incubated in water only. 2) The cotyledons curved upwards and in the light microscope the cells of the vascular bundles and the lower epidermis exhibited greater expansion than the upper epidermis. 3) Electron microscopic examination showed that the central vacuole of palisade cells from cotyledons treated with 6BA had expanded and that the cytoplasm had probably lost water and was compressed by the vacuole against the cell wall. 4) In contrast to other research, there was no apparent increase in polysome formation in 6BA-treated cotyledons in comparison to untreated cotyledons examined in the electron microscope. 5) A number of protein extraction methods were tried before a method was found which produced a protein extract suitable for both 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. 6) 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that a number of proteins either increased or decreased following the treatment of cotyledons with 6BA. 7) A number of RNA extraction methods were tried, to obtain RNA suitable for translation in vitro. Only one method produced RNA which appeared to be free of contaminating substances. Weak translation of this RNA was obtained in vitro and it might be possible to develop conditions for optimal translation of the RNA given an adequate supply of an in vitro translation system.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Metabolism of Plant Cells in Tissue Culture</field><field name="creator">Bellamy, A. R.</field><field name="description">1.	A tobacco cell-suspension tissue culture system derived from pith cells of Nicotiana tabacum L. var Wisconsin 38 was established. This system was used to study methods of purifying nucleic acids, phosphate ester and nucleic acid metabolism in cells subjected to nutritional shifts, and problems relating to the control of cell division in plant cells. 2.	Cell cultures consisting of single cells, groups of cells and small aggregates were maintained in liquid medium on rotary shakers. Cultures exhibited an exponential growth period during which the cell generation time was 2, 3 days. 3.	Cells removed from culture medium and resuspended in dilute inorganic salt solutions (step-down nutritional shift) exhibited marked changes in their phosphate and sulphate accumulation rates and in phosphate ester metabolism, but not in the type and rate of respiration. 4.	Such metabolic responses to culture shifts were not related to cell damage or shock effects, but appeared to be a feature of changes in the nutritional environment of cells. The response of cells to a step-down nutritional shift was maximal at exponential- and late-stationary phases of culture growth. Step-up nutritional shifts (resuspending cells in enriched culture medium) produced some effects similar to those found for step-down cells. Actinomycin D did not prevent the phosphate accumulation response of cells to culture shifts, and was shown to inhibit only 50 per cent of the synthesis of rapidly-labelled ribonucleic acid. 5.	RNA prepared from tobacco cells or rat liver by conventional phenol extraction was contaminated with other materials which composed as much as sixty per cent of the weight of the total preparation. RNA prepared from (32P) tobacco cells contained minor radioactivity in RNA but major radioactivity in a wide range of contaminating phosphate esters of high specific radioactivity. 6.	Purification of RNA by the Kirby two-phase partition procedure removed most major contaminants but failed to remove (32P) phosphate esters. The procedure also resulted in degraded RNA. 7.	A new method was developed for the purification of RNA prepared by the phenol procedure. It involved recovery of RNA from the upper phase of the two-phase Kirby extraction mixture by precipitation as the cetyltrimethylammonium (CETA) salt instead of by dialysis.  This procedure reduced manipulation times and much more effectively removed RNAase and (32P) phosphate esters from the RNA. 8.	TMV-RNA prepared by the new procedure was fully infectious. RNA prepared and purified from a mixture of whole rat liver and TMV was almost equally as infectious as RNA prepared from TMV alone. Infectivity of purified RNA, prepared from a mixture of tobacco cells and TMV, was stable in solution at 30&#176;C for four hours. TMV-RNA prepared in this way and stored at -12&#176;C in vacuo over P2O5 retained infectivity for at least 6 months. 9.	Extraction of (32P) exponential-phase cells by aqueous phenol plus detergent released only RNA with the ribosomal type of base composition. Similar extractions in the presence of high salt concentrations released this RNA together with DNA and rapidly-labelled RNA. 10.	During short treatments with (32P) orthophosphate, exponential-phase cells synthesised RNA with a base composition intermediate between that of ribosomal RNA and DNA. Cells subjected to a step-down nutritional shift prior to treatment with (32P) orthophosphate, synthesised RNA with a base composition close to that of tobacco DNA. 11.	Following treatment times with (32P orthophosphate, or (32P) plus (3H) uridine, and following a step-down or steady-state nutritional shift to non-radioactive medium, tobacco cells exhibited the following changes in phosphate ester and RNA metabolism:- a.	Changes in the levels of radioactivity present in the nucleoside triphosphate RNA precursors and other phosphate esters. b.	A reduction in the rate of increase of specific radioactivity of RNA of step-down cells, followed by a subsequent recovery. c.	Changes in the (32P) base composition of the RNA synthesised following the culture shift. d.	Changes in the radioactive sedimentation profiles of RNA. 12.	Extracts prepared from exponential-phase tobacco cells contained cytokinin (cell division stimulant) activity. Fractionation of cells, and bioassay of levels of cytokinins present in the various fractions, demonstrated the presence of soluble compounds with cytokinin activity in cell debris and cytoplasmic fractions, but not in the nuclear fraction. 13.	Unhydrolysed (polymeric) tobacco nucleic acids (RNA plus DNA), prepared from exponential-phase tobacco cells, showed no cytokinin activity. A ribonucleotide mixture prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of these tobacco-cell nucleic acid preparations, mixtures of purified ribonucleotides, or a mixture of tobacco deoxyribo- and ribonucleosides resulting from snake-venom digestion, contained no activity. Deoxyribonucleotides were inhibitory. 14.	A ribonucleotide mixture prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of RNA isolated from rat liver and sheep liver, contained cytokinin activity. Deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside mixtures resulting from snake-venom digestion of sheep-liver RNA and DNA contained similar levels of cytokinin activity to that found in extracts prepared by alkaline hydrolysis.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dehydrochlorination of 1,1-diaryl-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in protic and dipolar aprotic solvents</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ronald James</field><field name="description">PART I A general introduction is given to the mechanisms of olefin-forming &#946;-elimination. The development of mechanistic criteria and their application to the various reactions is discussed. Conflicting theories concerning the nature of the transition states of E2H reactions in protic solvents as well as the Winstein-Parker E2C-like transitions states for elimination by weak bases in dipolar aprotic solvents are described. PART II The use of primary deuterium isotope effects: structure-reactivity relationships, and rate-acidity correlations as mechanistic criteria for the E2 mechanism and the variants of the E1cB mechanism is reviewed. These criteria have been applied to the dehydrochlorination of the 1,1-diaryl-2, 2, 2-trichloroethanes (DDT-type compounds) with methoxide-methanol and t-butoxide-t-butanol. Literature comparisons indicate that the kinetic evidence for these two systems is in accord with an "irreversible" E1cB elimination pathway. PART III Characteristics of weak base-promoted eliminations in dipolar aprotic advents are reviewed. The evidence is not entirely consistent with either E2C or the E2H mechanism. Deuterium isotope effects and equilibrium constants are reported for the chloride ion-promoted elimination of the 1, 1-diary1-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in dimethylformamide and acetone respectively.

Chapter 1 comprises: a review of Vaska's compound, IrCl(CO) (PPh3)2 and related species, covering syntheses, structure and bonding and reactions of this very widely studied moiety; and brief reviews of metal-thiocarbonyl syntheses and reactions and metal-selenocarbonyl chemistry. These three reviews background the themes developed in this work; of preparations and reactions, particularly ligand reactions, of thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl analogues of Vaska's compound and species derived from IrCl(CE)(PPh3)2, E = S, Se. A new synthesis of IrCl(CS)(PPh3)2 is described in Chapter 2. The route employed involves preparation of dithioester complexes and facets of the reactivity of these species have been considered and a number of metallocycle derivatives prepared. Reductions of coordinated-thiocarbonyl groups have been considered; IrH(CS)(PPh3)3 was transformed into IrH2(SMe)(PPh3)3 by treatment with hydrogen, while the thiocarbonyl cation complexes [IrClX(CO)(CS)-(PPh3)2]+ were treated with borohydride to afford thioformyl species. Iridium alkyl, thiocarbonyl complexes have been prepared, and transformed by reaction with dithiocarbamate ion to yield monohapto-thioacetyl derivatives. The preparation of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2, the selenocarbonyl analogue of Vaska's compound is reported in Chapter 3. The synthesis utilizes carbon diselenide as the selenocarbonyl source, and involves a four-step conversion of a dihapto-carbon diselenide adduct complex to the iridium(I) selenocarbonyl species. Reactions of a range of iridium(I) complexes with carbon diselenide are described, including the preparation of a complex including three CSe2 groups. Reactions of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 have been studied and several iridium(I) and (III) selenocarbonyl compounds prepared. The ready reduction of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 (in the presence of phosphine) by borohydride to give IrH2(SeMe)(PPh3)3 is described and comparisons are drawn between the relative reactivities of iridium thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl groups, in analogous species, with nucleophiles. It is concluded the Ir-CSe system is more reactive under similar conditions. Metallocycle derivatives of iridium selenocarbonyl, diselenomethylester complexes have been characterised.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal studies of some organic natural products and inorganic compounds of structural interest</field><field name="creator">Brown, Kevin L.

Both of these isomers were obtained from the methoxyalkene (11), which was isolated in a pure form during selective epoxidation of the methoxyalkene mixture (11 - 13) obtained from the decarboxylation of 12-methoxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (2) with lead tetraacetate. This reaction has been investigated, and a mechanism accounting for the formation of nondecarboxylation products is proposed. The unsaturated ketoester (102) was prepared in low yield via the saturated C12 ketone (24), obtained from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (1) by Birch reduction of the aromatic ring. A number of ring A epoxide derivatives of the acid(1) were prepared and cleaved by a variety of reagents to give the 3-oxygenated derivatives (145), (146), and (152), together with compounds possessing a contracted ring A. Some ring B lactone derivatives of the acid (1) were prepared, and their stereochemistry and conformation were determined by n.m.r. spectroscopy. The conformation of some ring B-substituted derivatives was also determined by n.m.r. methods. The bromination of some 7-ketopodocarpa-8,11,13-triene derivatives was investigated, and reasons are advanced for the non-stereospecific reactions observed in some cases.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrological variation in the Banks Islands, New Hebrides</field><field name="creator">Barsdell, Mark</field><field name="description">The Banks Islands represent the most northern group of volcanic islands in the linear Central Chain of Pliocene - Recent age in the New Hebrides. A study o f the petrological variation in these northern islands provides a basis for the development of a petrogenetic-tectonic model which is applicable to most, if not all, the Central Chain islands. Integration of petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data on each island in the Banks Group has revealed a systematic petrological variation across the islands, represented chemically by a decrease in K20 (and related incompatible elements) away from the New Hebrides trench. The correlation with depth to the Benioff zone is therefore the reverse of that typically found in island arcs. REE evidence and source modelling based on this data indicates that this variation represents a progressive depletion in LREE/HREE in the upper mantle, laterally away from the trench. The variation also represents a progressive increase in partial melting of the source, in the same direction. However partial melting differences alone could not produce the observed variation. The variation in source composition and degree of partial melting are blended in to a model in which the compositional variation is attributed to an earlier west-facing Miocene subduction event, and the variation in degree of partial melting is a function of the location of the islands with respect to the postulated heat source: the active back-arc basin. The enrichment of the upper mantle in the Miocene is ascribed to the ascent of hydrous fluids enriched in incompatible elements, from the west-dipping Benioff zone, and subsequent reaction with the overlying upper mantle. The model thus envisages approximately contemporaneous development of the Central Chain volcanoes and the back-arc basin in the late Pliocene, with partial melting of hydrous, laterally zoned upper mantle resulting from the convective thermal regime associated with the rifting apart of the back-arc basin. The role of the present subduction regime in magma generation is considered very limited. The mineralogical and geochemical data show that all compositions in the range from basaltic andesite to dacite (ie. &gt; 53wt.% SiO2) in the Banks Islands can be derived from basalts by fractional crystallization of the observed phenocryst phases (including magnetite in the Gaua suite), after allowances have been made for inherited differences between some melt fractions. Together with the paucity of andesites in the Central Chain, this suggests that the primary melts of the Pliocene - Recent volcanism are basaltic. The generation of calc-alkaline magmas in the early Miocene are also believed to have involved basaltic primary melts as both the Miocene Eastern and Western belts are dominantly basaltic.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magpies: negotiations of centre and periphery in settings of New Zealand poems by New Zealand composers, 1896 to 1993</field><field name="creator">Shieff, Sarah</field><field name="description">The thesis will show that a distinctive New Zealand voice in the arts may be found not in an "essence", as has sometimes been suggested, but at chronologically specific intersections of discourses. Each of the six works I examine has been made in New Zealand and is a mixture of music and language. As generic hybrids, combinations of music and language make appropriate objects of study for a thesis that explores a specific local dialogue between the 'mixture' and the 'essence', the 'hybrid' and the 'authentic', the 'indigenous' and the 'exotic', the 'local' and the 'imported', the 'centre' and the 'periphery.' Like acquisitive magpies, New Zealand artists constantly collect and select their material. They sift, save, reject and synthesise, and in so doing they create new combinations out of old ingredients. One of the characteristics of New Zealand poetry is that it has often been combined with music. There have been many collaborations between poets and musicians since colonial times. These collaborative texts occupy a complex space between art forms, just as New Zealand artists negotiate between orientations, positioning themselves between different cultural traditions. In its own process of selection, the thesis selects six works for close analysis which represent not only different periods but also different forms of synthesis. Each work represents 'New Zealand', yet what this means in practice is different in each case.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">About turn:neural mechanisms underlying visual processing of rotated letters and digits</field><field name="creator">Milivojevic, Branka</field><field name="description">This thesis explores neural activity associated with processing of rotated alphanumeric characters, focusing particularly on linear and quadratic trend components of orientation-dependent activity. Choice of these components was driven by results of reaction-time (RT) studies; judging whether characters are normal or backward (parity task) typically elicit RTs that are linearly related to character disorientation, implying mental rotation of the characters to the upright, while judging whether they are letters or digits (categorisation task) elicits RTs related nonlinearly to disorientation, combining both linear and quadratic component, but not indicative of mental rotation. In Experiment 1 neural activity was monitored using fMRI while participants performed these tasks. In the next two experiments, neural processing was monitored with high-density EEG. In Experiment 2 participants performed the same two tasks, while in Experiment 3 they performed the category task and red-blue colour judgements. In Experiment 1, linear increases in fMRI activation were elicited only by the parity task and were observed in the posterior portion of the dorsal intraparietal sulcus and lateral and medial pre-supplementary motor areas, suggesting a fronto-parietal network underlying mental rotation. Experiment 2 showed that linear increases in parietal negativity between 350 and 710 ms only evident in the parity task, again indicating that mental rotation is only elicited by that task. Contrary to previous evidence, Experiment 2 indicated that both hemispheres may be involved in mental rotation, but rotation is faster in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. Experiment 1 also showed that effects of orientation common to both tasks were best characterised by a quadratic trend, and were restricted to the supramarginal gyrus. This activation was interpreted as representing orientation-dependent shape recognition. Experiments 2 and 3 also revealed orientation-dependent neural activity at three distinct stages prior to mental rotation. First, on the P1 component, there was a difference between oblique and vertical orientations, suggesting the extraction of orientation based on axis of elongation. Next, orientation affected the N1 component, with longer latencies and larger amplitudes with misorientation, and smaller effects for inversion than for intermediate angular rotations. Finally, changes in orientation affected the P2 component differently for the parity and category tasks, probably signalling the perception of orientation relative to a parity-defined memory representation, and serving as a preparation for mental rotation. These experiments identify both the orientation-specific neural processing that occurs prior to the onset of mental rotation, and the subsequent neural correlates of mental rotation itself.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Object recognition</field><field name="subject">Spatial orientation</field><field name="subject">Mental rotation</field><field name="subject">Neural mechanisms</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amplitude resolution by human and ideal observers for Rayleigh noise and other Gaussian processes</field><field name="creator">Hautus, Michael J. (Michael John)</field><field name="description">The ability of human observers to discriminate aural differences in the amplitude of sinusoids, narrow-band noise, and wide-band noise was measured by the rating method of detection theory. Although each sinusoid (always 1000 Hz) was presented at a fixed amplitude, its amplitude on any trial was drawn from one of two Rayleigh probability distributions that differed in mean amplitude. Similarly, the amplitudes of the narrow-band noises were distributed as the Rayleigh distribution by virtue of the reciprocal relation between their bandwidth (100 Hz centred on 1000 Hz) and duration (10 ms). The amplitudes of the wide-band noises were distributed as chi with 82 degrees of freedom. A detection-theoretic model based on chi-square density functions was fitted to the obtained receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) and psychometric functions. The best-fitting ROCs required, on the average, 4.1 degrees of freedom for the 100-ms sinusoids and 7.3 degrees of freedom for the Rayleigh noise. The best-fitting psychometric function for both the Rayleigh noise and the sinusoids required about one degree of freedom. The results obtained for these two waveforms were not significantly different. The obtained ROCs for the wide-band noise were well fitted by the chi-square model with 82 degrees of freedom and the psychometric functions with 6.1 degrees of freedom. The best-fitting parameters for the wide- and narrow-band waveforms were significantly different. Furthermore, the performance of the observers on the nmow-band waveforms was closer to that of the corresponding ideal observer than was their performance on the wide-band waveforms. For the narrow-band noise and sinusoids, the duration of the waveform affected the variability of the best-fitting degrees of freedom for the obtained ROCs. This variability was greater for waveforms of 10-ms duration (Rayleigh noise and sinusoids) than for sinusoids of 100-ms duration; this greater variability was interpreted as stemming from the difficulty of correctly windowing short-duration waveforms. Sound pressure level had no effect on the amplitude resolution of observers for four different levels of Rayleigh noise and of sinusoids. Therefore Weber's Law, and not the near miss to Weber's Law, holds for these waveforms. The chi-square detection-theoretic model provided a good fit to the data from all experiments, but not as good as predicted by statistical theory. It was concluded that the chi-square model provides a close approximation to the underlying mechanisms involved in the amplitude resolution of Gaussian noise processes.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chain (re)alignment in New Zealand&#8217;s sheep meat and dairy industries : knowledge, networks and learning at the farmer-processor site</field><field name="creator">Penny, G. M.</field><field name="description">Emerging from the agricultural crisis of the 1988s, producers and processing companies in New Zealand's sheep meat and dairy industries, found themselves in an evolving neo-liberalised environment. By the late 1990s major structural (re) alignment had taken place in production and processing to accommodate shifts in markets and regulation, centring on 'food safety', 'quality' and "availability" For both farmers and processing company staff, this meant venturing into unfamiliar jointly occupied spaces and unchartered relational territory, Through a participatory research approach using multiple methodologies, this thesis examines supply chain (re)alignment at a macro and micro-scale, focussing on the farmer-processor relationship and knowledge, network and learning processes of farmers in (global) lamb and dairy supply chains in New Zealand. In seeking to account for evolving agri-food chain relations at multiple scales, this research turns to the global commodity chains (GCC) literature and draws on pragmatic solution-oriented ideas emerging from the developing field of Supply Chain Management (SCM). It also includes theoretical input from the cognitive and behavioural sciences to interpret the empirical data on farmer's knowledge, networks and learning in different supply chains, which it argues are key features of globalising agri-food economies. In this research these literatures and theories are enveloped by a broader yet, incomplete, theoretical foundation - that of evolutionary political economy (EPE), which is extended in this thesis, The thesis argues that an EPE framework provides a useful window on the governance of New Zealand's relations at a distance because it allows the specificity of micro-scale coordination activities and relations (in jointly occupied spaces) in New Zealand to be embedded in local and macro scale governance regimes and historical development processes. The findings show global market and regulatory pressures continue to drive supply chain (re)alignment in New Zealand, and chain building is occurring in different ways at the farmer-processor interface, between and within the different industries. Farmers' place specific on-farm knowledge co-evolves with off-farm knowledge through a combination of concrete experience, trial and error, socialisation and reflection, with both on and off farm knowledge becoming more overt in practice and strategy as supply chain specifications becomes more precise. Farmers utilise a range of networks (informal, formal, specialist and general), which serve as both information channels and learning forums. New Zealand's agricultural industries are like many in competitive globalising economies -'new' know ledge is being generated and used to broker global and local social, economic and environmental contexts and values, and in the process, supply chain partners' capacities and relations evolve.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent gambling in New Zealand: an exploration of protective and risk factors</field><field name="creator">Rossen, Fiona</field><field name="description">Despite a growing appreciation in New Zealand of the harms arising from gambling, there remains a lack of knowledge and awareness of the dangers associated with participation in gambling by young people. Although international research has demonstrated that young people are a high-risk group with regard to problem gambling, research in New Zealand has only investigated the gambling behaviour of those aged 18 and over. This thesis explores a topic that has been largely neglected within New Zealand: the relevance of gambling and problem gambling for New Zealand adolescents. A questionnaire consisting of both standardised and non-standardised items, was administered to a random sample of more than 2000 secondary school students in the Upper North Island. The role of gambling in adolescent life, the prevalence of adolescent problem gambling, and associated risk factors were investigated. This research also adopted a largely unique perspective within the youth gambling field, extending investigations to include the role of protective factors, particularly social connectedness. This investigation of protective factors supports strengths-based approaches to youth behavioural issues, with the potential to aid in the prevention or minimisation of harm, as opposed to approaches that focus upon responding to problems, as is encouraged by dysfunction-based models. This research demonstrates that gambling is part of youth culture in New Zealand. It provides the first body of data detailing the practices, beliefs, and other factors associated with adolescent gambling behaviour within New Zealand. The findings indicate that choices around gambling are strongly influenced by contextual factors and that young New Zealander&#8217;s participate in a wide variety of gambling modes. While most gamble safely, approximately four percent were observed to satisfy the problem gambling criteria. Social connectedness was strongly correlated to problem gambling behaviour and the research points towards the investigation of protective factors, resiliency, and strengths-based strategies in the future. The continuing exploration of common denominators between gambling and other dangerous consumptions also offer promising avenues for future research within the gambling field. This research demonstrates that youth gambling is an issue requiring the attention of families, communities, schools, researchers, government departments, and members of the gambling industries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of diterpenoids in synthesis</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Brian D.</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis describes the use of several diterpenoids which are readily available in New Zealand for the synthesis of compounds possessing ambergris-type odours.

In the second part a simple procedure for the conversion of totarol into a C-12 oxygenated derivative is reported.

Evaluation was made in three ways: 1) Observation of large-scale geographic variation in nitrogen status in natural populations around New Zealand in summer and winter, 2) Laboratory-based experimental assessment of the biochemical responses of N-indices in Ulva to nitrogen enrichment, and 3) Culturing standardized test-Ulva under low nutrient conditions which could be deployed into a variety of field situations. Seawater inorganic nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and phosphate) concentrations and nitrogen (N)-indices (free amino acids, chlorophyll and total tissue nitrogen) in natural Ulva populations from 32 sites around New Zealand were compared. Sites were divided into 6 environmental categories: sheltered rural, exposed rural, rock pools, sheltered urban, exposed urban, and nitrogen-enriched urban sites. Seawater nutrient concentrations were highly variable between all sites in summer and winter. However, in the summer enriched urban sites had the highest mean total inorganic nitrogen concentrations and Ulva with the highest mean levels of all N-indices compared with any other environmental category. In the winter, Ulva contained more nitrogen (reflected in all N-indices) compared with Ulva in the summer, particularly in populations growing in colder southern seawater on more exposed coasts. The increase in Ulva N-status was not explained by increased seawater inorganic nitrogen concentrations. With univariate and multivariate statistical approaches it was shown that there was a significant effect of seawater temperature and site exposure on N-status in Ulva. Compared with other N-indices, stable nitrogen isotopes (&#948;15N) from Ulva growing in enriched urban sites had the widest range (4.77 &#177; 0.04 &#8240; to 15.16 &#177; 0.03 &#8240;) of values compared with all other categories in both summer and winter. Conversely, Ulva from exposed rural sites had the lowest range of &#948;15N values compared with any other category (6.7 &#177; 0.1 to 8.8 &#177; 0.1 &#8240;) and showed no seasonal change in mean values (7.8 &#8240; and 7.6 &#8240; for summer and winter, respectively). In addition, &#948;15N values in Ulva were the only N-index that showed a significant difference between urban and rural categories. To test the relationship between inorganic nitrogen concentration in seawater and the responses of biochemical nitrogen indices in Ulva pertusa, several experiments were conducted in an outdoor, flow-through culture apparatus, in summer and winter. In this apparatus effects of ammonium concentration, nitrogen source (nitrate and ammonium), light and seawater motion were investigated. Of the same three N-indices examined in natural Ulva populations (free amino acids, chlorophyll and total tissue nitrogen), increases in free amino acids, particularly asparagine, provided the strongest indicator of increases in nitrogen availability. In addition, while tissue nitrogen and chlorophyll also increased with seawater nitrogen concentration, it was apparent that these indices were also strongly influenced by light, and probably season. Rates of ammonium assimilation provided no overall measure of the availability of nitrogen in seawater and were clearly affected by season. Similarly, growth rates in Ulva only showed a response to nitrogen addition in summer months. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (&#948;15N) in Ulva provided a clear distinction between natural and synthetic nitrogen sources, but more importantly, showed only minor fractionation (ranging from 1.3 &#8240; to -1.9 &#8240;) of 15N supplied from synthetic nitrate and ammonium under both light-saturating and light-limiting conditions. To further develop Ulva as a standardized test-organism it was cultured in low-nutrient (non-polluted) seawater to deplete internal storage pools of nitrogen. Each month the resulting test-Ulva was then placed in surface-moored growth enclosures at a range of coastal sites around Auckland and then monitored for one year. In winter there were increases in seawater inorganic nitrogen concentrations and concomitant increases in free amino acid content. However, tissue nitrogen and chlorophyll content in test-Ulva showed similar increases (possibly saturating) across all sites suggesting that seasonal increases in these N-indices were also due to other seasonal factors (e.g., surface irradiance and / or seawater temperature). On the other hand, the total free amino acid pool showed strong differences between a low-nitrogen reference site and the other study sites all year round. It was probable that test-Ulva was integrating differences in tidally-averaged nitrogen loading that were not reliably detected in instantaneous seawater samples. In addition to N-indices in test-Ulva, levels of tissue heavy metals and stable isotopes of nitrogen showed strong differences with higher values of both typically found in urban environments compared with values found in non-polluted reference sites. It is concluded that several abiotic and biotic factors affect nitrogen status in Ulva, but the average nitrogen concentration in seawater, and the physical factors of temperature, light and water motion, appear to be the overarching determinants. It is further suggested that in combination with Ulva tissue &#948;15N values, tissue nitrogen and the free amino acid pool, as quantitative biochemical measures of nitrogen availability, are likely to provide useful information on both the amount and composition of nitrogen entering coastal environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ulva</field><field name="subject">algae</field><field name="subject">seaweed</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">seawater nitrogen enrichment</field><field name="subject">nitrogen metabolism</field><field name="subject">biological indicator</field><field name="subject">free amino acids</field><field name="subject">tissue nitrogen</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll</field><field name="subject">isotope d15N</field><field name="subject">seawater temperature</field><field name="subject">water motion</field><field name="subject">marine pollution</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of copper systems interacting with molecular oxygen</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the chemical, physico-chemical and structural studies of two types of copper compounds which interact with molecular oxygen in their formation. The first type is an intensely coloured species based on the ligand oxalyldihydrazide. The divalent metal and the ligand react together with simple carbonyl compounds and molecular oxygen in basic conditions to form blue species the nature of which has been the subject of conjecture for many years. This work shows that the metal is trivalent in the highly coloured states and that it acts as an oxidative catalyst with ascorbic acid. The copper (III)/copper (II) potential has been established as +0.244V by polarography. Compounds including acetaldehyde and acetone as the carbonyl component have been crystallized in monoclinic space groups. In both instances X-ray diffraction studies show that the metal is co-ordinated to a 6-5-6-5 macrocycle formed by a condensation reaction between two oxalyldihydrazide molecules and two carbonyl moieties. The co-ordination is via four deprotonated 'amide' nitrogen atoms and is of square-planar geometry. A structural study of oxalyldihydrazide has also been undertaken and comparisons are made with the co-ordinated species. The second type of compound studied is a Cu4OX6L4 cluster. It was made from a copper(I) precursor and studies with oxygen-18 gas show that formation requires oxidation to copper(II) followed by hydrolysis. Infrared evidence based on the Cu-O stretch (500-580 cm-1) is presented. Attempts to include both fluorine and iodine as the halogen component suggest that only chlorine and bromine may fill such a role.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity and change in a hospital ward : an open systems analysis</field><field name="creator">McMorland, Judith Ceridwen Irangani</field><field name="description">Using a voluntaristic theory of action and Buckley&#8217;s (1967) paradigm of complex adaptive systems, explanation of the process of change in organisations is attempted. The specific question addressed is why some changes, rather than others, are incorporated into organisational arrangements. This thesis has three parts. The first is a theoretical statement of Buckley&#8217;s model and an argument for the extension of this scheme in two important respects. The second is an extended case study of a psychiatric ward of a general hospital to which the model is applied. The third is a theoretical re-statement of the original paradigm in the light of this application. Buckley&#8217;s model was used to identify: 1.	The external and internal variety which may affect an organisation 2.	The tension-producing factors within the organisational arrangement which constrain actor&#8217;s choice of response to variety 3.	The processes whereby actors selectively map responses to variety 4.	The processes for the transmission and perpetuation of stable accommodations to variety. Two adaptations were made initially to Buckley&#8217;s scheme. To explain more fully the process of &#8216;mapping&#8217; ((3) above), two constructs are proposed, derived from the concept of the phenomenal &#8216;self&#8217;. These are &#8216;meaning system&#8217; and &#8216;dramatic repertoire of self-presentation&#8217;. Inclusion of Koestlers&#8217; (1967) concept of the open-ended hierarchy of awareness is suggested as a theoretical solution to the problem of homeostasis ((4) above) in systems of action. Argument for the use of an open systems approach in general, and Buckley&#8217;s paradigm in particular, together with the proposed amendments of Buckley&#8217;s scheme is presented in Chapters I and II. The case study is presented in Chapters III-VIII. Chapter III is a review of the historical factors which provide the context for the study, while changes occurring in the nursing, medical and non-medical sub-systems are discussed in turn, in Chapters, IV, V and VI respectively. Chapter VII identifies four scenes of social encounter in the ward and discusses the process of interaction occurring in each. Chapter VIII is an epilogue which examines briefly the outcome of events mentioned in the earlier chapters. Chapter IX is a statement of the conclusions drawn from the case study. The value of Buckley&#8217;s paradigm in the construction of an extended case study is demonstrated and the importance of the concepts of &#8216;mapping&#8217; and &#8216;perpetuation&#8217; is highlighted because they permit explanation of macrosocial processes which remain fully within the social context and point to the importance of identifying the dramatisation of power in social encounters. The initial harnessing of action theory and systems theory concepts was found to be too limited. A theoretical solution is, therefore, proposed in Chapter X which is capable of explaining system elaboration in the two dimensions of &#8216;organisation&#8217; and &#8216;self&#8217;. The model takes into account the dialectic tensions existing between &#8216;self/organisation&#8217; and &#8216;stability/change&#8217;, and differentiates between evolutionary and revolutionary change, making explicit both the constitutive processes of interaction and the interplay of forces affecting the individual and social order.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of pistis and cognate words in the Apostolic Fathers</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Thomas Calum</field><field name="description">The Apostolic Fathers is the name given to the body of literature, written in Greek, which dates from immediately after the New Testament period. The works cover the last decade of the 1st century AD, and the first half of the second century. They give a varied picture of the moral and doctrinal state of the early Christian Church in a period characterised by constant threat of persecution and martyrdom on the one hand, and growth in theological and ethical understanding on the other. The works considered in this thesis are the genuine letters of Ignatius; the Shepherd of Hermas; the Epistle of Barnabas and the Didache; the letter to Diognetus; the Clementine Homily (commonly called II Clement); the letters of Polycarp to the Philippians and the Martyrdom of Polycarp. The study begins with an essay on the development of the language of faith. This traces the use of the pistis group from Homer to the New Testament, and shows how the Homeric and Classical Greek usages were taken by the Septuagint and applied in a religious context to God and salvation, and how this process was further developed in the New Testament into a full-blown technical vocabulary of faith. The Apostolic Fathers take this process a step further, and there is a broadening of the meanings of the cognates, together with resultant changes in the linguistic usage. All the occurrences of pistis and its cognates in the Apostolic Fathers are examined in detail. In each case there is comment of the meaning of the words within the wider context in which they are set in each work. The Greek is given, together with a translation, and obscure passages are elucidated.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420107 Greek</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Cucurbita pepo and Cucurbita maxima to ethrel</field><field name="creator">Hume, Robert James</field><field name="description">Many commercial crops of Cucurbita maxima and C. pepo are grown from Fl hybrid seed in New Zealand.

Applying Ethrel sprays at 300ppm at the two and four leaf stage to the seed bearing parent delayed male flowering for sufficient time to allow insect pollination and eliminate 90% of the labour previously needed. After field trials the technique was used on a commercial scale. A satisfactory yield of pure Fl seed with a high germination percentage was produced. The variation between cultivars in response to Ethrel means that each one must be tested. It is shown that the degree and type of epinasty of pot plants sprayed with Ethrel can be used to determine the appropriate concentrations for field trials of C. pepo. The increase in female flower numbers, the shift in position of these flowers on the mainstem and the suppression of male flower numbers is brought about by two mechanisms. Ethrel sprays caused male flower bud abortion and an increase in the number of female flowers developing. More than one flower bud is borne in each leaf axil and if male, the bud aborts and can be replaced by a subsidiary undifferentiated bud which develops as a female. At the two to four leaf stage of plant development and shortly afterwards a large number of flower buds are developing to the stage of sexual differentiation. Spraying with Ethrel at these time is very effective in influencing sex expression. The release of ethylene by Ethrel breakdown continues for several days and the continuous exposure to ethylene is another reason for Ethrel&#8217;s effectiveness. The time course of ethylene release from aqueous Ethrel solutions was determined in some physical systems as well as from cotyledon and leaf surface contact. Some ethylene was released when Ethrel was applied to soil. When Ethrel was dried on surfaces or in soil its breakdown was much reduced, but on rewetting proceeded again. Spraying only one leaf with Ethrel still caused responses from other parts of the plant indicating transmission of a stimulus. This was not caused by aerial diffusion from the sprayed leaf. Although several effects of ethylene were studied major emphasis was placed on epinasty, stimulation of endogenous ethylene and its distribution between plant parts, the abortion of male flowers and the induction of female flowers. When aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) was applied with Ethrel, the plants show epinastic responses and male flower abortion but not female flower induction, endogenous ethylene production or transfer of stimuli of Ethrel effects within the plant. Ethylene gas was similarly ineffective on plants treated with AVG. Ethylenebiodynthesis is blocked at the stage producing aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) the immediate precursor of ethylene. Assays showed ACC to be below detectable levels in AVG treated plants. Ethrel alone caused high levels of ACC and ACC was found in high levels in plant apices if leaf one was sprayed with Ethrel. ACC is mobile in plants and a firm correlation is shown between female flower bud production and the presence of ACC. It was concluded the ethylene released from Ethrel sprays caused epinasty and male flower bud abortion as well as promoting endogenous ethylene production via ACC. Ethrel sprays release ethylene in sufficient quantity for long enough for very high levels of ACC to be produced and ACC is transported throughout the plant, but preferentially to metabolic sinks, e.g. the plant apices, where embryonic buds respond by developing as female flower buds. Increased ethylene levels were also recorded at these sites. Because ACC has been shown to cause a plant response formerly attributed to ethylene it is now essential to investigate the whole spectrum of &#8216;ethylene&#8217; effects in plants.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the reduction of formaldehyde emission from particleboard by polymers</field><field name="creator">Kazakevics, Arnis Aris Rolands.</field><field name="description">Formaldehyde is an important industrial chemical due to its unique properties, coupled with its low cost and the basic availability of the raw materials from which it is produced. It is generated principally by the catalytic oxidation of methanol using a heated stationary catalyst at approximately atmospheric pressure. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, the most significant of which in New Zealand, are the urea-formaldehyde resins. Such resins are used in the production of reconstituted wood products such as: particleboard; medium density fibreboard; plywood; laminated and finger jointed wood products; and in the modification of textiles and papers. Insulating building foams have also been formulated using urea-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde release from products containing urea-formaldehyde adhesives has been well documented in the literature over recent years. It has been shown that in some instances the levels of airborne formaldehyde inside dwellings and commercial premises may exceed various industrial threshold limit values for an eight hour working day. In New Zealand the current industrial permissible time weighted average value for formaldehyde in air is set at a maximum level of 2 ppm (2.4 mg of formaldehyde per metre3 of air). Natural levels of formaldehyde in air do exist and have been measured as being in the vicinity of 0.12 to 0.39 parts per billion. In terms of being a health hazard, formaldehyde was found to be a primary irritant of the respiratory airways and a skin sensitizer in some individuals. Some suggestion has been made that formaldehyde can also be carcinogenic. This suggestion should be treated with caution as it derives from preliminary experiments on rats and mice exposed to very high formaldehyde levels. Over the years a variety of test methods have been applied to the measurement of formaldehyde which is released from formaldehyde-bearing materials. A dynamic testing method, in the form of a wind-tunnel was adopted in this study for measuring the emission rate of formaldehyde directly from the surfaces of urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard. Emissions were quantified in terms of the weight of formaldehyde emitted in mg from one square metre of panel surface over one hour, under the prevailing climatic conditions. It was observed that formaldehyde emissions were as great as about 12 mg h-1 m-2 from panels tested soon after manufacture. After five years of storage of the particleboard panels in ventilated conditions, the formaldehyde emission rates were measured as being between 0.1 and 1.1 mg h-1 m-2. It was apparent that formaldehyde emissions from particleboard bonded with a urea-formaldehyde resin with a urea to formaldehyde molar ratio of 1 to 1.5, reached a basal level approximately 12 months from the time of manufacture. The formaldehyde emitted over the initial 12 month period was equated to the formaldehyde which was originally present dissolved in the resin solution and the formaldehyde which was cleaved from the urea-formaldehyde polymer network during high temperature pressing. Formaldehyde lost from the particleboard after the initial 12 month storage phase was probably due to hydrolysis of the resin under ambient conditions. The latter was termed "evaporable" formaldehyde as opposed to "free" formaldehyde which was emitted in the first 12 month period. The fluctuations in the basal emission rates of formaldehyde from particleboard were attributed to changes in the microclimate associated with the particleboard. Particleboard panels with a higher density surface layer of wood tended to have higher formaldehyde emission rates in the early period of storage compared with particleboard having a lower density of wood in the surface layer. Emissions of formaldehyde from the edges of freshly sawn particleboard tended to be as much as 30 to 60 times greater than emissions from the faces of the original panels. After extended storage, emissions from the edges of particleboard tended to approximate the levels of emissions from the faces of particleboard. It was demonstrated that the presence of an air boundary layer adjacent to the particleboard surface has a significant effect on the formaldehyde emission rate from the panel surface. Below air speeds of 5 cm s-1 over the panel surface, it appeared that the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde through the air boundary layer controlled the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde from the particleboard surface into the bulk air. At air velocities in excess of 5 am s-1 the effect of the air boundary layer diminished. It was estimated that within enclosed spaces, such as houses with a relatively low air-turnover rate, the diffusive resistance of air boundary layers to formaldehyde emissions from particleboard surfaces could be significant in lowering the formaldehyde levels inside the house. The use of paints, paint-coated wallpaper and polymer-coated wallpaper to cover particleboard surfaces tended to reduce the emission rate of formaldehyde to below the detection threshold of the method of measurement (0.01 mg h-1 m-2). Some building materials other than urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard were shown to emit measureable quantities of formaldehyde. These materials were of cellulosic-origin and emitted as much as 0.3 mg of formaldehyde h-1 m-2. The latter were known to not contain urea-fonnal6ehyde bonding agents. The levels of formaldehyde inside a showhome containing urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard as wall and floor cladding were measured as ranging from 1.2 to 7.2 mg m-3, but these air-borne concentrations of formaldehyde decreased to between 0.7 and 1.3 mg m-3. after an interval of three months. A mathematical model was derived for the prediction of the maximum expected steady state levels of formaldehyde inside dwellings containing formaldehyde-emitting materials. The model took into account such parameters as: the emission rate of formaldehyde from the emitting surface; the surface area of the exposed emitting material; and the volumetric air flow rate through the dwelling. The model in general tended to indicate higher formaldehyde levels when tested using the parameters derived from measurements taken in the showhome. This model could conceivably find use in the design of buildings in order to minimize the levels of formaldehyde in the indoor environment. The lack of sufficient information in the literature relating to the mass transfer of formaldehyde through polymers prompted the investigation into the permeability characteristics of polymeric materials to formaldehyde. The steady state transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polymer films, such as plastic films, free paint and free polyurethane varnish coatings, were measured using a diffusion cell operated at atmospheric pressure. The mass diffusion principle associated with this permeation testing device best paralleled the real-life situation where either polymer films (plastic films) or polymer coatings (paint or varnish coatings) may be in contact with formaldehyde and water vapour, at atmospheric pressure. As a source of penetrant in these studies a dilute aqueous solution of formaldehyde was used to yield molecular formaldehyde. It was calculated that an aqueous solution containing 69 mg L-1 of formaldehyde gave rise to a concentration in air of formaldehyde, above the solution, of 1 mg m-3 at 30&#176;C. A solution with such a concentration of dissolved formaldehyde was chosen arbitrarily for permeation studies. Levels of air-borne formaldehyde inside enclosed airspaces such as in houses lined with urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard, with a low air turn-over, could reasonably be expected to be in the region of 0.1 to 100 mg m-3. The use of carbon-14 formaldehyde was favoured in this research over the use of carbon-12 formaldehyde. This gave rise to the possibility of permeability isotope effects. Based on the information presented in this thesis and on the experimental variability in test results, it appeared that the effects of a permeability isotope effect were negligible in comparison. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the following types of polymer films were measured: low density polyethylene; high density polyethylene; high density-low density polyethylene blended polymer; polypropylene; poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); poly(viny1idene dichloride)-coated Poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); "Paraform", a multi-layered food packaging polymer film based on cellophane; Poly(ethylene vinyl acetate), a multi-layered food packaging polymer film; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; nylon-6; and cellophane. At 30&#176;C transmission rates of formaldehyde ranged from 1.2 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for cellophane to 1.2 x 10-l2 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) polymer films, respectively. There was some indication that the transmission rate of formaldehyde through low density polyethylene decreased with increasing film thickness. It also appeared that an increase in the water contents of nylon-6 and cellophane films lead to an increase in the transmission rate of formaldehyde. With the exception of the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of polymer films and the polystyrene film, all other polymer film types exhibited typical Fickian behaviour, in that the permeation of formaldehyde through each polymer film was steady state. The permeation of formaldehyde through poly (ethylene terephtha1ate)-type films and polystyrene film appeared to be anomalous in that the mass transfer process did not appear to show Fickian-type behaviour. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films, free vinyl-based paint films and through free polyurethane varnish films, were measured at 30&#176;C. The permeation of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films and free polyurethane varnish films typified Fickian behaviour, in that after a short time-lag the steady state permeation of formaldehyde occurred. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the free alkyd-types of paint film ranged from 1.8 x 10-9 &#956;g cm-1s-1 to 3 2 x l0-9 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 whereas transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polyurethane varnish films ranged from 4.1 x 10-10 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 2.4 x 10-8 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. It appeared that the "two-pack" or "catalytic-curing" type of polyurethane varnish film had a lower permeability to formaldehyde compared with either "one-pack" ("air-curing") or "one-pack" ("moisture-curing") varieties of polyurethane varnish. By contrast the transmission rates of formaldehyde through the vinyl-based types of paint films tended to range from 3.7 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 6.2 x10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. A study of the temperature dependency of the permeation of formaldehyde through the following polymer film types was made: low density polyethylene; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; polypropylene; high density polyethylene; cellophane; and nylon-6. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through each of these polymer film types increased with increasing temperature, over the temperature range of 30&#176;C to 50&#176;C, thus typifying Arrhenius behaviour. The energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde were calculated as ranging from 16 1 kcal mol-1 (67.4 kJ mol-1) for plasticised poly (vinyl chloride) to 33.1 kcal mol-1 (139 kJ mol-1 for cellophane, respectively. These activation energies were in general higher than the energies of activation for the permeation of other penetrants of similar molecular weight, through the same polymer types. The observed energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde through polymers were indicative of a strong interaction between formaldehyde and the various polymers. Desorption studies of formaldehyde from polymer films tested after permeability measurement, indicated that formaldehyde was irreversibly sorbed either onto or into the following polymer film types: low density polyethylene; poly(ethy1ene vinyl acetate); polypropylene; polystyrene; and plasticised poly(vinyl chloride). Formaldehyde was found to desorb from nylon-6 and cellophane polymer film types, indicating a different type of interaction between formaldehyde and these two polymer film types. The autoradiography of polymer films and free polymer coatings following permeability testing showed that the pattern of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde exhibited by each polymer film type or free polymer coating type, differed according to the type of polymer. Clustering of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde in polymer films containing polyethylene polymers may have been indicative of the formation of formaldehyde-formaldehyde polymers or perhaps could have been due to preferred pathways or sites for the diffusion of formaldehyde through the polymer film. The following types of polymer film tended to show a uniform sorption pattern of formaldehyde: nylon-6; cellophane; "Paraform"; free alkyd paint films; free vinyl-based paint films; and free polyurethane varnish films. The uniform appearance of the sorption pattern of carbon-14 formaldehyde may have been indicative of a higher solubility coefficient of permeation for formaldehyde in the latter polymer types. On the other hand, insufficient carbon-14 formaldehyde was sorbed by the poly(ethylene terephthalatel-type and polystyrene films in order to obtain autoradiographs. Both the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of films and the polystyrene film had a relatively low permeability to formaldehyde and appeared to also have a low solubilizing effect on formaldehyde. The data presented in this thesis are discussed in relation to the practical problem that initiated the study. Sufficient detailed information has been collected to enable informed decisions to be taken over the choice of formaldehyde-emitting materials used in the building and the food packaging industries.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independens long Vanuatu: the churches and politics in a Melanesian nation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Michael David</field><field name="description">In this dissertation I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in Vanuatu, focusing in particular on the role of the Christian churches in the independence movement of the 1970s. I also look at the political involvement of the churches in the two years immediately following national independence. The dissertation is based on fieldwork in Vanuatu from April 1981 to June 1982. In Chapter I, I introduce and defend my national, institutional perspective on the churches. In Chapter II, I discuss the history of Vanuatu, focusing specifically on the history of the missions up to the end of the 1960s. Chapter III looks at the independence movement and recent political history. In Chapter IV I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in two contrasting rural areas: at the Catholic mission station of Walarano, Malakula, and at the Presbyterian area of White Sands, Tanna. Chapter V is concerned with the ecumenical movement in the Pacific and looks at the support of the Pacific churches for the independence movement in Vanuatu. Chapters VI to X are parallel histories of the same period. They all look at the involvement of the churches in Vanuatu politics from about the beginning of the 1970s - when the independence movement began - up to national independence on 30 July 1980. However, each chapter is written from a different perspective. Chapter VI documents the political involvement of the Presbyterian Church; Chapter VII is concerned with Bishop Raweliffe and the politics of Anglicanism; Chapter VIII looks at the political role of the Roman Catholic Church in Vanuatu; Chapter IX focuses mostly on the relationship between the Churches of Christ and Nagriamel; and Chapter X takes a look at the ecumenical movement in Vanuatu and the origins and development of the New Hebrides Christian Council. In Chapter XI I examine the post-independence developments in all the major churches. Chapter XII concludes with a discussion of three issues: localisation, independence and unity, both in the churches and in the nation.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430103 History: Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation and utilisation of mucins by anaerobic bacteria from the colon</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Roger Anthony</field><field name="description">Intestinal mucins are high-molecular-weight complex glycoproteins which are thought to be fermented by the anaerobic bacteria in the colon. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the mode and extent of mucin degradation by bacteria. A method was developed to isolate gram quantities of soluble pig colonic mucin and pig gastric mucin. These preparations, along with commercially available pig gastric mucin, were incorporated into bacterial growth media as the sole carbohydrate energy sources. The molecular size and chemical composition of these mucins was determined before and after in vitro digestion by bacteria. Three different studies were done. In the first, type cultures of Bacteroides fragilis were found to be capable of growing on gastric and colonic mucins by cleaving residues from the non-reducing ends of the mucin oligosaccharide chains. Mucin degradation, however, was limited to the removal of only a few residues although this may be significant in vivo as bacteria in the gut lumen must be able to utilise many different complex polysaccharides and thus do not specialise in degrading any one substrate. In the second experiment, bacteria were isolated from the mucus layer of the pig colon. Three of the cultures studied extensively degraded mucins but colonic mucin was always more resistant to attack than the gastric mucins. Up to 80 mol% of the gastric mucin carbohydrates were cleaved and utilised. In contrast these bacteria utilised no more than 46 mol% of the colonic mucin carbohydrates. In the third study, fresh rat faecal material was used to inoculate bacterial media containing either colonic mucin or commercial gastric mucin. The faecal bacteria had completely degraded the gastric mucin after 24 h incubation but 36 h incubation was required to degrade the colonic mucin. However, when bacteria from the colonic mucin tubes were subcultured into fresh colonic mucin it was completely fermented after 24h incubation. It is hypothesis that, although the chemical compositions were similar, colonic mucin contained bonds that were not present in the gastric mucin. Evidence for this was obtained by assaying the mucins using the histochemical periodic acid/Schiff and Alcian blue stains. The Alcian blue reactivity was more conserved than PAS staining during bacterial hydrolysis. Therefore hydrolysis of these Alcian blue reactive groups may be the rate-limiting step in colonic mucin degradation. The molecular basis of the PAS and Alcian blue stains was investigated. PAS stain (0.01% periodic acid) was found to react with terminal neuraminic acid, fucose and possibly galactose residues but not with hexosamine residues. Alcian blue stain bound mainly to sulphate esters but could not be correlated with total sulphate content. When both these colorimetric Alcian blue and PAS stains were use together they provided a valuable tool for assaying the results of chromatography runs. Gastric mucin was show to be composed of separate neutral (Alcian blue negative) and acidic (Alcian blue positive) glycoproteins. Colonic mucin contained only acidic glycoproteins.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PulA, a thermostable pullulanase from an extreme thermophile Caldocellum saccharolyticum</field><field name="creator">Albertson, Gregory David</field><field name="description">The pullulanase gene from Caldocellum saccharolyticum, an obligate thermophilic anaerobe, was sequenced and expressed in E. coli. Expression and substrate induction studies in E. coli showed that while gene expression was substrate inducible and the enzyme was exported into the growth medium in C. saccharolyticum, expression was non-inducible in E. coli and the enzyme remained in the cytoplasm. The nucleotide sequence of the pulA gene was shown to be 2478 basepairs (bp) in length, coding for a protein of 96 kDa. The proposed promoter sequences showed homology to both the standard E. coli sequences and the consensus sequences obtained from other C. saccharolyticum genes. The enzyme from the native organism was purified from the growth medium and shown to have a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. Periodic acid-Schiffs staining showed that this enzyme was glycosylated and substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but hydrolysed amylopectin, amylose and &#946;-limit dextran to produce a number of smaller oligosaccharides. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli from its own promoters and was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction. Substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but had only limited activity on &#946;-limit dextran and amylopectin, and no activity on amylose. The pullulanase gene was also expressed under the control of a heat-inducible overexpression system in E. coli and a copper-inducible expression system in yeast. Amino acid homology comparisons of the pullulanase to other pullulanase sequences and related enzymes revealed a high degree of homology, particularly around three highly conserved regions. In &#945;-amylases amino acids in these regions are involved in catalytic activity, substrate binding and metal ion binding.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Credit, an analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s perennial third party</field><field name="creator">Miller, Raymond, 1953-</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to provide a history and political analysis of the organisation, policies, membership and leadership of the Social Credit party between 1953 and 1986. The introductory chapter describes the methodology and reviews the literature on third parties in general and Social Credit in particular. Chapter Two provides a prelude to the formation of the Social Credit Political League in 1953. It traces the movement's decline as an education and pressure group under the first Labour Government. Chapter Three examines the debate surrounding the decision t o engage in direct political action and describes the process by which the Political League was formed. Chapter Four considers the reasons for and the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary, Banking and Credit Systems (1956) and accounts for the growing internal debate culminating in the removal of Mr Wilfrid Owen as Leader in 1959. In Chapter Five the impact on the party of Mr Vernon Cracknell's victory in Hobson in 1966 is considered, along with an assessment of his role in Parliament as the sole third party representative. The reasons for his defeat at the 1969 general election and replacement as Leader some six months later are investigated, and Chapter Six is devoted to the brief but stormy experiment with Mr John O'Brien as Leader, followed by his split from the League in 1972 and the formation of the New Democrat Party. The early Beetham years, including attempts to revise the party's monetary reform dogma, broaden the scope of its message, and to give it a more professional organisation are considered in Chapter Seven. I n Chapter Eight the reasons for and the internal consequences of the party's rapid rise in popularity from early 1978 and its decline after March 1981 are analysed. The chapter ends with an account of Mr Beetham's defeat as Leader in 1986. The thesis concludes that Social Credit's history as an electoral organisation has been conspicuously cyclical, that its progress has been regulated largely by the electoral performances of the two major parties and by the presence or absence of minor party competition, that its leadership has been distinctly oligarchic, and that Social Credit has not been one, but several different parties. Why has the party not been more successful? And why has it lasted so long? These questions are addressed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating independent learning early in the first year of school</field><field name="creator">Watson, Barbara</field><field name="description">This is a study of a) the nature and incidence of independent learning defined as "knowing how to generate and direct the processes of learning...*(see p.3) in new entrant classroom settings and, b) the nature of the teacher-child interactions associated with such independent learning. Systematic observation was used at school entry and three months later, to identify aspects of independent learning and the associated teacher behaviours. Six categories of child directed acts identified the range of behaviours from which independent learning could be inferred. Each category of teacher behaviour that appeared to facilitate independent learning in children was developed as a "mirror image" of each category of child directed acts. The teacher and four children in two new entrant classes were observed over the whole day for five days during two observation periods, one at the beginning of Term three and the other after 12 weeks. Each class was involved in normal classroom activities that covered the whole curriculum. The children were engaging in a considerable amount of independent learning on entry to school and three months later. Many facilitative teaching acts occurred in the interactive style that was demonstrated in all aspects of the curriculum. The teachers spent a considerable portion of teaching time assisting children in one-to-one teaching situations and in small groups, encouraging their responses and fostering and supporting independence in their learning. There was some difference observed between teachers in the attention given to different categories and in the facilitative behaviour occurring in one-to-one interactions and small group teaching interactions. A way of teaching emerges that differs from a teaching agenda determined by didactic, traditional instruction. The two teachers were deemed to be using the children's agenda to foster and support them in independent learning in the various curriculum areas. Some of the practical and philosophical features of the New Zealand education system that may contribute to this particular style of teaching are discussed. The theories of learning and teaching deriving from this study place a value on independent learning (as here defined) in new entrant children and on the teacher&#8217;s role in providing opportunities for it to develop. Independent learning a) ensures the continuation of learning at times when the teacher is directly engaged with other children, and b) derives from a teacher expectation that children will be able to actively process ideas and make some decisions about their learning. It engenders a power in children that sustains the momentum of learning.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Skuse) (Diptera : Lycetophilidae) in tourist caves at Waitomo</field><field name="creator">Pugsley, Chris, 1953-</field><field name="description">The New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) provides the national tourist industry with a unique attraction. The Glowworm Cave at Waitomo has an international reputation for the bioluminescent display produced by A. luminosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate glowworm ecology in the tourist caves at Waitomo, the results to provide factual information so that scientifically sound management procedures could be devised to ensure the long term survival of the population. The literature on all aspects of A. luminosa is reviewed. A continuous cycle of development occurs with most stages present throughout the year. However, the majority of the larval population pupates in late winter/early spring, producing a new generation in spring/early summer. There are five larval instars; the time for individual development in the Glowworm Cave varies considerably but is estimated to take 5 months on average. Distribution of glowworms is dependent on an adequate food supply, cool, moist climate and a suitable horizontal rock surface. Their diet consists of chironomids with some tipulids, ephemeropterans and trichopterans, most of which emerge inside the cave. Factors likely to influence distribution and productivity of benthic fauna in the cave are reviewed, including the importance of flooding and stream drift fauna in restocking the cave. Mortality is caused by two species of opiliones, cannibalism and a fungal pathogen identified as Tolypocladium sp. (Moniliales). Preliminary experiments with Tolypocladium indicate that the higher temperatures of the Glowworm Cave may be responsible for the prevalence of the fungus compared with non-tourist caves in the district. Observations on cave climate showed that the Glowworm Cave now has a higher range of temperature and relative humidity compared with earlier records and non-tourist caves at Waitomo. This is attributed in part to the free flow of air that occurs between the two entrances of the cave and the outside atmosphere. Reasons for the decline in the glowworm display that has occurred in the past few years are discussed. The installation of an open grille on the Top Entrance of the Glowworm Cave in 1975 is suggested as one of the main factors responsible. Future research projects are mentioned, together with recommendations for cave management related to glowworm ecology.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utilisation of cyclopropyl compounds in the synthesis of troponoids</field><field name="creator">Gravatt, Gary Lance</field><field name="description">The fully regio-controlled synthesis of C1a-C12a mono-seco colchicine 133, as well as a number of structurally interesting analogues, has been achieved.

Chromosome numbers for the following taxa are confirmed: P. kumeraho A. Cunn. 2n = 24, P. aspera Sieber (cultivated) 2n = 24, P. phylici-folia Lodd. 2n = 48, P. rugosa Cheeseman 2n = 48, P. erici-folia Hook. 2n = 36, P. hamiltonii L.B. Moore 2n = 36, P. edgerleyi Hook. 2n = 37, P. novae-zelandiae stat.nov. 2n = 36. In P. kumeraho, breeding experiments, and studies of the ovule show that plants are self fertile, and reproduction is sexual. Microsporogenesis studies show some asyndesis, and the presence of fragments of unexplained origin at meiosis. Half the microspores formed are inviable. The triploid taxa reproduce by agamospermy. The origin of the embryo sac is diplosporous. Although breeding experiments indicate that pollination improves seed set, endosperm chromosome counts in P. hamiltonii show that fertilisation of the endosperm nucleus does not occur. A physiological stimulatory effect from pollination is postulated. At microsporogenesis in the triploid taxa, some restitution occurs at the first meiotic division with the formation of large unreduced pollen grains. The rate of restitution is variable and is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Restitution is correlated with high univalent frequency, and restituting cells exhibit little Anaphase I movement of chromosomes. Pollen of triploids is highly variable in size, pore number, and viability. P. phylicifolia shows mostly bivalents at meiosis, producing 25-30% viable pollen with reduced chromosome number. Reproduction is mainly sexual, but there is some indication that agamospermy may also occur. P. rugosa shows a high proportion of multivalents at meiosis, and segregation is irregular. Viable pollen with a reduced chromosome number is below 5%. Restitution may occur at meiosis under certain conditions. Reproduction is presumed to be agamospermous. The comparative morphology of the New Zealand and Australian taxa of Pomaderris was also studied from herbarium specimens. The data were analysed using numerical taxonomic methods. Four clusters of O.T.U.s are identified, but many O.T.U.s are intermediate in morphology and do not belong to a cluster. The New Zealand taxa are spread among the four clusters. Each N.Z. taxon is closer to an Australian taxon than to other N.Z. taxa. Pollen of Australian specimens was compared with pollen of known N.Z. polyploids. The existence of polyploids and apomicts among the Australian taxa is suggested. Taxonomy and origin of the New Zealand polyploid taxa are discussed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour mobility and economic transformation in Solomon Islands: lusim Choiseul, bae kam baek moa?</field><field name="creator">Friesen, Wardlow.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship of labour mobility and socioeconomic transformation in the Solomon Islands, and proposes that one cannot be understood in isolation from the other. Explanation is pursued both at the levels of structure and of agency, and integration of these levels is attempted in some places. This is discussed in the first part of the thesis, within a general discussion of issues of theory and method. The second part of the thesis deals with the structural parameters of labour mobility. Through the twentieth century, the institutions of government, mission and capitalist enterprise have been central in shaping the Solomon Islands social formation. The roles of these formal institutions with implications for labour mobility have ranged from purveyors of ideology to employers of labour. Another major element in the social formation is an original Melanesian mode of production which influences labour mobility through village-level institutions such as the land tenure system, kinship, and household operation. Labour circulation is a major factor in linking village and non-village institutions, and more abstractly in articulating two different modes of production. The third part of the thesis considers the ways in which individual agency operates within structure. The data base are life histories and related information from the Mbambatana language group on the island of Choiseul. This is integrated with national, regional and village-level structural information. Education is important in the way it 'selects' individuals for certain kinds of employment. This selection process occurs within the wage economy generally, but is further refined within institutions of employment. This results in labour mobility 'streams' which have identifiable characteristics related to gender, education, and employment type. Movements within each 'stream' have typical temporal and spatial characteristics. Patterns of labour mobility, especially sequence, are affected by gender and life cycle factors. For men and women the most critical changes take place in the 20s age span, but individual behaviour varies according to marriage and childrearing patterns. From a village perspective, labour circulation is a logical response to the necessity of operating within two different economic systems typified by different modes of production. This process of articulation is manifest in other ways as well, and households or families may adopt different strategies in operating within two different systems. The particular strategy adopted depends on the labour power available, degree of access to land, and employment possibilities of individual members.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure of reovirus</field><field name="creator">Metcalf, Peter</field><field name="description">The arrangement of the capsomers comprising the outer shell or capsid of reovirus has been determined by the computer modeling of images of reovirus replicas prepared by freeze-etching techniques. An optical low-pass spatial filter was used to improve the visibility of the virus images and two types of capsid subunit could then be seen which were termed ring and pentamer-crater capsomers. Sufficient of them could be identified on reovirus particles to make the computer modeling of the particle possible. The capsid was shown by these methods to have T=13,1 triangulated icosahedral symmetry. It is comprised of 60 ring capsomers and 12 pentamer craters surrounded by another 60 incomplete ring capsomers. The same T=13,1 symmetry was found for the single-shelled particles of the two rotaviruses, SA-11 and NCDV, which have 132 uniform capsomers. However, fragments of reovirus capsids, such as are sometimes seen in negatively stained reovirus preparations, were found which had non-T=13,1 symmetry, presumably as a result of capsomer rearrangement. The dimensions of a large number of the triangular subunits of these capsid fragments were measured and it was shown that triangles originating from different parts of the reovirus capsid had non-identical lengths. The lengths found were consistent with the T=13,1 model proposed for the virus. Conditions favouring the formation of crystalline aggregates of reovirus core particles have been found. The unit cell geometry of the two classes of crystals obtained was determined.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A structural investigation of some light atom molecules</field><field name="creator">Buckleton, John</field><field name="description">A series of structures of light atom molecules is presented. The molecules, in the main, are physiologically active or potentially active. The molecules have been divided into five broad categories. Their structure and properties are discussed. Section 1 presents some organic natural products largely isolated during the chemotaxonomic investigation of coastal marine organisms from New Zealand and Australian waters including the first porphyrin isolated from a sponge. Also presented are the structures of an isostegane and an intermediate in the synthesis of potentially odoriferous compounds. Section 2 presents compounds related to the drug amsacrine m-AMSA, of known chemotherapeutic use and other compounds produced in the study of chemotherapeutic agents, some as templates for elaboration into bis- and tris- intercalators. Section 3 presents anthraquinone derivatives related to the synthesis of compounds of known chemotherapeutic activity. One of these is a stable ozonide. Section 4 presents the study of 4, 4'-bipyridinium cations, compounds related to paraquat and exhibiting interesting electrical properties. Section 5 presents two compounds related to the study of colchicine, the most commonly used drug in the treatment of gout and a compound of other biological interest.

It is therefore important to gain an understanding of the reactivity of these functional groups. The metal-carbon double bond is introduced in Chapter 1 with a literature review and the following two chapters are concerned with the synthesis and properties of a new class of Group VIII metal carbene complexes containing the prototype carbene ligand, =CH2. The synthetic route to the first of these complexes involves a new low-valent osmium complex OsCl(NO) (PPh3)3. The synthesis of this complex from a reformulated complex containing the novel peroxycarbonyl ligand is discussed in Chapter 2, followed by simple reactions including the synthesis of a range of acetylene, allene and heteroallene &#960;-adducts. The reactions establish that OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 reacts as the osmium analogue of IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2. The methylene-ligand synthesis involves the addition of diazomethane to OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 to give the structurally characterised Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. The reaction has been extended to give the first isolable ruthenium and iridium methylene complexes. The reactions of these complexes establish the nucleophilicity of the double bond and two Lewis acid adducts, Os(CH2AuI)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2 and [Os(CH2S(O)O)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2]ClO4, have been structurally characterised. The reaction with CO and isocyanides to form ketene and ketenimine ligands illustrates a different mode of reaction that is interpreted in terms of the non-innocent participation of the nitrosyl ligand. The change from nucleophilicity to electrophilicity of the double bond with a reduction of metal electron density is illustrated by reactions of Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(pph3)2 which implicate [OS(CH2)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2]+ as an intermediate. Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2 is formed by addition of Cl2 to Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. In Chapter 4 a different type of metal-carbon double bond is discussed. The complexes contain the relatively uncommon dichlorocarbene ligand and the synthesis of the first such iridium complex, Ir(CCl2)Cl3(PPh3)2 is described. The utility of the dichlorocarbene ligand in the synthesis of a range of carbene ligands including monochlorocarbene complexes is illustrated. The most useful single reaction of the dichlorocarbene complexes is that forming a metal-carbon triple bond. A review of the literature concerning carbyne complexes is presented in Chapter 5 and the synthesis and reactions of a number of carbyne complexes is discussed in Chapter 6. Like the methylene complexes, the carbyne complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 contain nucleophilic metal-carbon bonds and Os(CHPh)Cl2(CO)(PPh3)2 resulting from HCl addition has been structurally characterised. However, just as the reactivity can be changed with the methylene complexes, the reduction of metal electron density in complexes such as [Os(CR)Cl2 (CNR')(PPh3)2]ClO4 (R = C6H4-4-NMe2, R' = C6H4-4-Me) makes the triple bond electrophilic. Two methods for synthesising these octahedral carbyne complexes are described. One, involving a reaction of complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with oxygen and the formation of another peroxycarbonyl ligand, the other a reaction with iodine to give complexes such as Ru(CPh)ClI2(PPh3)2. Reactions with chlorine by contrast lead to a group of reactive chlorophenyl carbene complexes. Where appropriate, the reactivity of the complexes described is interpreted in terms of frontier-orbital and charge controlled reactions using the current models for the carbene and carbyne complexes.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The calculation of cloud parameters from AVHRR data</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Roy Gordon</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the electromagnetic radiation that is reflected from and emitted by a clear or cloudy terrestrial atmosphere. Calculations are performed in order to estimate the radiation exitant to space in the visible, the near visible, and the two infrared windows at approximately 4 &#956;m and 11 &#956;m. The NOAA-9 satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/2) is used as the data acquisition system. The satellite AVHRR system is described, as well as future TIROSN satellites. The pre-launch calibration of the radiometer is described in some detail. Post-launch calibration is examined using a reflectance difference method. The radiometer gains are shown to have changed by more than 20% from their pre-launch values. A LOWTRAN based atmospheric model suitable for New Zealand is developed to provide cloud free transmission values. Atmospheric scattering is shown to contribute negligibly to visible cloud measurements (for 8-bit radiometer resolution). The Channels 1 to 3 terrestrial reflectance is averaged from more than two years of satellite data. Sea-surface state is examined as a function of windspeed. A method of extracting surface temperature in rugged terrain is developed. Dual temperature measurements at 10.8 and 11.8 &#956;m are used to estimate surface air temperature. The transfer of radiation in a single layer cloud is calculated as a function of cloud thickness, observation/illumination geometry and the effective radius of the cloud drop-distribution. The variation in drop-size is contained in an ensemble of modified-Gamma distributions whose effective radius varies from 1 to 30 &#956;m with a fixed dispersion of 0.25. A technique is established which allows effective cloud radius to be estimated from 3.7 &#956;m AVHRR/2 imagery. The radiation values at 0.65 &#956;m and 11.8 &#956;m are used to correct the 3.7 &#956;m reflectance for variation in cloud thickness and temperature respectively. The procedure is limited to warm clouds of moderate optical depth. In addition, the inversion process generates values of cloud top height and temperature, cloud depth and column liquid water content. The method is used to observe the development of orographic cloud formed over the southern half of the North Island of New Zealand. The inversion results for this type of cloud are in agreement with aircraft measurements carried out by the New Zealand Meteorological Service and are well fitted by a simple drop-growth model.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the magellanic clouds and other southern objects at TeV energies</field><field name="creator">Bond, Ian Anthony</field><field name="description">The results of observational studies of very high energy (VHE) and ultra high energy (UHE) gamma ray emission, by various astrophysical objects, made from 1988 to 1990 with the JANZOS Cerenkov facility are presented. The active galaxy Cen A and the Galactic X-ray binary systems Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and Cir X-1 were monitored for VHE gamma ray emission above 1 TeV. No evidence was found for persistent or episodic emission from any of these objects. Upper limits on the VHE fluxes above 1 TeV of 2.1&#215;10-11, 2.7&#215;10-11, 3.6&#215;10-11 and 3.5&#215;10-11 cm-2 s-1 respectively were obtained for these objects. These limits are consistent with previous observations made by other groups. Various objects in the Magellanic Clouds were monitored for UHE gamma ray emission using the Cerenkov technique at large zenith angles. This technique has been found to be more sensitive at UHE energies -100 TeV than the conventional air shower technique. During 1990 the equipment was modified to allow a sky coverage of 7&#176;&#215;23&#176; at large zenith angles. This enabled most of the extent of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be surveyed at UHE energies. An examination of the UHE database yielded no evidence for persistent emission from SN1987A and selected X-ray pulsars in the Magellanic Clouds. Upper limits on the UHE fluxes (in cm-2s-1) above the given threshold energies were obtained as follows: SMC X-1, 2.4&#215;10-13 (&gt;30 TeV); SN1987A, 2.3&#215;10-13 (&gt;65 TeV); PSR0540-693, 2.3&#215;10-13(&gt;65 TeV); LMC Trans, 1.5&#215;10-13(&gt;130 TeV); LMC X-4, 1.3&#215;l0-l3 (&gt;140 TeV). Evidence was found for two episodes of pulsed gamma ray emission above 65 TeV from SN1987A. On the nights of May 28 and June 23, 1990, a periodicity search using the Rayleigh test showed significant power at 18.356 ms. This is near a periodicity reported at optical wavelengths in September, 1990. The chance probability for the individual period was about 10-6 on each of the two nights. Excess events of the order of 1&#963; were also seen on these nights. The overall chance probability, allowing for all degrees of freedom, was found to be 0.1%. Evidence was also found for a single episode of gamma ray emission above 140 TeV from LMC X-4 on May 27, 1990. Excess events were seen with a statistical significance of 2.4 &#963;. A periodicity test showed maximum Rayleigh power at 13.488 s on this night. The chance probability for the individual period was 8&#215;10-3 and the overall chance probability was found to be 0.5%.

It is believed that they formed in a northward-dipping subduction zone, beneath a Palaeogene arc system now accreted along the north coast of New Guinea, and that they now lie within a Tertiary continent-arc collision zone. The South Sepik blueschists, or Tau Blueschist, are situated near the centre of New Guinea, on the northern fall of the island's axial mountains, and are mostly contained in an allochthonous east-west lens (55 x 8 km) known as the Tau body. There are also some much smaller allochthons to the east of the Tau body. The blueschists occur within the late-Mesozoic to Eocene Salumei Formation, which is believed to be a tectonic mixture of mostly politic sediments, derived from the continent to the south, and ophiolite fragments and other volcanogenic rocks, related to the arc to the north. Near the Tau body, the Salumei Formation is metamorphosed from prehnite-pumpellyite to low-greenschist grade. Stratigraphic constraints and isotopic dating indicate an Oligocene to early Miocene metamorphism of the Tau Blueschist, Salumei Formation, and other metamorphic rocks in the region. The blueschists are mostly massive to well-foliated mafic schists, containing abundant blue amphibole, but there are also some intimately associated pelitic-calcareous-graphitic metasediments. Within the Tau body the metamorphic grade increases towards the north, from lawsonite rocks to high-grade epidote blueschists. The lowest grade blueschists are pumpellyitic lawsonitic metabasites, known only from river float. In addition, there are zones and isolated occurrences of coarsely crystalline mafic tectonic blocks, within and just north of the Tau body. These include high-grade blueschist, eclogite and amphibolite. There is a complete spectrum from blueschist to eclogite. Whole-rock chemistry indicates, that all basic rocks are probably metamorphosed mafic ophiolite. The mineralogy and mineral chemistry is similar to other circum-Pacific blueschists, particularly those in New Caledonia. The blue amphibole is glaucophane or crossite, but ferroglaucophane occurs in the lawsonite zone. It is sometimes accompanied by Ca-amphibole, ranging from actinolite, in the lawsonite zone, to barroisite, in the epidote zone. Some metabasites and metasediments contain grossularitic almandine garnet, spessartine rich at low grade to pyropic at high grade. Sodic pyroxene is not particularly common in the blueschists, and is generally an acmitic variety, although omphacite occurs in eclogites. Paragonite is common in the epidote zone, often associated with phengite, while chlorite and albite are present at all grades, generally in small amounts. Calcite, dolomite and chloritoid occur in metasediments of the epidote zone. The unique assemblage lawsonite-glaucophane-chloritoid was found. Apart from zoning in minerals, and minor retrograde alteration, most rocks appear to be equilibrium assemblages, and obey the phase rule. The conditions of metamorphism are estimated from available experimental studies, and calculations based on mineral thermodynamic data. Equilibria involving lawsonite, epidote, grossular, albite, paragonite and quartz suggest 395&#176;C and 7.5 kbar at the disappearance of lawsonite. Metasediments in the middle of the epidote zone yield a minimum of 420&#176;C from the calcite-dolomite geothermometer, and 444&#176; &#177; 20&#176;C from coexistence of chloritoid, garnet, albite paragonite and quartz. A pressure of 10-11 kbar at 500&#176;C is calculated from garnet, epidote, albite, paragonite and quartz in the highest grade blueschists. Corrections to the muscovite-paragonite solvus for pressure and non-binary components give plausible temperatures and pressures for coexisting white micas. Mineral stabilities, and equilibria between paragonite, jadeite, albite, grossular and zoisite, indicate a maximum of 550&#176;C and 15 kbar for eclogites, and that current versions of the garnet-clinopyroxene thermometer are not giving accurate results in eclogites with high jadeite or acmite in the pyroxene. From buffer equilibria between calcite and Ca-Al silicates in metasediments, the non-ideal mole fraction of CO2 is estimated to be about 0.02 in the epidote zone, and 0.002 in the lawsonite zone. Graphite, pyrite and pyrrhotite in metasediments allow calculation of fluid composition in the system C-H-O-S, and show that very minor CH and H2S were present. Water activities may have been high in some eclogites. The metamorphic conditions require that both blueschists and eclogites were formed in a subduction system, and support the continent-arc collision hypothesis. However, some form of active and rapid transport is needed to bring these rocks back to shallow levels, and the term "retrojection" is coined.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerobiology of the Auckland region in relation to allergic asthma and rhinitis</field><field name="creator">Hasnain, Syed Mohammed</field><field name="description">Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, with a population of approx. 700,000, is notorius for its high incidence of respiratory allergies, particularly asthma. At a conservative estimate, one in every ten persons in the region suffers from allergic asthma and/or rhinitis (hay fever). In the Auckland Hospital Board area alone, there were 58 deaths from asthma in 1979 and 57 in 1980 (an average of 5 per month). Asthma and rhinitis affect people of all ages. To investigate the reason for the high incidence of these respiratory allergies, an aerobiological study of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the air spora was thus undertaken. To include a reasonably representative cross section of the region for air sampling three localities from near the centre of the city to the western suburban fringe were chosen along a 20km axis encompassing commercial, residential, agricultural, horticultural and forested environments. A Burkard 7-day recording volumetric spore trap was operated continuously at each locality, from 1 September 1979 to 31 August 1980. Counting and identification of spores and pollen grains were undertaken within 5 random microscope fields along each of 12 traverses across the spore trap tapes representing alternate hours of the day on Mondays and Tuesdays. Data were converted to concentrations (numbers m-3 of air). Of a total of 38 spore or pollen categories recorded, 24 displayed seasonal and circadian periodicities. The survey revealed that there was considerable contamination of the atmosphere by spores of various fungi, particularly in summer and autumn with peaks at all sites in autumn. It is of interest that the admission rate of patients with "status asthmaticus" in the two year period January 1979 &#8211; December 1980, was also high in summer and autumn with peaks in both years in April (autumn). Fungal spores &gt;3&#956;m constituted c. 99% of the Auckland air spora in all seasons, even spring, the chief pollen season. Basidiospores were the most abundant type of the region. Amongst indentified basidiospores, Ganoderma and Coprinus predominated. Basidiospores ascribable to Hypholoma, "Calvatia-Bovista" Tilletiopsis, Entoloma and Thelephora were also recorded. Ascospores of various genera were also abundant at all sites. Among them, those ascribable to the genus Leptosphaeria were most common, followed by "Hypoxylon-Xylaria", Pleospora and Venturia. Conidia of Cladosporium were one of the principal components. Other conidia recorded, although in small numbers, belonged to the genera Polythrincium (trifolii), Epicoccum, Pithomyces (chartarum), Stemphylium, Alternaria, Periconia, Torula, Helicomyces, Helminthosporium (Drechslera), Pestalotia, Cryptostroma, Tetraploa, Arthrinium and Monilia. Conidia of "Aspergillus-Penicillium" type were the most prevalent at the city site. A comparison of the air spora at the three localities revealed major quantitative but not qualitative differences. The suburban locality emerged with higher spore concentrations than the urban and forested sites. The relationships between some meteorological factors and the 14 most prevalent categories of the air spora were analysed. Cladosporium and Polythrincium showed a significant correlation with temperature; unidentifiable ascospores were correlated with midnight temperature, humidity and, strongly, with rainfall; Leptosphaeria correlated with rainfall and midnight temperature. Unidentifiable coloured and hyaline basidiospores as well as Ganoderma and Coprinus were positively correlated with temperature. Coloured basidiospores and Ganoderma also showed a significant "negative" correlation with wind speed. On the basis of the aerobiological findings and a potential link with asthma admissions to hospital a total of 67 aqueous and lyophilized extracts from basidiomycetous fungi collected in the Auckland region were prepared in buffered saline, with W/V standardized concentration, for immunological studies. 'Total protein' content of the extracts were estimated. A total of 129 allergic patients both "heterogeneous group" and diagnosed, attending hospital allergy clinic, were tested by the skin prick method. Over 10% of the patients reacted positively to the crude extracts of the following fungi: Ganoderma mastoporum*, Ganoderma applanatum**, Scleroderma albidum*, Coprinus micaceus*, Lycoperdon compactum*, Hydnum crocidens var. badius**, Xeromphalina podocarpi***, Auricularia polytricha***, Agaricus bisporus*,Bovista brunnea*, Panaeolina foenisecii**, Hypholoma acutum**, Calvatia* sp. Pseudohydnum gelatinosum***, Trametes versicolor***, Favolaschia calocera***, Cortinarius*, Tyromyces*** sp. and Hydnum crocidens**. Allergenicity to many of these genera has rarely been investigated or reported. The findings of the investigation suggest that fungal spores in general, and basidiospores in particular, may play an important role in the high incidence of allergic asthma and rhinitis in the Auckland region. * spores alone extracted ** hymenial tissue extracted *** whole sporophores extracted</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and function of invertebrate septate junctions</field><field name="creator">Green, Colin Richard</field><field name="description">The structure and function of septate junctions have been studied by ultrastructural techniques in a wide range of invertebrate phyla. Techniques have included conventional and tracer impregnated tissue thin sectioning, and freeze-fracture of both fixed and unfixed tissue. Standard and goniometer stage transmission electron microscopy has been used. Work in this study has been concentrated mainly on the lower invertebrate phyla in which the simplest forms of junction might be seen, and on the higher invertebrate phyla. This latter group is of special interest in the transition region between the invertebrate and vertebrate phyla. Six new types of septate junction and a form of tight junction have been found in invertebrate phyla and are described. Two of these new septate junctions occur in each of the phyla Coelenterata, Echinodermata and Hemichordata. The tight junction occurs in the phylum Tunicata. Further data has also been obtained on five of the six previously described types of septate junction. The distribution of all twelve types within the invertebrates and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed. Work with the goniometer stage has aided in interpreting junctional structures. The results have revealed several features of the septate junction that support the idea that it has a mainly occluding function analogous to that of the vertebrate tight junction. In addition, an anastomosing septate junction has been found in the Echinodermata which is postulated to be a structural intermediate between the invertebrate septate junction and the vertebrate tight junction. A hypothesis is proposed suggesting how the septate junction might have evolved into the vertebrate tight junction. Tricellular junctional regions of most of the septate junction types are noted and briefly described.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unemployment in New Zealand, 1981-1983: a study of the presentation by radio, television and the press of a major social problem</field><field name="creator">Leitch, Shirley R.</field><field name="description">In New Zealand there is a marked scarcity of material on the workings of the indigenous news media.

The neutral face of the news discourse is shown to conceal the routinized signification practices of journalistic professionalism. These practices act to separate the normative from the deviant.

The hybridoma has been shown to be susceptible to cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells and cytotoxic cells arising spontaneously in culture. From the original cloned hybridoma line, a number of variants have been isolated which grow as different types of tumours in syngeneic mice. One particular strain grows with high efficiency as tumours in the spleen. In contrast to the original hybridoma, the progressive spleen-seeking tumour cells appear to have lost their ability to stimulate the immune system. The contribution that natural killer cell and T cell immunity plays in controlling tumour growth has been demonstrated and the vitro analysis of immune effector cells in the spleen of mice challanged with tumour cells has been investigated. These data illustrate the advantages of using hybridoma cells as a model to investigate tumour immunity.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface analysis of particulate emissions before and after atmospheric aging</field><field name="creator">Henshaw, Geoffrey Stephen</field><field name="description">The reactions and transformations of atmospheric primary particles have been studied using the surface analysis techniques of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Particles emitted from a steel mill were studied at their point of emission, during transport through the atmosphere and after deposition. The mill was located in a coastal region removed from other major industrial particle sources which made the identification of the mill particulate emissions possible in ambient samples. The mill utilizes indigenous titanomagnetite ironsand and coal as the raw materials. There is evidence of the surface enrichment of volatile trace elements such as Zn, S, Na, K and P from the raw materials in the particulate emissions. Particle samples were collected from sites within the mill which represented different stages in the iron-making process, including the rotary kilns, electric melting furnaces and the vanadium recovery plant. This established an inventory of particulate emissions. Mill sourced particles were then identified and studied in air samples collected downwind of the mill on silver-coated nucleopore filters. AES and SIMS depth profiling studies indicated the mill particles became surface enriched in sea salt components such as S, predominately as sulfate, Cl- and Na+ after atmospheric aging. This was attributed to their coagulation with the marine derived ambient aerosol. SIMS ion imaging and mass spectral analysis suggested a characteristic "fingerprint" of the mill emissions could be distinguished in the ambient aerosol up to 8 km downwind of the mill. An experimental rig was constructed to model the interaction between the mill particles and the natural marine aerosol. A bubble nebuliser was developed to produce an artificial sea salt aerosol which was reacted with a metal powder in the fluidised bed of the rig. The metal powder was then aged under controlled relative humidity (RH) conditions. It was shown that an iron powder, after reaction and aging at 75% RH, developed an aqueous surface layer which quickly led to electrochemical corrosion, dissolution and oxidation of the particle surface. Evidence of this corrosion of metal particles occurring in the environment was found in a SEM-EDX study of the mill particles deposited on pine needles downwind of the mill. It was argued that these reactions would increase the bio-availability of the particle components. A model which incorporated these observations was developed to describe the morphogenesis of atmospheric primary particles during aging in the New Zealand environment. XPS was used to study ambient aerosols deposited on both botanical and artificial passive sampling surfaces. Plant leaves were shown to be excellent collectors of particulate material and were suited to analysis by XPS. Site differences in the atmospheric aerosol load and composition were detected on vine leaves located on a hill side (high NaCl) and at a roadside (high sulfate and silicates) in a rural area. Zn and Fe species were detected by XPS on pine needles up to 2 km downwind of the steel mill.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic Applications of Bayesian Inference to Glass Evidence</field><field name="creator">Curran, James Michael</field><field name="description">The role of the scientist in the courtroom has come under more scrutiny this century than ever before.

An important step to managing invasive ant species is determining the factors responsible for their current and potential distribution. This thesis examines the spatial distribution of invasive ant species at a range of scales. The focus is on the Pacific region, specifically Fiji and New Zealand, which have a relatively high number of invasive ant species. Taxonomic checklists of the ant fauna of Fiji and New Zealand are presented. Climate variables were used to model the distribution of, and predict suitable areas for, particular invasive ant species. In general, models had high evaluation success, especially for models that were built and tested within a region. However, the utility of models was far less when transferred and tested in new regions. A better understanding of how climate variables directly and indirectly affect a species is needed to improve the utility of species distribution modeling. On a finer spatial scale, habitat partitioning was evident at Colo-i-Suva Park in Fiji, where distinct ant communities were sampled from litter and canopy habitats. Results suggested that body size, habitat and resource utilisation interact to create opportunities for invasion, and influence the susceptibility of different habitats. Habitat also shaped the assembly of ant communities and mediated inter-specific competition in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. Similarly, habitat was important in partitioning ant communities in New Zealand; endemic ant species were in forest, and invasive species in scrub and urban habitats. However, there was no evidence that inter-specific competition influenced community composition or the distribution of invasive ant species at regional or local scales in New Zealand. The extent and diversity of exotic ant species arriving at the New Zealand border was also investigated. A high proportion (&gt;64%) of intercepted ants originated from the Pacific. The effectiveness of detecting exotic ant species at the New Zealand border ranged from 48-78% for different pathways, indicating a number of species remain undetected. Future work on invasive ants should focus on species-specific tolerances, and how the physical environment and small scale abiotic conditions influence distribution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frederick Weld: a political biography</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jeanine Marie</field><field name="description">Frederick Weld arrived in New Zealand early in 1884, an unassuming and shy twenty-year old with high hopes and modest assets.

Nida of the United Bible Societies. The practice of Bible translation in the modern era was greatly influenced by Nida, and still is to a great extent. His &#8216;functional equivalence&#8217; approach to translation gave priority to communicating the meaning of the text instead of merely retaining the form. His approach also included testing the translation to ensure that average readers understood the meaning. Nida&#8217;s approach was expanded upon by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) into what is known as the &#8216;meaning-based&#8217; approach. The difference between it and the functional equivalence approach is mainly one of degree, with the meaningbased approach being freer in several respects than Nida&#8217;s approach. However, there has been a movement away from Nida (as well as SIL&#8217;s meaning-based approach) among many Bible translators. The reasons for this shift are varied, although one major influence has been the growing awareness that the language communities who are the recipients of these translations should have a major part in deciding what kind of translation will be prepared. Such communities often prefer more literal translations. Yet they are seldom given the background information they need to make an informed decision about what approach is appropriate for them, partly because no studies exist which document the objective evaluation and comparison of different approaches to translation of the Bible. This thesis documents actual testing of three types of translation in the Thai language to determine which one most clearly communicates the meaning of the Bible. It was found that the meaning-based translation communicated most clearly for some stories that were tested, the functional equivalence translation achieved the second best results, and a semi-literal translation had the most significant communication problems. The findings also provide dramatic evidence about the limits any translation of the Bible has for people who have never heard its message before. This thesis also describes a new kind of testing of translation quality which the author developed in order to objectively compare different translations in Thai. Subjects were asked to read translated passages and then take a written multiple-choice test about the meaning of the translation. This new kind of testing has several advantages over the kind of testing in general use by most Bible translators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Comparative Form, Function and Ecology of some New Zealand Brittle-Stars (Ophiuroidea)</field><field name="creator">Pentreath, Richard John</field><field name="description">In her classic review of the echinoderms, Hyman (1955), describes the ophiuroids as "the most successful echinoderm group living today".

The early stages in the formation of continuous anodic layers of bismuth oxide were studied using the technique of cyclic voltammetry. During this period, the oxide, Bi2O3, covered the surface by a process of simultaneous thickening and spreading of patches. The study of oxide nucleation classified the metal surface into two different areas with different kinetics of oxide nucleation. The ratio of the two areas varied according to the history and original preparation of the surface. Film nucleation was also studied by the galvanostatic step and potentiostatic step methods. The rate of spreading of the oxide patches over the surface was shown to be controlled by the magnitude of the surface area still uncovered. Film thickening was studied using both galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The high field growth law i = &#256; exp (B&#274;) where i is the current density and &#274; the field in the oxide layer, was found with parameters &#256; = (1 &#177; 0.5) x 10-5 A cm-2 B = (2.0 &#177; 0.5) x 10-6 cm V-1 This value of B gives an activation distance for high-field ion transport, a* = 0.2 nm, comparable to the radius of a lattice site. These parameters were determined for very thin films in strongly alkaline electrolyte (pH 13; thickness &lt;30 nm). At greater film thickness, cracking of the film gave a porous layer on top of a continuous barrier layer, and the apparent value of the parameter B increased to 1.7 x 10-5 cm v-1. All previous work on the bismuth anodic film thickening process has been affected to some extent by cracking of the film. In this work, cracking of the film was confirmed by microscopic observation, including scanning electron microscopy. Dissolution of the film, giving breakdown of the oxide layer and pitting of the metal, was an important phenomenon. It became particularly significant for pH &lt;8. The thickness attained by the anodic bismuth oxide layer was limited by this process to only 4 nm at pH 5, increasing to over 200 nm at pH 13. The cathodic reduction of the oxide proceeded from the outer surface inwards, and a rough, porous metal surface resulted. A model involving electron injection from the metal into the oxide, diffusion of electrons through the film and their reaction at the outer surface has been proposed. Microscopic observation confirmed the porous nature of the electro-reduced surface. The transient conductivity of the bismuth anodic film has been investigated, and the effects of standing at open-circuit in the electrolyte or of heating in air studied. The galvanostatic method was used. The observed effects could be adequately explained as being due to the presence ofanon-stoichiometric, n-type (excess metal) layer at the film-solution interface. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the possibility of nucleation of anodic bismuth oxo-halides from solutions containing halide ions. Solutions containing fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide at pH 4-9, phosphate and phosphate with added methanol at pH 8.5 were used. Consideration of thermodynamic stability would indicate the formation of new phases, but results showed that, in the comparatively short time scale of the experiments, kinetic factors resulted in the formation of anodic Bi2O3, except when the solution contained iodide at low pH, when the oxo-iodide, BiOI, was probably formed. Room lighting had no effect on the cyclic voltammetric or galvanostatic measurements. The transient response of anodic films on bismuth to an intense flash of white light was studied. In the case of a thick anodic oxide film (240 nm), the results were interpreted in terms of photo-excitation of the film, producing electron-hole pairs which were separated by the applied field. The recombination process was best described as rate-limiting thermal excitation of trapped electrons. The lifetime of an electron in the conduction band of anodic Bi2O3 was determined: &#964;c = 23 ms. The photo-response of a very thin anodic oxide film (4 nm) involved internal photo-emission of electrons from the metal into the oxide. Formation of a positive space charge by the injection of extra cations from the metal into the film followed. The transient photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) or photo-current (potentiostatic experiments) showed the decay of both excess electronic and ionic space charges. The density of electron traps in the anodic oxide film was determined as NT &gt; 3 x 1018 cm-3. When the anodic film was formed in a solution containing bromide or iodide at pH 5, an inversion of the sign of the primary photo-effect from that observed in the absence of additives (4 nm thick film) was seen, and interpreted in terms of the photo-excitation of halide ions incorporated in the film. The lifetime of a conduction electron in anodic BiOI was determined as 1.5 &#177; 0.2 ms, much less than in anodic Bi2O3 (23 ms). In all the studies of the photo-effect, Gauss' theorem was used to relate the observed photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) to the photo-induced charge separation. An approximate value of the conduction electron mobility in anodic Bi2O3 was thus obtained: &#956; &#8771; 5 x 10-8 cm2 V-1 s-1. Parameters for the evolution of hydrogen on the bare bismuth metal surface, were obtained: b = 0.11 V, log10(i0/Acm-2) = -10.3 and (&#8706;(log10i0)/&#8706;(PH))&#951; = 0 where &#951; = E &#8211; 60 pH mV.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the mode of action of the antitumour acridine 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA)</field><field name="creator">Wilson, William R.</field><field name="description">1.	The mode of action of a novel antitumor acridine 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)-methansulphon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) has been investigated. Two congeners of m-AMSA, 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphonanilide (AMSA) and 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-o-anisidide (o-AMSA) were also studied for comparative purposes. M-AMSA is being evaluated clinically at present under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A. 2.	Treatment of mice bearing the mast cell tumour, mastocytoma P815, with m-AMSA provided some complete cures. AMSA was almost as effective as m-AMSA but its dose potency was 6-fold lower. o-AMSA was inactive. 3.	m-AMSA was found to have a short half-life in mice. Loss of m-AMSA from plasma was due, in part, to the formation of highly fluorescent covalent protein adducts. The rate of this reaction was similar for all three AMSA congeners, and is probably not required for antitumour activity. 4.	The reaction of AMSA drugs with proteins was shown to occur by nucleophilic displacement of the methanesulphonanilide moiety. Evidence is presented that the thiols are the predominant reaction centres in proteins. 5.	A tissue culture model for the antitumour action of m-AMSA was developed using mastocytoma P815 cells. Profound growth inhibition and eventual killing was demonstrated using drug concentrations and durations of exposure attainable in mice. The potencies of the three AMSA congeners paralleled their antitumour potencies in vivo, except at very high drug concentrations. 6.	The rates of biotransformation of AMSA drugs, and their extent of uptake by cells in culture, could not account for the differing potencies of the three AMSA congeners. 7.	M-AMSA prevented the progression of mastocytoma cells through the cell division cycle under conditions where net cell growth was unaffected. Physiologically attainable drug concentrations inhibited chromosome condensation in cells which were less than 10 minutes from the G2-phase/mitosis boundary at the time of drug addition. The sedimentation rate on alkaline sucrose gradients of DNA from cells treated with m-AMSA was lower than that from untreated cells, suggesting that this agent may cause fragmentation of DNA. 8.	A new method for the investigation of the cell cycle stage selectivity of antitumour drugs was developed. This technique demonstrated that m-AMSA and AMSA have significant cycle stage selectivity, the growth of cells late in cycle being most affected. 9.	Spectrophotometric determinations of binding parameters for the interaction of AMSA derivatives with native DNA indicated that m-AMSA bound with lower affinity that did o-AMSA or AMSA. This conclusion was supported by the helix stabilization caused by these drugs. However, the association constants were sufficiently high for each derivative to ensure that essentially all intracellular drug available for binding to DNA would be bound. 10.	The ration of the association constant for native DNA to that for a single-stranded viral RNA was higher for m-AMSA than for AMSA. This selectivity, if operative in vivo, could account for the high dose potency of m-AMSA.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270199 Biochemistry and cell biology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical studies of macromolecules</field><field name="creator">Wills, Peter Rowland</field><field name="description">Hydrodynamic theories of macromolecular structure have been critically examined and used in the experimental study of the conformation of various biological molecules. This work has been carried out giving careful consideration to ancient and modern wisdom. The fundamental molecular structure of liver glycogen has been investigated using a variety of biophysical techniques, including intensity fluctuation spectroscopy. It has been found that above a certain minimum size, molecules of this material are hydrodynamically equivalent to one another, and behave as if comprised of ideal spherical subunits. Smaller molecules do not have a smooth hydrodynamic surface and display a much higher degree of frictional interaction with the aqueous solvent. It has also been shown that when treated with disulphide-bond breaking reagents, large glycogen molecules are disrupted, but the structure of the subunits is undisturbed. The role of protein in glycogen structure has been confirmed by these studies. Intensity fluctuation spectroscopy has also been applied to the study of protein conformation. The frictional coefficients of bovine serum albumin monomers and dimers have been measured, and an apparent conformational change in the monomer detected upon the binding of salicylate. The unfolding and subsequent aggregation of lysozyme when it is thermally denatured have been observed and the hydrodynamic radii of the native, folded state and the expanded, unfolded state of protein have been measured.

Smith</field><field name="description">One of the traditional aims of the philosophy of science has been to formulate a methodology of science&#8212;that is, a normative theory of scientific method. The rules and standards of such a theory are intended to capture the central features of scientific rationality and to explain the sense in which scientific knowledge progressively grows. Although no particular methodology of science has won universal endorsement, it is generally agreed among philosophers that the broad aim of constructing one is both reasonable and worth pursuing in order to understand the nature of scientific growth. But this aim has also been attacked as fundamentally misconceived by some critics who maintain that no theory of method can do justice to actual science. The objections to the philosophical program of framing a methodology of science come mainly from three quarters. Firstly, there is Paul Feyerabend, according to whom the historical development of science reveals that no set of general normative rules and standards can be given for science. Most of the rules and standards hitherto proposed, he contends, have been violated by scientists and, moreover, were necessarily violated, owing to the incommensurability of revolutionary scientific theories. Secondly, there is Michael Polanyi, who claims that scientific rationality cannot be codified in the explicit rules and standards of any theory of method because much of scientific knowledge and practice is 'tacit' and reflects the personal, unspecifiable contributions of individual scientists. And thirdly, sociologists of scientific knowledge (in particular, those of the Strong Programme) assert that the nature and content of science should be explained in sociological terms rather than by reference to a methodology of science. However, it is argued here that the objections made by Feyerabend, Polanyi and the sociologists to the possibility of a theory of method do not stand up to critical examination. A large part of the anti-methodologists' case is based not only on an overly narrow view of the nature of a theory of method, but also on the mistaken belief that the traditional philosophical and epistemological approach to the investigation of scientific rationality should be replaced by a largely descriptive analysis of scientific practice. This belief is criticised on the grounds that a normative methodology must not be supposed to explain scientific practice, nor can views on the nature of scientific rationality be derived from descriptions of scientific practice. Finally, it is suggested that the positions of Feyerabend, Polanyi, and the Strong Programme have deep affinities with the 'practice-oriented' philosophy of the later Wittgenstein. This may, perhaps, explain why they abandon realist construals of scientific theories, of scientific standards, and of the notion of truth. Like Wittgenstein, they adopt a form of antirealism and conventionalism which leads, ultimately, to a relativist interpretation of scientific standards and knowledge. Coupled with the anti-methodologists' failure to defeat the possibility of a theory of method, this relativism demonstrates the poverty of an attack on method constructed on wittgensteinian lines.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of serial correlation on linear models</field><field name="creator">Triggs, Christopher M.</field><field name="description">Given a linear regression model y = X&#946; + e, where e has a multivariate normal distribution N(0, &#931;) consequences of the erroneous assumption that e is distributed as N(0, I) are considered.

Tests fox the classroom measurement of two components were developed. The components were; PHIL(CC), the claiming of concern for other persons as an overriding, universal, and prescriptive principle in moral decision making; and; GIG, knowledge of factual information which is relevant in making moral decisions which subjects face. The test development exercise was undertaken at a time when public interest in moral education was growing. The recent demand for moral education in Auckland is reviewed. Over the last fifteen years, since the Currie Commission Report, reports by committees investigating the purposes of schools have increasingly emphasised moral and social education as school objectives. The Department of Education appeared to be sympathetic towards the cause of moral education. The submissions made by the public during the Educational Development Conference suggested that, in general, parents and citizens were prepared to consider innovative programmes in social or moral education, although there was little agreement on what form such training or education should take. A number of teachers were supporters of moral education. The primary purpose in constructing tests for Wilson's components was to provide an instrument which would assist in the evaluation of moral education curriculum projects in Auckland secondary schools. Evidence concerning descriptive, content, domain selection, construct and concurrent validity is presented. Kuder-Richardson, retest and criterion-referenced reliability studies were undertaken. It is claimed that an instrument with sufficient validity and reliability has bean produced for the summative evaluation of curriculum projects, and the diagnostic investigation of class groups using the test as a criterion-referenced measure. Auckland intermediate and secondary school pupils were surveyed, using the tests produced and punch card recording in an attempt to identify significant variables. Over 1,100 children completed the tests under controlled conditions. Significant variables identified using the test for PHIL(CC) were socio-economic level for twelve-year-old children, and intelligence for sixteen-year-old children. The effect of schooling appeared to be significant at all levels. Age does not appear to markedly increase children's concern for others. Age was related to performance in the knowledge test. Older children knew more. Other significant variables for GIG were socio-economic level (middle levels performed better) and the effects of schooling. There was some evidence that females know more than males. In both tests it appears that there is considerable interaction between the variables. Suggestions for the further development of the tests are given.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An input-output model of Northland's economy: with application to forestry</field><field name="creator">Moore, Chris (Christopher Ivor),1947-</field><field name="description">This work presents a 50-industry input-output model of Northland's economy and demonstrates how input-output analysis could be used to enhance regional planning in New Zealand. As it is the first regional input-output model in this country to incorporate significant survey and secondary data the survey procedure and model construction are outlined. The input-output table is used to discuss important regional transactions and the purchase and sales patterns of industries. The model analyses industries' contributions to export receipts and import payments and calculates the impact of changes in export receipts on regional income and imports. A comprehensive multiplier analysis of Northland's economy covers output, income, employment and imports and confidence limits for the multipliers are developed using the Monte Carlo technique to simulate survey errors. The model explores the economic implications of forestry expansion in Northland and discusses the areas available for afforestation, planting rates, tree management, wood supply and wood processing options in the region. The modifications made to the model and data requirements for simulating forestry expansion are outlined and employment and income impacts given for three types of processing complexes and for forestry expansion as a whole. Finally an economic evaluation is made of the impacts of processing-plant construction and supporting services.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding in d10 transition metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Whiting, R.

(Cheng Yi), 1938-</field><field name="description">Building on Kibblewhite's long term investigations of the nonlinear wave-wave interactions and the infrasonic ocean noise and the microseisms these induce, this thesis further explores the physical nature of these processes. The classical description of this interaction, which takes into account only the homogeneous component of the induced field, has been extended to include the inhomogeneous component. A complete expression for the wave induced noise spectrum is established following a geometrical analysis of the dispersion relations among interacting waves. The relative importance of these two components and their directivity properties are also calculated and discussed. It is shown that while at observation points deeper than 500 meters the effects of the inhomogeneous component can be regarded as negligible, it can cause an increase of noise level of up to 40 dB in the region near the surface of the sea. Furthermore, in contrast to the nearly omni-directional distribution of the homogeneous component of the induced acoustic field, there is a tendency for the energy associated with the inhomogeneous component to focus in the wind direction. Based upon a multilayer analysis of a visco-elastic geoacoustic model, Green's functions and the spectral transfer functions relating the surface source pressure field to the underwater noise and microseism fields are derived for both near and far field cases. A 3-dimensional presentation defined on the dispersion plane (frequency and horizontal wave number) is introduced to describe the sea bottom reflection-loss and, Green's functions, and is extended to include the inhomogeneous region for the first time. The characteristics of this 3-D presentation are explained in terms of the geoacoustic parameters. The influence of the interaction of multiple seas (and swell) on the induced acoustic field are also discussed in this thesis. All these effects are considered in the calculation of the synthetic spectra of both the noise and microseism field. When compared with measured data excellent agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental results, which provides further confirmation that the nonlinear interaction is the most important source of the infrasonic ocean noise, as well as confirming the basic validity of the procedure introduced by Kibblewhite and Ewans to derive the ocean noise spectra from microseism records.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A privileged moment: 'dialogue' in the language of the Second Vatican Council 1962-65</field><field name="creator">Nolan, Ann Michele</field><field name="description">No digital copy at the request of the author - refer to citation field for details of published version.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and development of intellectually handicapped children</field><field name="creator">Sims, Margaret R.</field><field name="description">There have been no studies in New Zealand designed to investigate the effectiveness of the major "systems-based" intervention programme available for intellectually handicapped children; the service offered by the New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped. The Society does not have a standardised programme running in all its Preschool/Special Care Centres throughout the country. However, the Auckland branch developed a formalised approach to programming and teaching in 1979. This study attempted to determine the effectiveness of this new approach in terms of the children it was designed to benefit. It was found that children attending Auckland Preschool/Special Care Centres did show greater rates of progress than children attending Preschool/Special Care Centres outside Auckland for a variety of different skills. For Downs Syndrome children these were self-help, cognitive and language skills. For motor-delayed multihandicapped children the skills were selp-help and language. These differences persisted when differences between the social and environmental backgrounds of the children from Auckland and outside Auckland were controlled for. It was also found that Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children showed different rates of progress for motor, socialisation, cognitive/academic and language skills. Rates of progress were not different for self-help skills although the absolute level of achievement was significantly different for the three populations. The three groups of children showed different rates of growth in a variety of physical measurements, and different absolute sizes in several others. Downs Syndrome children have shorter limbs than either of the other two groups of children. They also have the narrowest jaws and a small thorax. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children have the smallest limb diameters but have the longest faces. Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children differ in several ways in their social and environmental backgrounds. Parents of Downs Syndrome children are older than parents of the other two groups. Mothers of intellectually handicapped children are less likely to have a job than mothers of normal children. Different health records are evident between the three populations. Normal children tend to be seen as more healthy by their parents. Intellectually handicapped children tend to have less ascorbic acid in their diet than normal children. Downs Syndrome children are more susceptible to minor environmental fluctuations than motor-delayed multihandicapped or normal children. The cumulative effect of this hostile environment can be seen in their short stature and smaller overall body dimensions compared to normal children. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children do not show the same reaction to the environment as Downs Syndrome children. In this more severely handicapped group, the effect of the motor and intellectual handicap over-rides any effect the environment might have. However, nutritional intake is closely related to physical growth in these children. This is because in most cases exercise does not mediate between nutritional intake and physical growth.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the Alseuosmiaceae</field><field name="creator">Gardner, R. O. (Rhys Owen), 1949-</field><field name="description">The flowering plant family Alseuosmiaceae comprises three genera of shrubs: Alseuosmia A. Cunn. from New Zealand; Memecylanthus Gilg and Schltr. and Periomphale Baill. (=Pachydiscus Gilg and Schltr.) from New Caledonia. These genera are readily excluded from their traditional position in the Caprifoliaceae by virtue of their alternate leaves, valvate corolla lobes and their southern hemisphere distribution. Four species of Alseuosmia, including one hitherto undescribed species, are accepted here. The New Caledonian genera are poorly represented in herbaria; they may each be monotypic. Condensed tannin (leucocyanidin) and ellagitannin are abundant in all Alseuosmia tissues. Other simple phenolic compounds here (as detected in acid hydrolysates) include quercetin, kaempferol, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid. Triterpenoid saponins are abundant in leaf tissue; alkaloids and probably iridoid compounds too, are absent. Tannin is found throughout the ovary tissue of Alseuosmia and in the inner and outer epidermises of the ovular integument. The floral vascular anatomy is detailed for the Alseuosmiaceae and reviewed for eight allied families. No features of the vascular system imply particular affinity of the Alseuosmiaceae with any of these allies. Within this family the association of different morphological and anatomical floral features supports the contention that primitive characters tend to be associated with one another in their distribution throughout the members of a taxon. The primary vascular pattern in the stem of Alseuosmia is of an open (sympodial) nature. The mature nodal anatomy is 3-trace trilacunar. All genera have a stem endodermis with prominent Casparian banding, and in Alseuosmia at least this endodermis passes through the secondary and quaternary stages (lignification-suberisation of walls; accumulation of phenolic compounds) as found in a typical root endodermis. All species of Alseuosmia lack rays in the secondary wood, whereas memecylanthus and Periomphale have extremely tall (indefinitely-prolonged?) rays. The vessels of these genera are relatively primitive (end-plate angle c.10-19&#176;, no bars per scalariform plate c.16-37), and thus are comparable to vessels of the Escalloniaceae and Caprifoliaceae. The root periderm has a cortical origin in Alseuosmia and the root pith is persistent. Multicellular uniseriate hairs are found in the leaf axils in all Alseuosmiaceae. Hairs with similar structure and development are found in some genera of Pittosporaceae but not, so far as is known, in other related groups. Within Pittosporum, these uniseriate hairs appear to be homologous with the T-hairs many species have. The chromosome number of 2n=18 probably characterises all the species of Alseuosmia. A. macrophylla A. Cunn. is an obligate outbreeder with an incompatibility mechanism operating at the stylar level, while A. pusilla is self-compatible. Pollinating agents for the species are unknown. No internal barriers to hybridism exist between A. macrophylla and A. banksii A. Cunn. and the hybrid swarm between these species is recognised here as A. X quercifolia A. Cunn. Neither do internal barriers exist between A. macrophylla and A. pusilla, but differences in flowering time and mode of breeding help to keep these species separate in the field. Mature pollen of Alseuosmia is trinucleate: the ovule is uni-tegmic-tenuinucellate. The distinctness of the Alseuosmiaceae is upheld and its affinities are suggested to be with the Escalloniaceae, and to a lesser extent, with the Pittosporaceae.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dendroclimatic study of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha)</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jonathan Gray</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates some of the potential of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha) for dendrochronological research, especially dendroclimatology. The type of vegetation associated with sites producing a chronology showed no obvious pattern. The resulting non-specific range of suitable sites for dendrochronological sampling was thought to be a favorable species characteristic. Standardization of tree-ring series using a 50-year Gaussian filter resulted in 28% improvement of retained common variance above that obtained from using conventional polynomial filters. The problem of autocorrelation was investigated. Tanekaha had a consistent autocorrelation pattern through both space (i.e. latitudinal and altitudinal ranges) and time (preserved forest and contemporary stands). P. glaucus (toatoa) also showed a spatially consistent yet distinctive pattern. These different diagnostic patterns implied a non-climatic cause (i.e. physiological), illustrating the need to ensure their removal before species chronologies are compared or used for climate modelling. Low order autoregressive models (ARMA(p,0)) were used to filter out the significant levels of autocorrelation. Subsequent comparison of the chronologies showed a consistent and highly significantly correlated pattern between both sites and species. The paucity of information about the physiology of Phyllocladus spp. led to the testing of several climatic variables in response function analyses. The "best" variables (based on only statistical evidence) were minimum monthly temperature, monthly total raindays and an optimal 12 month span of August (t) to July (t+1). Preliminary attempts with response functions using different combinations of predictor (climate variables) and predictand (chronologies) data sets generally failed to verify. Neither the extent of time from which the response functions were based (no analogue situation) nor a supposed "physiological shock" period (poor growth period) were the causes for non-verification. Further investigation showed that, for both the individual and combined chronologies, the temperature response was similar but rainfall varied. The instability through time of the rainfall response was particularly disconcerting since it broke one of the fundamental assumptions used in dendroclimatology. It was therefore concluded that climatic reconstruction could be attempted only on the temperature data. The temperature data of three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) were tried with transfer function models. Of these the summer season explained the most variance and had the highest reduction of error(RE) values. The selected model used the period 1918 to 1982 for calibration and 1853 to 1917 for verification. Summer temperatures from 1982 to 1750 were reconstructed. The reconstruction modeled only c.30% of the variance but was highly correlated to the summer temperature series developed by Norton (1983). This was interpreted as further independent verification of the reconstructed series. The summer temperatures reconstructed from 1982 to 1750 were concluded to have been similar to the recorded pattern from 1853. The same regressors were applied to the buried forest chronology and the summer temperatures reconstructed from 105 BC to AD 175. Because of the non-continuous tree-ring record no comment can be made of actual ambient conditions in comparison to those of today. However, the reconstructed pre-Taupo summer series did show increased variation towards the time of the eruption and more pronounced cool summers than hot ones. Another applied use of a tanekaha chronology was demonstrated with 14C dating. A statistically significant fit of 14C ages was obtained between twelve contiguous decades from the buried forest tanekaha chronology with that from a Northern hemisphere decadal calibration curve based on Sequioadendron giganteum(Stuiver &amp; Becker 1986). This "wiggle-matching" to the calibration curve places the year of the Taupo eruption as AD 177&#177;18 10. An Independent check of the "new" date was conducted using the most reliable data of Healy et al. (1964) with the same calibration series as described above. A date of AD177&#177;4 44 was obtained which supports the wiggle-matched date. The confidence interval of the wiggle-matched date also coincides with the date proposed by Wilson et al. (1980) of AD186 (based purely on ancient written records).</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biological control of sapstain of Pinus radiata with microorganisms</field><field name="creator">Kay, Stuart James</field><field name="description">A total of six hundred and sixteen fungal and two hundred and thirty two bacterial isolates were obtained either from the sapwood of Pinus radiata or from other sources, including UV mutagenesis. All isolates were screened on Pinus radiata wood chips for their survival and colonisation attributes. Of these isolates, two hundred and eighty two failed to grow or caused permanent deep seated discolourations or decay and were eliminated from the study. The remaining five hundred and sixty six isolates were assessed for their antagonistic ability against sapstain. In a dual screen on Pinus radiata wood chips, one hundred and twelve fungal and four bacterial isolates inhibited the growth of the known sapstain fungus, Ophiostoma piceae. In a second biological control screen, on Pinus radiata wood blocks, isolates of Gliocladium viride, Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma hamatum, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichothecium roseum and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae proved inhibitory to the sapstain isolates Ophiostoma piceae and Sphaeropsis sapinea providing between 94 and 100% control. These isolates were considered for further examination in the field. The remaining isolates provided poor or inconsistent inhibition or were mould fungi and, therefore, not suitable for direct application. All fungal and bacterial isolates that had shown inhibitory ability in the initial biological control screen and the remaining non-staining bacteria were examined for their ability to produce non-volatile metabolites that were inhibitory to sapstain. The bacterial isolates were examined in a preliminary dual plate screen in which 91 isolates were identified as producing inhibitory compounds. The best of these bacterial isolates were screened, with the fungal isolates, in a non-volatile metabolite trial utilising filter sterilised culture filtrates. Isolates of Bacillus sp., Fusarium solani, Gliocladium roseum, Gliocladium virens, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichoderma viride and Trichothecium roseum were found to be significantly inhibitory to the growth of Ophiostoma piceae at concentrations of 50% or less. However, the filtrates did not provide adequate sapstain control, when tested on Pinus radiata wood block, to prompt consideration for further examination in the field. Studies are currently examining several of these isolates for the production of biologically active compounds. The six most promising isolates, from the wood chip and wood block trials, were tested in the field for their ability to control sapstain on unseasoned Pinus radiata sapwood and/or peeled logs. These were Gliocladium viride (FK75), Trichoderma hamantum (FK561), Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247), Trichothecium roseum (FK238) and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae (FK33). The fungi were prepared as mycelial/spore homogenates. For application to the timber, the homogenates were mixed with 0.2% Alcosorb gel, producing 108 cfu/ml suspensions, these suspensions were applied by dipping. Diluted homogenates, 108 cfu/ml, were applied as spray treatments to the logs. All of the biological control agent treatments reduced the level of sapstain on either the logs or timber with Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) providing control equivalent to that of the fungicides NP-1 and Diffusol for portions of the trial. Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) gave sapstain control in excess of 90% for the first 30 days of the timber trial equalling the control provided by NP-1 and Diffusol. In another trial, Trichoderma harzianum (FK228) was more effective than NP-1, providing 60% sapstain control, after six months, on the internal tissue of Pinus radiata logs. The six isolates selected for the field trials were examined in additional studies. In a dual inoculation study, Trichoderma sp. (FK247) exhibited localised antibiotic ability causing the lysis of mycelium of sapstain fungi. There was no evidence of mycoparasitic action by any of the six isolates. Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) were observed to degrade cellulose. However, neither these nor the other isolates caused a significant change in the mechanical properties of Pinus radiata timber when compared to untreated controls. Decreasing pH or the addition of nitrate were identified as having potential for the promotion of biological control agent growth. The potential of mixed biological control agent inoculations was also examined. While these results are preliminary, they are extremely encouraging and provide a basis from which future studies can develop.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gas transport and storage processes in the lacunar system of Egeria densa Planch.</field><field name="creator">Sorrell, Brian.</field><field name="description">Aquatic macrophytes possess an internal lacunar system of proliferated intercellular airspaces. Lacunar gas exchange processes were investigated in Egeria densa Planch., a submerged freshwater angiosperm. Investigations of oxygen exchange between Egeria shoot segments and the water revealed that up to 17% of the photosynthetically-produced oxygen is retained within the lacunae. A consequence of this partitioning, which results from the relatively low solubility of oxygen in water, is the development of internal lacunar pressures up to 20 kPa above atmospheric pressure. This storage of oxygen in Egeria casts doubts on oxygen-based measurements of productivity in aquatic macrophytes, unless both internal and external sinks are monitored. Pressurisation also revealed that storage is greater in static water than in flowing water, suggesting that boundary layer limitations to oxygen transfer can also affect partitioning. Pressures fall to sub-atmospheric values in the dark, due to respiratory consumption of the internal oxygen. The Egeria respiratory gas exchanges in the dark demonstrated a steady concentration gradient between plant and water within an hour of darkening. However, the material steadily consumes approximately 30% of its respired oxygen from the lacunae, rather than the water. This oxygen supply is again due to the low oxygen solubility. The lacunae also assist the radial oxygen supply into the respiring tissue; it was found that the Michaelis-Menten constant for the respiratory response to oxygen tension in Egeria was some two to three times greater in material with infiltrated lacunae than in uninfiltrated material. Oxygen storage in the stem lacunae resulted in a longitudinal (shoot to root) movement of this gas, which was monitored using a bicompartment apparatus. The root oxygen release rate varied with light intensity and water flow rate in a similar manner to the internal pressure changes. Further experiments, involving measurements of the oxygen flux rates in the Egeria rhizosphere, demonstrated that this root oxygen loss is capable of effecting substantial diurnal oxygen fluctuations in the surrounding sediment. These processes may be interrupted by natural infiltration of the airspaces, but the factors involved here remain uncertain. The mean internal oxygen transport rate in Egeria (6.28 &#956;102 h-1) was consistent with estimates of lacunar oxygen concentration gradients calculated from Fick's Law, suggesting that diffusion is the oxygen transport mechanism in Egeria. However, by connecting shoots into manometers, internal pressure gradients of some 0.9 kPa m-1 were detected. These gradients were 103 -fold greater than the pressure gradient required to account for oxygen transport in Egeria, but were transient features, as the pressure equilibrated throughout the lacunar system 20 - 30 minutes after a dark/light change. Mass flow was therefore proposed as a transitory, but potentially significant, contribution to oxygen transport. Root to shoot carbon dioxide transport was measured using 14CO2 tracing. The CO2 uptake (mean internal transport = 4.96 &#956;1CO2 h-1) represented &lt;10% of the total carbon fixed; the concentration of root-derived carbon in shoot tissue declined rapidly from the root insertion point. These results are compared with those of previous studies, and the significance of the Egeria lacunar system assessed.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural studies of selected group VIII metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Marsden, Karen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the single crystal x-ray analyses of six novel organometallic osmium complexes and three complexes of the tridentate dentate ligand 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene with the transition metals iridium, rhodium and ruthenium. The complexes of carbon monosulphide and carbon monotelluride with osmium, OsCl2(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2 and OsCl2(CO)(CTe)(PPh3)2, exhibit linear thio- and telluro-coordination similar to that of the carbonyl. The -CS and -CTe ligands exert strong trans-bond weakening influences. In the dihapto-thioacyl complex of osmium, Os(&#951;1-o2CCF3)[C(S)-(p-tolyl)](CO)(PPh3)2, the bidentate thioacyl is coordinated to the osmium through the carbon and sulphur atoms. This bonding involves a considerable degree of &#960;-interaction between the C, S and Os atoms, concomitant with a lengthening of the C-S bond. The dichlorocarbene complex, OsCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is disordered in the crystalline state. Consequently, while the presence of the dichlorocarbene is verified, no unambiguous conclusions can be drawn from the associated geometry. In the carbyne complex of osmium, Os(C-p-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, the osmium is in a trigonal bipyramidal environment with an approximately linear arrangement of the Os-C-R group. The Os-Ccarbyne bond is short (corresponding to a bond order of ca. 3), confirming the formation of the C-p-tolyl group as a carbyne. The formaldehyde ligand in the osmium complex, Os(&#951;2-CH2O)(CO)2(PPh3)2, is bonded to the osmium centre via both the carbon and oxygen atoms. The C-O bond of the formaldehyde lengthens considerably upon coordination, resulting in a bond order apparently less than 1. Also present in the crystal structure are molecules of water which are hydrogen bonded into pairs (O&#8230;O separation 2.56 &#197;). The (H2O)2 units do not hydrogen bond to any other atoms, but rather occupy hydrophobic interstices in the structure. The three complexes of 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene, (BDPH), IrIIICl3(BDPH), RhIIICl3(BDPH), and RuIICl2(CO)(BDPH) are isomorphous. The ruthenium complex is, however, disordered in the crystalline state. In each of the three structures the olefin of the BDPH moiety is only weakly bound to the metal, leaving the C-C double bond virtually unchanged from that of the free ligand. The olefin exerts a stronger trans-bond weakening influence than do the chlorine ligands in these complexes.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circadian organization in the regulation of locomotor activity and reproduction in Rattus exulans</field><field name="creator">Gander, Philippa H.</field><field name="description">The role of the circadian time-keeping system in regulation of locomotor activity and certain aspects of reproduction has been investigated in wild Polynesian rats, Rattus exulans. Locomotor activity is under circadian control and data are consistent with a general model of the pacemaker mechanism as a weakly interacting population of circadian oscillators. Experimental studies and field observations indicate that the action of light in entrainment of this rhythm is primarily non-parametric. Female R. exulans continue to ovulate during prolonged periods in constant conditions and undergo a pattern of change in vaginal cytology through the estrous cycle which closely resembles that of laboratory R. norvegicus. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the estrous cycle in R. exulans is regulated by a similar circadian mechanism to that controlling the timing of ovulation, and hence the duration of estrous cycle, in laboratory rats. Female R. exulans do not exhibit regular fluctuations in either the period of the activity rhythm or intensity of the active phase in association with the estrous cycle. Ovariectomy also has no significant effect on the period of the activity rhythm and no discernible effect on the distribution or intensity of activity. It is therefore concluded that there is no feedback action of the ovaries or estradiol on the circadian pacemaker regulating locomotor activity in R. exulans, which thus differs from laboratory rodents. This proposition is further supported by the observation that there are no significant changes in either period or variability of the activity rhythm in association with the degenerative changes that occur in the female reproductive system in old age. The adaptive significance of these findings is considered. Field studies on breeding patterns of R. exulans throughout its distribution provide several lines of indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that the onset of breeding in this species in temperate latitudes is regulated by seasonal changes in photoperiod. Accelerated attainment of puberty occurs in juvenile females collected during the non-breeding part of the year and housed in LD 16:8. Juvenile females collected at the same times but housed in LD 8:16 for an identical duration remain immature. Groups of mature females collected during the breeding season do not show a differential response to these light regimes. These results are discussed in relation to field data on breeding patterns in the population from which experimental animals were collected. It is concluded that the onset of breeding in this population is controlled primarily by a photoperiodic mechanism regulating the attainment of reproductive maturity in females.

The thesis defines biological performance and quality in terms of the success of an insect population in survival and reproduction and regards the laboratory environment as an artificial habitat that insects must colonise in order to survive and reproduce. Changes in biological performance that occurred during 12 successive generations of laboratory rearing were due to selection, acclimatisation and domestication and not adaptation. Artificial colonisation is theoretically successful within a limited range of environmental factors. As the inherent genetic variability of the founder population determines the resilience of the population to changes in performance, the ranges of environmental factors during colonisation should be wide to 'capture' much of the variability. Using body size (weight) as an aspect of overall quality, the thesis presents evidence that the final instar larva of C. jactatana has a threshold mechanism (larval critical weight, LCW) that determines pupal and adult size. There is a proportionate decrease in weight from the maximum weight that a larva attains in the final instar (LMW) to pupa ( described as constant DP ) and to adult (DA). There is a direct relation between the latent feeding period (period between attaining an LCW and LMW), LMW, pupal and adult size, and the reproductive performance (fecundity ). Within the experimental conditions diet quality, temperature, photoperiod and artificial selection had no effect on the larval critical weight, DP or DA, the larval threshold mechanism in C. jactatana is probably a mechanical trigger that initiates pupation. Diet quality, temperature and thermophotoperiods affected pupal size, adult size and reproductive performance. Photoperiod had no significant effects on size and reproductive performance. Positive assortative selections for slow development and low pupal weight significantly decreased pupal and adult size, and reproductive performance. Selection for fast development and heavy pupal weight for three generations had no significant effect on size or reproductive performance. Larval critical weight is demonstrated as useful to define quality indices and predict the performance of laboratory reared insects. The general conclusion of the thesis is that insect quality should be defined more in terms of the success in survival and colonising ability rather than solely on the success for 'intended role' or 'fitness for use'.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of a signal as a function of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise</field><field name="creator">Stillman, Jennifer A.</field><field name="description">A series of experiments was undertaken to explore the effect of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise upon the detection of a signal. The signal was a 2-kHz sinusoid, and the masker was composed of either one or two 800-Hz wide bands of noise. The centre frequencies of the two bands of noise, one above and one below the signal frequency, were varied. On most occasions both noise bands were used to create a spectral notch surrounding the signal. The following factors were manipulated: (1) The width of the notch: from 0 to 1900 Hz. (2) The location of the lower and upper frequency edges of the notch relative to the signal: either equidistant from the signal, or with one edge 150 Hz nearer to the signal than the other edge. (3) The spectrum level of the noise: either 20, 35 or 50 dB SPL. (4) The degree of interaural disparity in the intensity of some components of the noise: either 0 dB, 10 dB or infinite. (5) The ear to which a particular masking noise was sent. (6) The manner in which the noise was presented: either diotically or dichotically. (7) The manner in which the signal was presented: either diotically or monotically. The results of the first two experiments were interpreted as showing that threshold signal levels in the presence of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise depended principally on the ear in which the signal-to-masker ratio at the output of the auditory filter was larger. To test this possibility, auditory filter shapes were derived from two listeners. These were then used to predict thresholds when there were interaural differences in the spectral envelope of a masking noise. The results of a comparison between the predicted and obtained thresholds were consistent with the previous interpretation. Thus it appears that the detector following the filter can discriminate the output of the two ears and base detection on the better output. This ability may be useful in normal listening, where both wanted and extraneous sounds are subject to change from moment to moment.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional promoters in a replication region of F plasmid</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Martin A.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes aspects of genetic regulation within and near a replication origin (ori-1) of the F plasmid. A number of transcriptional promoters were isolated, precisely mapped, and characterized with respect to their strengths and modes of regulation. The principal techniques employed in these investigations were: "shotgun" molecular cloning of restriction fragments into a galactokinase-based promoter selection vector, assays for galactokinase activities, DNA sequencing and S1 nuclease mapping of transcripts. Major findings from this study can be summarized as follows: 1). Promoters for the essential replication genes pifC and E were cloned and shown to be autoregulated at the transcriptional level. 2). An E.coli protein, integration host factor (IHF), was found to modulate the activity of the pif operon promoter. 13). Two promoters which direct transcription in opposite directions from within the minimal ori-1 region were discovered. 4). Transcription from both ori-1 promoters was shown to be repressed by the mini-F encoded D protein. 5). Precise transcriptional startsites of the pifC gene and the two ori-1 promoters were determined. 6). A mini-F protein (D) was shown to resolve dimers of a plasmid which contains a site-specific recombination locus from near ori-1, and a facile assay system for this function was developed.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidation of Ring-A Aromatic Steroids</field><field name="creator">Carlisle, Valerie F.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with a study of the oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids using either chromium trioxide-aqueous sulphuric acid-acetone or chromium trioxide-aqueous acetic acid mixtures. It was found that chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids substituted with a strong electron-donating group, gives rise to products with the site of oxidation being predominantly that para to the activating group. Thus C-3 methoxy ring-A aromatic steroids give the corresponding 9b-hydroxy-11-oxo and 9-oxo-9,11-seco-11-oic acid derivatives as the major products and the 6-oxo derivative as a minor oxidation product. However, a ketol was not formed if a C-3 methoxy ring-A aromatic steroid also contained a substituent at C-1. The C-1-methoxy-4-methyl ring-A aromatic steroids give the 4-carboxy derivative as the major product and again the 6-oxo compound as a minor neutral product. The acetoxy and methyl substituted ring-A aromatic steroids, however, all give rise to the 6-oxo derivatives as the major products. The usual oxidation product of a ring-A aromatic steroid is therefore the 6-oxo product unless it is substituted with a methoxy group in a position which will stabilise an electron deficiency at a site other than C-6. Oxidation will then occur predominantly at the stabilised site unless it is sterically blocked.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Nucleic Acids in Relation to Protein Synthesis</field><field name="creator">Baguley, Bruce C.</field><field name="description">Several methods for the fractionation of transfer RNA have been investigated.

This is accomplished with a two-stage examination of case studies on the China-New Zealand joint ventures in China, involving two case studies in the first stage and one case study in the second stage. The exploratory and narrative research aims to aid theory building in the area of assessment and determination for IJV performance. In an investigation of the case IJVs between the Chinese and New Zealand firms, the study results in the development of three conceptual models of IJV performance and network relationships, namely, the Static Goal Model, the Goal Succession Model, and the Goal Emergence Model. These conceptual models adopt goal attainment as the criterion for assessing UV performance, and address goal attainment from a dynamic perspective by using a network approach. The theoretical models are illustrated and supported by the empirical evidence from the longitudinal case studies. The conceptual models differ from existing models of IJV performance in a number of important aspects, and thus contribute to theory relating to IJV performance in the following ways. These models integrate the concepts from the three research areas of performance, governance structure and dynamic evolution into a conceptual framework addressing IJV performance. Two types (organisational and interpersonal) of IJV network relationships are identified, and complex multiple tiers of network relationships in each type and their influence on JV performance and evolution are discussed. The study highlights the influence of network relationships and their evolution on IJV performance by arguing that IJV performance hinges on whether a trend of institutionalising the mechanism of trust building and conflict resolution and of balancing the network relationships within the IJV arrangement emerges from the process of IJV dynamic evolution. This research was solely undertaken by the author for the purpose of a thesis submitted in fulfilling the requirements for the degree of Ph. D at the University of Auckland.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ascochytula, Ascochytella, Ascochyta and related fungi, with special reference to Ascochyta paspali</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Peter Kenneth</field><field name="description">Two Coelomycete genera, Ascochytula Died. and Ascochytella Tassi, were studied in order to determine their generic affinities, especially with Ascochyta. Ascochytula obiones (Jaap) Died., the type species of Ascochytula, is considered to be congeneric with Ascochyta pisi Lib., the type species of the earlier genus, Ascochyta Lib. Ascochytula is thus reduced to synonymy with Ascochyta. Of the thirty-six species and two varieties named in, or directly associated with, Ascochytula, twenty are herein described as species of Ascochyta and four are excluded from Ascochyta. The remaining species were either not examined, or are nomina dubia. The following names are proposed: Ascochyta asparagina (Petrak) comb. nov., A. deformis (P. Karsten) comb. nov., A. dorycnii (Petrak) comb. nov., A. ludwigiana (Petrak) comb. nov., A. moravica (Petrak) comb. nov., A. obiones (Jaap) comb. nov., A. phlomidicola nom. nov., and A. ulicis (Grove) comb. nov. Ascochytella Tassi, which has often been confused with Ascochytula, is also synonymised with Ascochyta. The original thirteen species in Ascochytella were examined, and A. vicina (Sacc.) Tassi chosen as the lecto-type species. Most of the thirteen species are regarded as being either misplaced in Ascochytella, or nomina dubia, and only four, including the lectotype, are accepted as species of Ascochyta. The name, Placodiplodia canthiifolia (Cooke &amp; Massee) comb. nov. is proposed. The type species of Ascochyta, and of six related genera, Ascochytulina Petrak, Coniothyrium Corda. Diplodina Westend., Pseudodiplodia (P. Karsten) Sacc., Scolecosporiella Petrak, and Stagonospora (Sacc.) Sacc. were studied to determine the distinctions between these six genera and Ascochyta. Microdiplodia Allescher and Diplodia Fr. are also discussed, in relationt to Ascochyta. Ascochyta paspali (H. Sydow) Punith. (&#8801; Ascochytula paspali H. Sydow), which causes a leaf stripe disease of Paspalum dilatatum Poir., an important perennial grass of northern North Island pastures, was examined in detail. At some temperatures, under controlled climate conditions, the fungus significantly reduced the yield of P. dilatatum. A. paspali was found to grow systemically, as mycelium within the xylem vessels, and was able to infect all parts of the plant, including the roots and seeds. Green leaves sometimes became infected systemically without production of visual symptoms. Infected seed is suggested as a means for disease spread. No teleomorph for A. paspali was found, and the fungus is thought to over-winter in the dormant grass. The seasonal fluctuation in levels of P. dilatatum and of the disease was studied in two Northland pastures with paspalum as a component. One pasture was studied for fourteen months, and the other for four months. Disease levels, and paspalum levels, were determined by point quadrat analysis and by sorting of randomly cut samples. Levels of both the host and of the disease peaked in summer, while both were at low levels, or apparently absent, over the winter months.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgement as play: revealing analogies between aesthetics and ethics</field><field name="creator">Kovach, Vanya</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the similarities of process between aesthetic experience and ethical judgement. I claim that in both cases the activity is best described as a type of play in which elements interact in mutual adjustment and transformation. This conception of play has its roots in Kant's aesthetic theory. Describing aesthetic experience as play results in emphasis on three central characteristics. These characteristics become the basis of constraints on judgement. In the case of ethical judgement these are important because they save from subjectivism a moral theory, particularism, which relies on individual judgement rather than moral rules. Seeing the activity of judgement as play suggests a conception of the outcome of judgement as picturing. This conception helps to make sense of reason-giving within the particularist model. A further analogy with the grounds of aesthetic qualities is used to illuminate the problem of justifying the values put into play. These values are ultimately defended in terms of their relationship to human flourishing. Perennial problems for theories based on human flourishing are avoided by my account because prescriptions for action are not derived from the characterisation of flourishing but from the process of individual judgement which values based on flourishing merely inform. One positive effect of adopting my model of judgement as play is the reduction of problems concerning the motivation to act on ethical judgements.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Geography of Contemporary Maori Agriculture</field><field name="creator">Ishida, Hiroshi</field><field name="description">Hypothesis. In little more than a century a transformation has occurred in Maori agriculture. Before 1840, most Maori agriculture could best be described as shifting cultivation. The existence of this form of cultivation in Maori life can be indicated by such terms a Tohea Whenua which means a field exhausted by cultivation and Oneone hou which signifies new soil. In this system the sweet potatoe (Ipomea batatus)was the major crop. Apart from the dog, no other animals were kept. Today shifting cultivation in its technical sense is non-existent and Maori agriculturists are mostly commercial pastoral farmers, keeping dairy cows and sheep. The production of dairy produce and of other pastoral products by the Maori who form 7 percent of the population, is not a very significant proportion of the New Zealand total. It is nevertheless of quite noticeable volume when compared on a world basis with the total output of pastoral production in many other countries. The number of Maori holding in 1959-1960 was 5,227.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of insects: discipline and resistance in the cinema of David Cronenberg</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Scott Alexander</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the films of David Cronenberg which all conduct a consistently thorough examination of the relationship between the ideologically constituted Cartesian subject and the disciplinary structures that surround, control and limit this subject. Cinema, because of the presence of both film form and narrative content, functions as a double articulation of this disciplinary activity. Each film&#8217;s narrative disciplines, on screen, the bodies contained within the plot, even as each film&#8217;s form disciplines both the way in which these cinematic bodies are delivered to an audience, and the way the audience&#8217;s own viewing practices are controlled and composed. Thus it becomes vital to explore the mechanisms implicated in these processes, and to gain an understanding of how Cronenberg&#8217;s cinema works to highlight and critique them. The primary assertion of this thesis is that Cronenberg&#8217;s work functions as a particular style of resistance to hegemony that Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek labels&#8216;heresy&#8217;. For &#381;i&#382;ek,heresy occurs not when one disobeys one&#8217;s ideological requirements, but when one over-fulfills them, thereby extending these ideological demands and disciplinary discursive structures out to a site of logical absurdity. In assessing and charting this territory, the thesis is constructed in the following manner. The first chapter,which outlines my methodology, applies itself to a brief examination of Cronenberg&#8217;s least discussed commercial feature (Fast Company). Chapter Two is concerned with charting the disciplines applied to the body in Shivers, Rabid and The Fly, while Chapter Three continues a focus on Cronenberg&#8217;s movement and play with framing devices as a means of subverting a stable spectatorial position, utilising eXistenZ, Spider and The Dead Zone as examples. Chapter Four explores the manner with which heretical adherence to a single ideological construction pushes the protagonists towards large-scale disciplinary violations, as detailed in Crash, M. Butterfly and Dead Ringers while the fifth chapter examines notions of discipline and recuperation is focused on Naked Lunch, Scanners and The Brood. A final sixth chapter compares Cronenberg&#8217;s most recent film, A History of Violence, with Videodrome in order to explore the changing face of his disciplinary ambivalence and its relationship to a broader cinematic industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">David Cronenberg</field><field name="subject">Slavoj Zizek</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and choice</field><field name="creator">Alsop, Brent Llewellyn.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies with organoruthenium complexes of substituted arenes</field><field name="creator">Coulson, Sally Anne.</field><field name="description">The modified reactivity observed when a substituted arene is complexed to a cycIopentadienylruthenium moiety has been exploited to prepare a range of synthetically interesting target molecules.

Double nucleophilic substitution reactions between substituted (7 6- 1,2-dichlorw benzene)RuCp+ salts and substituted 1,2-benzenediols were carried out under mild conditions to prepare substituted (q6-dibenzodioxin)ruthenium complexes.

Principal works are of overseas origin; no substantial research has been published relating specifically to the New Zealand economy. This study does not attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of inflation, but has as its purpose the formulation of a simultaneous equation model to explain and predict movements in variables relevant to the inflationary process. The research has been conducted with New Zealand data and no econometric work on inflation yet published seems to have produced a model as embracing as the one advanced. This introduction has the following scope and content. First it conveys some idea of the extent of debate over what inflation is, this being done by brief references to various attempts at defining the phenomenon and to some of the different types of inflation advanced. Next, it questions more fundamentally 'what inflation is, and how, if' at all, the subject may be enlightened by further research. This leads on to derivation of an appropriate definition of inflation. Finally, an outline is given of the aspects of inflation to be investigated and the approach to be adopted.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population structure of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales</field><field name="creator">Olavarria, Carlos</field><field name="description">The humpback whale was almost driven to extinction by commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean. Little is known about the degree of interchange among the remaining Southern Hemisphere populations. This thesis aimed to assess the connectivity among breeding grounds, feeding areas and migratory corridors of humpback whales using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. The population structure of humpback whale populations in breeding grounds across the South Pacific and eastern Indian oceans was investigated, with an interest in the origins of whales in eastern Polynesia, using an extensive collection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (n = 1,112; 470 base pairs in length). Samples were obtained from living whales at six breeding grounds: New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia (Society Islands), Colombia and western Australia. We found significant differentiation, at both the haplotype and nucleotide level, among the six breeding grounds (FST = 0.033; &#934;ST = 0.022) and for most pair-wise comparisons. The differentiation of the eastern Polynesia humpback whales is consistent with the hypothesis of a relic subpopulation, rather than vagrancy or colonization from known neighbouring breeding grounds. Regardless of their origin, it seems probable that islands of eastern Polynesia are now the primary breeding grounds for humpback whales feeding in the management Area VI (170&#176;W &#8211; 120&#176;W) of the Antarctic, as defined by the International Whaling Commission. A population of humpback whales migrates along the western South American coast, with breeding grounds mainly off Colombia and Ecuador and feeding areas off the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the channels and fjords ofsouthern Chile. We analysed the genetic relationship between humpback whales from these two summer feeding areas of the eastern South Pacific population to assess the potential heterogeneity in the migratory pattern of the population. We compared mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from 132 whales from the Antarctic Peninsula and 52 whales from the Magellan Strait areas. An AMOVA showed significant differences between the two feeding areas (FST = 0.180; &#934;ST = 0.169). A phylogenetic analysis showed both areas are represented in the AE clade that is only found in the Southern Hemisphere in the Colombian breeding ground. Genetic and previous demographic data (based on photo-identification) strongly suggest that both feeding areas are related to the same breeding ground but that heterogeneity exists among the feeding areas of this population, similar to that observed in the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations of humpback whales.Humpback whales migrating through eastern Australia and New Zealand have been linked with those breeding off northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga, forming a single stock (Breeding Stock E). We investigated the relationship between the New Caledonian and Tongan breeding grounds, based on interchange of individual whales (genetically identified) and population genetic differentiation (mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and nuclear DNA microsatellites). We found significantly higher recapture probabilities within each breeding ground compared to the recapture probability between them using genetic identification, and significant differences at the population level in the FST and &#934;ST for mitochondrial and nuclear markers. These analyses suggest differentiation among the Breeding Stock E, supporting a proposed sub-stock division for New Caledonia (E2) and Tonga (E3). Historically, humpback whales off New Zealand coasts were caught during their migratory journeys between Antarctic feeding areas and tropical breeding grounds in the South Pacific. Here we investigated the genetic diversity of New Zealand humpback whales, comparing mitochondrial DNA control region sequence data with that from breeding grounds across the South Pacific (New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Colombia) and eastern Indian (western Australia) Oceans. We analyzed 30 samples collected around New Zealand, revealing 20 haplotypes. All haplotypes were found in New Caledonia and some were also found in other breeding grounds. New Zealand humpback whale haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were similar to those from the compared breeding grounds, but were significantly different at haplotype level from the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Colombia breeding grounds. We found significant differences at haplotype level with the same three locations when a pair-wise AMOVA was performed. Three breeding grounds (western Australia, New Caledonia and Tonga) did not show significant differences at either nucleotide or haplotype levels. This genetic evidence and the available demographic data suggest a closer relationship of the New Zealand stock with New Caledonia and to a lesser extent with Tongan whales, supporting New Zealand as a primary migratory corridor for the humpback whales breeding in these western Pacific Islands.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fictionalising the facts : an exploration of the 'place' of Aotearoa/New Zealand in the post-war autobiographical fiction of Anna Kavan</field><field name="creator">Sturm, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ma&#772;ori tribal organisations and new institutional economics</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Marama</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the iwi (M&#257;ori tribal) organisations established in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s to manage resources being transferred as a result of Treaty of Waitangi settlements and the devolution of government services. The research has two objectives. Firstly, it aims to document iwi organisations&#8217; establishment and operation from the viewpoint of those working inside the organisations. Secondly, it compares insider perspectives with economic theories concerning the causes, consequences and development of economic institutions. To address the first objective, the research gathers qualitative data for three iwi organisations and uses these to construct case reports. An inductive comparison across cases finds that while the underlying motivation for creating the iwi organisations is a desire to live as M&#257;ori, the immediate stimuli are opportunities negotiated with government. Iwi are chosen, in preference to other M&#257;ori groups, because of their size and traditional status and organisational success is dependent on meeting the requirements of both members and external parties. To address the second objective, the research examines a number of theories from new institutional economics which assist understanding of the empirical findings. To adequately explain iwi organisations as a whole, however, and to assess the relative explanatory power of the theories, they must be connected into a single explanatory framework. The research constructs a framework using the concept of social capital, understood as the combination of all the socio-economic institutions operating to make collective action possible. The framework proposes that socio-economic institutions can have an influence and value independent of other forms of capital. Viewing new iwi organisations through the constructed theoretical framework casts them as intermediaries, managing relational contracts between tribal members and external parties. The relational contracts with members constitute bonding social capital and are characterised by informal institutions of high intrinsic value, considerable relationship-specific social capital, transferability across tasks but not persons, and a preference for voice over exit. Relational contracts with external parties are primarily instrumental in value and formal institutions play a significant role; they show variability in the importance of informal institutions, relationship-specific social capital, transferability and preference for exit over voice. The thesis presents an insider&#8217;s view of new iwi organisations and then translates this view into the concepts of new institutional economics. In doing so, it contributes to two discussions: first, on the appropriate way to understand new iwi organisations; second, on the appropriate way for new institutional economics to understand society&#8217;s economic institutions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomic biomarker discovery for preeclampsia</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Kelly Rene LeFevre</field><field name="description">Preeclampsia is a serious multisystem complication of late pregnancy with adverse effects for mothers and babies.  Currently this disorder is diagnosed from clinical observations occurring late in the disease process.  Unknown factors in the maternal circulation, possibly released by the preeclamptic placenta, have been linked to the pathophysiological changes characteristic of the disorder.  The research in this thesis used proteomic techniques to identify putative preeclampsia biomarkers from two sources: secreted from a placental cell line undergoing differentiation, and directly sampled from the serum and plasma of women with late-onset preeclampsia. The first part of this research examined the secreted proteome of a placental choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) undergoing forskolin-mediated differentiation.  Development of serum-free culture techniques enabled analysis of these secreted proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE).  Statistical testing revealed the significant involvement of seven spots during this differentiation model, with VE-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 among the proteins identified. In the second part of this research, maternal serum and plasma proteins were compared from women with preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women.  Serum samples were analyzed using 2DE, and plasma was subjected to difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE).  Bioinformatic analysis of both datasets identified multiple spot clusters able to classify samples according to disease state.  Five of these serum proteins were differentially regulated in preeclampsia, including two isoforms of apolipoprotein E whose isoform-specific expression was confirmed using western blots.  Analysis of plasma from preeclamptic women identified six proteins, again including apolipoprotein E.  Proteins from both studies are linked to preeclampsia pathophysiology through lipid transport, complement, and retinol transport systems. The culture methods and secreted proteomic techniques developed in this work have uncovered proteins in a placental cell line and maternal serum and plasma that are associated with preeclampsia. These methods can be extended to any system where secreted proteins are of interest.  The differentially regulated proteins found in this study provide an important first step towards developing effective biomarkers for diagnosing and/or predicting preeclampsia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">proteomics</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic identity and ecology of Bryde's whales in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wiseman, Nicky</field><field name="description">Little long-term research has been conducted in the Hauraki Gulf on Bryde&#8217;s whales; the least studied baleen whale. This thesis investigates this population using photoidentification and sighting records obtained from boat-based opportunistic surveys and genetic analyses of samples from living and `stranded&#8217; whales. Samples from `stranded&#8217; Bryde&#8217;s whales have been collected since 1994 from the North Island of New Zealand. In addition, biopsy samples were collected from whales in the Hauraki Gulf. Fifty-two samples from `stranded&#8217; and biopsied Bryde&#8217;s whales identified 49 unique individuals using 12 polymorphic microsatellites. The sex ratio for both sample collection types were equal with 22 males : 23 females (the sex of four could not be determined). MtDNA D-loop analysis (~800 bp) identified the samples as being consistent with Balaenoptera brydei with 11 haplotypes defined by 16 variable sites. Comparisons with published sequences (373 bp) revealed three shared haplotypes between the North Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, an AMOVA (FST and &#934;ST) showed high levels of differentiation between these oceans, likely resulting from ancestral gene flow. Between March 2001 and February 2006, 1,102 boat-based surveys were conducted during which there were 1,059 sightings over 521 days of Bryde&#8217;s whales (including two birth-length calves) in the Gulf. Since whales with calves, were observed during all months this suggests that the Hauraki Gulf is an important area for breeding whales. The seasonal change in `trip encounter rate&#8217; indicated that some whales leave the Gulf for part of the year. Whales in the Gulf were observed in shallower (12.1 to 59.8 m) and cooler (12 to 24.5oC) water than has generally been reported elsewhere. Balaenoptera brydei corresponds to the form described in the offshore waters of the western North Pacific. In contrast, their habitat use in the Hauraki Gulf was more consistent with the `inshore&#8217; form from the coasts off South Africa.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrodynamic imaging by blind Mexican cave fish</field><field name="creator">Windsor, Shane</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">cave fish</field><field name="subject">Astyanax fasciatus</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamic imaging</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakataukii: Maori sayings</field><field name="creator">McRae, Jane.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Support during Object-Oriented Software Development: The Case of UML Diagrams</field><field name="creator">Costain, Gay</field><field name="description">The Object Management Group (OMG) accepted the Unified Modelling Language (UML) as a standard in 1997, yet there is sparse empirical evidence to justify its choice. This research aimed to address that lack by investigating the modification of programs for which external representations, drawn using the UML notations most commonly used in industry, were provided. The aim of the research was to discover if diagrams using those UML notations provided the modifying programmer with cognitive support.  The application of the use of modelling to assist program modification was chosen as a result of interviews that were carried out in New Zealand and North America to discover how workers in the software industry used modelling, and if so, whether UML notation satisfied their needs. The most preferred UML diagrams were identified from the interviews. A framework of modelling use in software development was derived. A longitudinal study at a Seattle-based company was the source that suggested that program modification should be investigated. The methodology chosen for the research required subjects to modify two non-trivial programs, one of which was supplied with UML documentation. There were two aspects to the methodology. First, the subjects&#8217; performances with and without the aid of UML documentation were compared. Modifying a program is an exercise in problem solving which is a cognitive activity. If the use of UML improved subjects&#8217; performances then it could be said that the UML had aided the subjects&#8217; cognition. Second, concurrent verbal protocols were collected whilst the subjects modified the programs. The protocols for the modification with UML documentation, for ten of the more successful subjects, were transcribed and analysed according to a framework derived from the literature. The framework listed the possible cognitive steps involved in problem solving where cognition could be distributed to and from external representations. The categories of evidence that would confirm cognitive support were also derived from the literature. The experiments confirmed that programmers from similar backgrounds varied widely in ability and style. Twenty programmers modified both an invoice application and a diary application. There was some indication that the UML diagrams aided performance. The analyses of all ten of the transcribed subjects showed evidence of UML cognitive support.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridge deck analysis</field><field name="creator">Buckle, I. G.</field><field name="description">In this thesis the structural analysis of two basic types of bridge deck systems are discussed: 1. the nmltibeam bridge deck II. the skewed anisotropic bridge deck. The major difficulty in the analysis of I, the multibeam deck, arises from its lack of transverse bending stiffness; load distribution occurs by shear transference at interlocking shear keys. An analysis method, developed from transfer matrix theory is proposed and shown to be satisfactory for such a structure. Model studies on a quarter scale multibeam bridge deck are described together with field tests on the prototype decks - the southern motorway bridges crossing Slippery Creek. Agreement between theory, model studies and field tests is illustrated. The satisfactory analysis of II, the skewed anisotropic deck, is complicated by its anistropic elastic properties and skewed geometry. An analysis procedure is introduced which is an extension of the finite element technique already established in other plate bending and plane stress problems. Using therefore the matrix displacement method and finite element discretization, the method has been programmed for solution by digital computer. Comparison of the computed displacements with those obtained by experiment on skewed isotropic and anisotropic steel plates is given. The finite element method is seen to be a powerful analytical tool, particularly because of its ability to handle elastic anisotropy and arbitrary geometric shapes.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of coulomb damping on single and multidegree of freedom structures</field><field name="creator">Mayes, Ronald L.</field><field name="description">This study compares the effects of viscous and coulomb damping on the dynamic response of single and multidegree of freedom structures. It was found that coulomb damping was less effective than viscous damping in reducing the steady-state resonant amplitude of all non-linear structures when the steady-state amplitude was greater than two. Also, there is no single, simple relationship relating the amount of viscous damping to coulomb damping for equal resonant steady-state response of non-linear structures. For the earthquake excitation of the single-degree-of-freedom structure it was found that coulomb damping was less effective than viscous damping in reducing the velocity and displacement spectral response values for short period structures whereas for longer period structures coulomb damping was much more effective than viscous damping. Both forms of damping had a paradoxical effect on the acceleration response of non-linear structures in that an increase in damping generally causes an increase in the acceleration response. The closed solution of a multidegree of freedom structure with viscous and coulomb damping subjected to a sinusoidal forcing function is derived and used to obtain approximate values of viscous and coulomb damping from small amplitude vibration tests. It is clear from the results obtained that if coulomb damping is present in small amplitude vibrations of a structure then the concept of equivalent viscous damping will result in the structure being overdamped when subjected to an earthquake ground motion.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydroelastic excitation of cylinders.</field><field name="creator">Small, Arthur Francis, 1946-</field><field name="description">The transverse vibration of a bluff body in a steady fluid flow is a phenomenon that has been observed and discussed through the ages. Named after the Greek God of Wind Aeolius, the Aeolian Tones, such as are emitted by the wind in telephone or power lines, were known to the Greeks, who produced musical sounds from an Aeolian Harp by hanging it in a current of wind. The first recorded association of the transverse vibration with a periodic wake pattern was made by Leonardo Da Vinci, who observed and sketched the process of alternate periodic vortex shedding from a bluff body to form the staggered vortex trail in its wake. It is unlikely that prior to the nineteenth century many structural failures occurred due to hydrodynamic excitation. Wood, stone and brick were the main construction materials, and the elementary design methods used were very conservative ensuring that the structure had high frequency, large mass and a large damping factor. A very high flow velocity was therefore needed to initiate structural oscillations by vortex shedding and, if initiated these structural oscillations would usually be quickly damped out. During the nineteenth century the rapid advancement in the art of civil engineering design and the introduction and development of concrete and steel as a construction material led to the design of streamlined structures with more economical dimensions and consequently lower frequencies, smaller masses and smaller damping factors. Although design codes made a reasonable allowance for static loadings, dynanic loadings caused by earthquakes and hydrodynamic excitation were eirther ignored or underestimated.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local scour at bridge sites</field><field name="creator">Melville, B. W.</field><field name="description">The problem of local scouring at a circular cylinder in sandy material under threshold conditions was investigated experimentally. The aim of the study was to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism causing scour. Three fixed-bed scour models were constructed: the initial flat-bed model, an intermediate scour model and the final equilibrium scour hole model. The experimental results have shown that although scour is initiated by the high local shear stresses which result from flow acceleration about the cylinder, the subsequent development of the scour hole is due to the establishment of a strong downflow ahead of the cylinder. The scour hole grows in the form of a frustrum of an inverted cone at a slope angle equal to the dynamic angle of repose of the bed material. Erosion occurs in the bottom part of the scour hole. Bed particles from the upper part of the hole slide down into the erosion area as the slope angle is increased by erosion of material from below. The equilibrium depth of scour is attained when the downflow becomes incapable of further erosion. For a particular bed material the downflow should be primarily a function of the mean approach flow velocity and cylinder diameter. Hence the study has shown that the equilibrium depth of scour should also be a function of these two parameters. Additional measurements have shown that the horseshoe vortex, which is initially small, roughly circular in cross-section, and comparatively weak, increases dramatically in size and strength as the scour hole forms. During the development of the scour hole, the horseshoe vortex expands and moves down into the hole, increasing its circulation throughout the scour process, but at a diminishing rate. The shape of the vortex follows that of the scour hole-cylinder combination. Measurements in the wake have added to existing information concerning the shedding and convection of wake vortices in shear flow. The results obtained are consistent with the occurence of span-wise cells of constant shedding frequency, separated at the discontinuities by longitudinal vortices. The vortices accelerate away from the cylinder at speeds initially less than the free stream but becoming constant and approximately equal to the free stream velocity at about 8  cylinder diameters downstream. Based upon a survey of existing material, a design recommendation for the estimation of local scour depths at bridge piers is also presented.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viscoelastic response of polyethylene to temperature and pressure</field><field name="creator">Dao, Kim Chung, 1941-</field><field name="description">Specimens of high-density low-density polyethylene were uniaxially compressed at nominally constant strain-rates ranging from 0.000066 to 0.66 sec-1 at temperatures from 77&#176; to 350&#176;K and hydrostatic pressures from 0.001(latm) to 4 K bar. It was shown that there were significant effects of temperature, pressure and strain rate on both polyethylenes. At small strains (O.O1), the time-temperature and time-pressure superpositions were used successfully to construct the master curves of stress versus reduced strain-rate. These master curves, which were found to have been taken in the range of linear-viscoelastic behaviour of the polymers, were employed to derive the stress-relaxation moduli and the relaxation spectra. The viscoelastic response to temperature and pressure of high-density polyethylene in the transition zone between the &#947; and &#945; relaxations, and that of low-density polyethylene in the transition zone between the &#947; and &#946; relaxations have been found to be controlled by the same molecular motion.

The program was initiated primarily to provide a variety of topics for post-graduate research in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and at the same time to develop a useful radio telescope installation. Initial work was concentrated on the development of antenna arrays (Lim, 1968) and low noise receivers at a frequency of 42MHz, utilising both phase-switched and correlation interferometer principles (Irving, 1966; Yarrall, 1968; Saunders, 1968). At the beginning of 1969, the Department moved from its former country site into the centre of Auckland city. As no alternative field site was available, the telescope was also moved, but space limitations meant that the city site was inadequate for any useful observations at 42MHz. It became clear that to utilise the site more fully a higher observation frequency would be necessary, and a frequency of 200MHz was chosen, as this was the upper limit of most of the available laboratory equipment, yet still within the range of semiconductor devices. In view of the inadequacies of the site, it was obvious that the performance of the system could be significantly improved by processing the output in a digital computer.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate)</field><field name="creator">Meikle, John Boyd, 1940-</field><field name="description">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate) have been examined by means of constant strain-rate tests at differing strain-rates and temperatures.

It was aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of deformation, using optical microscopy to examine slip habits and transmission electron microscopy to examine dislocation substructures. Marked differences were observed in the stress/strain response, slip behaviour, and the substructural rearrangements of single crystals of &#946;-brass when widely different rates of uninterrupted compressive loading were used. Under static loading (strain rates = 10-4 sec-1) the crystals workhardened in a parabolic manner, slip being confined to either of the two (101) [111] or (211) [111] systems. Cross-slip in the statically deformed crystals was evidenced by the wavy appearance of the slip traces. Under dynamic loading (strain rates &gt; 103 sec-1) the crystals exhibited large yield drops followed by a linear rate of work-hardening which was lower than the static work-hardening rate. Slip on the four (-101) [111], (-110) [111], (101) [-11l] and (110) [-111] systems occurred simultaneously. The traces on any one dynamically deformed specimen were both coarser and finer than those observed on specimens statically deformed. The coarse traces belonging to a given {110} &lt;111&gt; slip system always bounded the finer traces of another {110} &lt;111&gt; system. No wavy slip was observed on the dynamically deformed specimens. The substructures present in the statically deformed crystals were consistent with a single mode of slip and exhibited features indicative of high rates of hardening on the active slip planes. The important features of the statically induced substructures were as follows:- (a) There was a predominance of dislocations with Burgers vectors of a[111]. Many of these lay in non-screw high-energy orientations, consistent with the occurrence of cross-slip and the observed high hardening rates of the crystals. (b) Strong tangling developed on the slip planes as a result of a[111] edge segments interacting with other a[111] segments and with loop and dipole debris produced on the slip planes. (c) A partially developed cell structure resulted from this tangling. The dynamically induced substructures were consistent with the simultaneous operation of the four {110} &lt;111&gt; slip systems. It was inferred from the substructural investigations that the lower rates of hardening in the dynamically deformed crystals arose from the distribution of slip over the four systems with a consequent reduction in hardening on each individual system. The interactions between dislocations on intersecting slip planes appeared to be less important in contributing to hardening than the influence of the four systems in reducing the hardening on any one system. A series of interrupted tests indicated that behaviour under staticstatic, dynamic-dynamic and dynamic-static loading sequences was consistent with the uninterrupted static and dynamic behaviour, but that the dynamic reload stress/strain and slip behaviour, and the associated substructural changes were greatly modified by static preloading. The crystals deformed by a "static" type slip mechanism, but exhibited "dynamic" type stress/strain behaviour during the dynamic reload in this sequence.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multivariate analysis of non-linear hydrologic systems</field><field name="creator">Bidwell, V.

M.</field><field name="description">An investigation is made into the coupled lateral-torsional response of torsionally unbalanced &#8220;shear&#8221; buildings to horizontally directed earthquake excitation. Attention is confined to analytical models that have linearly elastic, viscously damped responses. The investigation involves three separate analyses: Firstly, in a preliminary study, the earthquake response of an asymmetric single storey building model is analyzed and general expressions are derived for the location of the centre of stiffness and the orientation of the principal axes. Secondly, an analysis is made of the coupled lateral-torsional response of a partially symmetric single storey building model to a single component of earthquake excitation. A modal solution of the two equations of motion is developed and a general criterion is derived for the existence of full modal coupling. By employing the design spectrum concept, together with conservative rules for the combination of modal maxima, analytical results in dimensionless form are evaluated for an equivalent static shear and an equivalent static torque. The combination expressions are then modified to include an allowance for modal coupling before the final results are computed and tabulated. The results substantiate previous findings which have pointed to a possible link between strong modal coupling and severely coupled lateral and torsional responses. In particular, they indicate that those nominally symmetric buildings which exhibit strong modal coupling are liable to respond more strongly in torsion than has hitherto been recognised by most building codes. This effect has not in the past been quantified in analytical terms. Although the results have practical applications in design, the analysis concerns itself primarily with the determination of realistic estimates for the dimensionless response quantities and no attempt is made to derive design rules. Finally, the partially symmetric single storey model is extended to a special class of partially symmetric multistorey "shear" buildings. The importance of this final analysis derives from the similarity between the results for the single storey model and those for the continuous multistorey model.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The simulation of water quality in the Waikato and Tarawera rivers.</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, J.

The equations governing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a polluted waterway are developed and a review is made of the various finite difference schemes which available for solving them. Models are developed for predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in two polluted New Zealand rivers, the Waikate and the Tarawera. It was found that the models used previously in other waterways were not adequate for either of these rivers. The model of the Waikato River uses the well-known Streeter-phelps equation to model the exertion of BOD but includes the effects of the macrophyte and phytoplankton communities on the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The model of the Tarawera River uses the Monod equations to predict the concentrations of active biomass in the porous pumice sediments on the river bed, and successfully accounts for the high rate of oxygen uptake which has been observed.

The first part of the investigation required the development of the basic apparatus for investigations of the type envisaged. This apparatus included a tensile testing-machine, apparatus for the production of meta1 single crystals, apparatus for the determination of the orientation of metal single crystals and apparatus for the strain-free machining of metal single crystals. Details of the design and construction of this apparatus are presented. The second part of the investigation required the assessing of the existing knowledge of work-hardening and the establishment of a programme aimed at contributing further to this knowledge. A review is presented of information which pertains to the results of interrupted tensile tests such as those where the temperature dependence of the flow stress is examined, or the yield phenomenon produced by unloading is examined. Some omissions and anomalies in this information are noted and a programme of interrupted tests of the types described in the review is outlined for polycrystalline copper. As a result of this programme, the following conclusions are made concerning the work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing: (a) polycrystalline copper obeys the Cottrell-Stokes law irrespective of the grain size or purity. (b) copper single crystals of polyslip orientations obey the Cottrell-Stokes law. (c) polycrystalline copper exhibits a yield phenomenon produced by unloading at all temperatures and strains. The magnitude of the change in flow stress associated with the yield phenomenon increases with decreasing temperature and is not significantly dependent on grain-size or purity. The magnitude of the change in flow stress increases with increasing strain and passes through a maximum. (d) the magnitude of the change in flow stress associated with the yield phenomenon produced by unloading in polycrystalline copper increases as the amount of unloading increases.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the flow properties of New Zealand wood pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Geoffrey G.</field><field name="description">One of the most important process operations in the pulp and paper industry is the transport of pulp in pipe lines. Because pipe friction losses are much higher than with water under comparable conditions, accurate design correlations for each pulp are important to the industry. The purpose of this investigation was to design and build a flow rig suitable for investigating a wide range of pulp conditions, to obtain pipe friction loss data for New Zealand pulps, and to produce design correlations and procedures for the industry. This thesis is therefore concerned primarily with describing the experimental equipment and procedures, presenting pipe friction loss data for a variety of New Zealand pulps, including a design correlation for them, and developing design methods for computing friction losses. It includes, in addition, data on drag reduction observed at high velocities of flow, and a discussion of flow mechanisms in each regime of flow. The equipment was designed to produce friction loss data from three pipe diameters simultaneously for each consistency of pulp. Flow rate was controlled without throttling the flow. Pipe friction loss data are presented for five Kraft pulps and one neutral sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Data were obtained from 1,2,3 and 4 in. diameter PVC pipes for a wide range of consistencies and flow rates up to 0.8 ft3/sec. Standard Lampen mill evaluations on hand sheets made from the pulps are presented, as well as data on the characteristics of the fibres. The Kraft pulps exhibited the characteristic maxima and minima but the semi-chemical pulp did not exhibit these turning points. For Kraft pulps head losses before the respective maxima were increased by refining the pulp and using rough pipe; and decreased by adding short-fibre Tawa and by drying and reslushing the pulp. In comparison with maxima for the unbeaten Kraft Pulp, the maxima of the head loss curves for all Kraft pulps were shifted to lower velocities by the above-mentioned operations. This would reduce the friction loss in many practical cases. In particular, rough pipe lowers the magnitude of friction loss in this regime, and can therefore yield a considerable economic advantage. A single design correlation for Kraft pulps is presented for the regime of flow before the maxima in the head loss curves. The limits of the correlation are given. Friction losses of New Zealand pulps were found to be lower than those previously reported in the literature. Two methods of design are presented for the regimes at velocities above the maxima in the head loss curves. A procedure is suggested for pulp and paper mills to obtain their own limits for the design correlation and to verify the correlation proposed in this investigation for their own pulps. A design correlation for the Tawa NSSC pulp is also presented. Mechanisms of flow are discussed for Kraft pulps and a semi-chemical pulp. Visual observations in an artificially roughened pipe for the regime of flow before the maxima of the head loss curves have confirmed fibre-wall contact in this regime. Data obtained at the first sign of permanent plug disruption have been correlated with data at the onset of drag reduction. Fully developed turbulence was found to occur at the maximum level of drag reduction. Some velocity profiles are reported for the transition regime using a modified annular-purge probe. In addition the disruptive shear stress of fibre networks has been correlated by three different methods. Data for the onset of drag reduction are presented and compared with data previously obtained from large diameter pipes from other investigations. This correlation is used as a method for designing piping systems at high flow rates.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress-strain and strength properties of an Auckland residual soil</field><field name="creator">Meyer, V.

The study was concerned with an estimation of the maximum possible peak-to-peak amplitude of simple idealised models subjected to pulses of a sinusoidal nature. The study was mainly centred around the maximum response of the single degree of freedom elastoplastic system and the effect upon it of viscous damping and a transition region between the elastic and plastic states. The extension of the approach to the two degree of freedom elastoplastic system was also investigated. The study was undertaken within the context of the earthquake engineering field. The investigation shows up certain basic characteristics of the transient response of fully yielding structures which appear to be common for widely varying types of exciting function. It also shows that the response of fully yielding structures to earthquake motions is probably a function of the characteristics of the largest pulses of an earthquake. A brief review of the study of the inelastic response of structures in the earthquake engineering context is also presented.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new vision interface : "defining what instead of how" : making image analysis functions transparent to the user by coupling them to handling tasks in an intuitive interface for materials handling applications</field><field name="creator">Sly, Ian M. P.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the need for adaptability in vision systems that measure system state information in a sensory feedback role for the control and coordination of flexible discreteitem materials handling operations, such as those performed by a robotic palletising system. In addition, this thesis addresses the need for vision systems that are more easily configured by users, such as factory technicians and operators, who have lower skill levels than those generally required to (re-)configure a machine vision system. In response, a unique coupling mechanism and intuitive human-computer interface have been developed, hiding the complexity of image analysis from the end-user and simplifying the way that a machine vision system is configured. The mechanism couples machine vision-related "visual checks&#8221; to materials handling tasks in a generic framework of materials handling activities. Visual checks which define what control information is required are implicitly linked to image analysis functions which define how that information is extracted from digitised images of a materials handling system. Consequently, this research has developed a set of task - visual check "building blocks" that can be used in various combinations to define the sequence of actions and image analysis required to perform a variety of materials handling operations. In addition, a number of pre-defined task &#8211; visual check combinations and mechanisms for manipulating them have been developed, providing solution templates that can be used immediately or modified to suit application-specific requirements. These developments have been realised together with several aesthetic, ergonomic and functional features in a machine vision configuration interface, known as SlyVision. SlyVision's modularity, extensibility and upgradeability expressed to both the end-user and the system developer through its underlying object oriented architecture and intuitive user interface design make important contributions to its overall adaptability. Demonstrations involving a typical palletising and a de-palletising operation have shown how SlyVlsion is used to specify visual checks and configure the associated machine vision components without requiring the end-user to select or apply image analysis techniques or functions. In addition, the relative simplicity of the configuration process is demonstrated. Consequently, these developments assist people with limited understanding of machine vision technology to set up and maintain a vision system, thereby improving their ability to keep pace with frequent changes in their materials handling operations, while limiting the cost in time, money and effort required to (re-)configure a vision system.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of microstructure on the fracture toughness of a high strength steel</field><field name="creator">Clark, N. E.</field><field name="description">The relationship between heat treatment, microstructure, fracture topography and room temperature fracture toughness has been determined for a high strength low-alloy steel, En 25. 0ptical, transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure and morphology while fracture toughness, notched impact and tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties. The as-quenched microstructure was predominantly autotempered lath martensite. A little retained austenite was observed in all as-quenched martensite. Austenitizing at 1200&#176;C instead of the conventional 850&#176;C resulted in a 30 percent increase in as-quenched fracture toughness with no loss in tensile strength. Step quenching from 1200 to 850&#176;C for 15 minutes before oil quenching resulted in embrittlement of the austenite grain boundaries and consequently a loss of fracture toughness. The superior fracture toughness of the coarse grain l200&#176;C material was maintained for tempers up to 200&#176;C. Severe intergranular embrittlement and a considerable reduction in toughness were observed when the coarse grain 1200&#176;C material was tempered in the 300-400&#176;C tempered martensite embrittlement range. The fine grain 850&#176;C material also exhibited a drop in toughness in the 300-400&#176;C tempering range but in this case the fracture mode was mainly transgranular cleavage. Transgranular cleavage fracture was tentatively associated with the precipitation of lath boundary cementite, Fe3C. Tempering the fine grain material above 400&#176;C eliminated cleavage and brittle intergranular fracture and resulted in a significant increase in toughness. A little brittle intergranular fracture was observed in the coarse grain material tempered at 500&#176;C. The transverse fracture toughness for material of yield strength less than 1200 MPa was controlled by the major MnS stringer population. The fracture profile was zig-zag, each peak or trough terminating at a MnS stringer. A shear fracture mechanism has been proposed to account for the observed zig-zag fracture mode. The longitudinal fracture toughness was significantly greater than the transverse fracture toughness for tempers of 400&#176;C and above. Mixed microstructures containing lower bainite and martensite did not have inferior relative toughness to wholly martensitic structures. Relationships were found between relative toughness and yield strength and relative toughness and shear lip thickness. There was no meaningful relationship between notched bar impact and fracture toughness data.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between fracture toughness and shear lip size</field><field name="creator">Lai, M.

The size of the shear lips, BSL, measured at the free surfaces of the specimens was found to be independent of the specimen thickness and to be related to the true plane strain fracture toughness, KIC, through the expression BSL = 0.41(KIC/&#963; ys)2.02, where &#963;ys is the 0.2% proof stress of the material. A rationale for this behaviour is that BSL is approximately equal to the size of the plane stress plastic zone, ry, at the surfaces of a plate specimen, which from theoretical analysis, has been shown to be rY = &#928;/8(KIC/&#963;YS)2. The ASTM standard plane strain fracture toughness test method has been proven to be insensitive to detect excess yielding in the specimens tempered at temperatures higher than 450&#176;C. At high tempers, yielding fracture mechanics approaches were used to determine the true KIC values. The fracture toughness versus shear lip size relationship is believed to have considerable importance in the analysis of service failures and in the preliminary study of specimen size effect in plane strain fracture toughness determination.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semi-rigid joints for moment-resisting steel framed seismic-resisting systems</field><field name="creator">Clifton, George Charles, 1955-</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of new semi-rigid joints for moment-resisting steel framed (MRSF) seismic-resisting systems. Intended as the weak link in the seismic-resisting system, in accordance with a strong column, weak joint philosophy, the joints and systems were designed and detailed to withstand the design level ultimate limit state (500 year return period) earthquake with minimum damage. To meet economic criteria, the joints and systems were also required to be cost-effective to design, fabricate and construct when compared with conventional MRSFS. Four joint systems between the beams and columns of a MRSF were considered. These were the: Ring Spring Joint (RSJ), where the beams are clamped to the columns with flush endplates and compressible ring spring elements Post-tensioned Tendon Joint (PTJ), where the beams are post-tensioned onto the columns with post-tensioning technology Flange Bolted Joint (FBJ), where the beams are bolted to the columns through flange and web plates that are designed and detailed to undergo dependable cyclic extension and compression under inelastic rotation demand Sliding Hinge Joint (SHJ), where the beam is pinned to the column at the top flange level and is connected at the bottom flange and the bottom of the web by a unique asymmetrical sliding shear detail The RSJ, FBJ and SHJ were developed through to the experimental stage, with large-scale tests on representative joints undertaken. The FBJ and SHJ were further developed, through small-scale static and dynamic testing, finite element and numerical integration time-history analyses into fully designed and detailed systems. Design procedures and detailing requirements for the two fully developed systems are presented, together with details of experimental testing, finite element analyses of joint components and numerical integration time-history analyses of complete structural systems. Design and detailing requirements for the joints and the frames are covered and fully worked design examples for the Flange Bolted and Sliding Hinge Joints are presented. The results demonstrate that the semi-rigid, strength-limited joints developed, when used in properly designed moment-resisting steel frames, have considerable advantages over conventional rigidly jointed frames for meeting strength, stiffness, ductility, damage-resistance and economic criteria.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulphuric acid, oxygen pressure leaching of a base-metal sulphide ore</field><field name="creator">Tegg, G. J.</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis was the initial phase of an experimental programme initiated in 1969 at Auckland University to study the application of hydrometallurgical techniques to the recovery of base-metals from New Zealand sulphide ores. The principal aim was to design and build a suitable autoclave for conducting pressure leaching experiments and with this to evaluate the sulphuric acid leaching kinetics of a bulk lead-zinc-copper-iron concentrate, under a range of experimental conditions that might have process potential. The effects of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration, excess or deficiency of acid, initial particulate surface area, agitation, catalyst additions (cupric and ferric sulphate) and time on the rate of leaching of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and pyrite were investigated. Galena was found to dissolve with the formation of hydrogen sulphide and lead sulphate. The hydrogen sulphide inhibited the dissolution of both sphalerite and chalcopyrite but not galena. The effect of experimental variables on the rate of oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to sulphur are reported. This reaction was found to take place on the surface of sulphide particles between adsorbed species and the rate determining step was the oxidation of adsorbed ferrous ions by dissolved oxygen. Scanning electron micrographs are presented which show that the lead sulphate forms as a non-coherent crystalline layer on the galena surface. Conversion reaction kinetics were consistent with rate control by liquid phase diffusion in the pores of this layer. The rate of conversion was independent of oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration and hydrodynamics but was directly proportional to the initial particulate surface area. A very low temperature dependence was exhibited. Sphalerite was found to exhibit linear leaching kinetics up to extractions of eighty percent after reaction inhibiting hydrogen sulphide had been removed by oxidation. The rate of linear leaching was directly proportional to oxygen partial pressure and surface area but independent of acid concentration and hydrodynamics. The ultimate sulphide oxidation products were elemental sulphur and sulphate ions with the former usually accounting for over ninety percent of the reacted sulphide sulphur. The dissolution reaction producing sulphur was electrochemical in nature and the cathodic reaction involving the discharge of oxygen was found to be rate controlling. Soluble iron catalysed this reaction and a mechanism is proposed that involves the chemisorption of ferrous ions and dissolved oxygen at the mineral surface. Scanning electron micrographs are presented which show that certain crystal faces are preferentially attacked and that dissolution occurs by a pitting action. They also explain why sphalerite dissolution is severely curtailed at temperatures exceeding the meltinq point of sulphur. For extractions exceeding eighty percent the dissolution rate decreased rapidly due to a decrease in cathodic area and to the agglomeration of residues. Chalcopyrite and pyrite dissolved much more slowly than sphalerite and were extensively coated by elemental sulphur because the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide was catalysed on their surfaces. Some practical implications of the leaching results are discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of streaming on thermoacoustic systems</field><field name="creator">Starr, Rhys Adam</field><field name="description">Although the current thermoacoustic theory has so far proved successful in allowing us to analyse and understand thermoacoustic systems, there are inherent limitations associated with it. These are related to the fact that this theory is based on linear approximations. As designers search for ways to increase the efficiency and power density of thermoacoustic devices the accuracy of the linear theory decreases significantly, as a variety of non-linear effects start to become important. For example, when the pressure amplitude is increased, in order to increase the power density. This thesis concentrates on the non-linear effect of acoustic streaming. Acoustic streaming is a steady flow that is superimposed upon the acoustic Oscillations. An expression for the streaming velocity is developed for a parallel plate channel having an arbitrary gap width, so that the solution is valid for both thin and wide boundary layers. The solution includes thermal effects arising from the presence of an axial temperature gradient along the channel, and arbitrary phase between the pressure and velocity. An essential feature of the streaming velocity is the generation of circulating loops, which can cause heat to be convected within the channel. An expression for the transverse steady state temperature was also derived, for similar conditions as outlined for the streaming velocity. It was found that when an axial temperature gradient is present the magnitude of the transverse steady state temperature increases significantly as the width of the channel increases. The implication of this is that a significant amount of heat can be convected along the channel due to the action of the streaming velocity. When no axial temperature gradient is present, the transverse steady state temperature reduces to a small constant value outside the boundary layer. A numerical finite difference scheme was developed to model non-linear flow within the two-dimensional channel. The model solves for the conjugate fluid-solid problem enabling the temperature difference induced along the channel to be predicted. The model compared very well to experimental data. It was also found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions for the streaming velocity and the transverse steady state temperature. The effect of streaming on the energy flux density was examined for a wide channel, having a temperature gradient along its length. A fourth-order expression was developed, which yielded a solution in terms of the transverse steady state temperature and second-order mass flux, which for certain conditions could be of a similar magnitude as the second-order terms. For a thermoacoustic core, it was proposed that a toroidal flow could form and convect heat from one heat exchanger to the other. To analysis this effect toroidal flow was incorporated into an expression for the temperature difference induced across a thermoacoustic couple. This result was found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. The effect of toroidal streaming on the thermoacoustic core was also considered. In addition, a second-order expression for the work flux was derived that included a previously ignored term due to acoustic streaming.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The propagation of seismic waves through nonlinear soil media</field><field name="creator">Larkin, T. J. (Thomas J.)</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with a theoretical, laboratory and in situ investigation of the propagation of seismic stress waves through soil media. Analyses are carried out to predict the surface response that results from earthquake motions being transmitted through the upper layers of the earth. The nature of the near surface geological layers affect to a marked degree the intensity of surface motion. The mathematical models presented are used in the evaluation of site response to earthquakes. The theoretical methods used depart from the traditional viscoelastic approach and use a nonlinear hysteretic soil model to describe the complex dynamic stress-strain relationships evident in soil response. The dynamic soil model is based on previous laboratory work carried out at this university. The theoretical solutions formulated are limited to one-dimensional situations. Three methods of analysis are presented for the propagation of seismic shear waves through nonlinear soil media and conclusions are drawn as to the best approach. The results of these analyses are generally significantly different from those obtained using a viscoelastic soil model. Seismic dilatational waves are also considered important and a method is presented to calculate the response of hysteretic soil media to these disturbances. The outcome from these dilatational and shear wave analyses is more accurate surface response spectra for use in aseismic structural design.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Dosage Rate on The Chemical and Sensory Changes Occurring During Micro-oxygenation of New Zealand Red Wine</field><field name="creator">Dykes, Stuart</field><field name="description">The technique of micro-oxygenation involves the deliberate addition of continuous, metered amounts of oxygen into a vessel of bulk wine during the maturation period (between the end of fermentation and bottling).  The aim of the process is to improve the sensory properties of red wine, particularly the mouthfeel characteristics associated with the various polyphenol constituents.  The success of the process appears to depend strongly on the ability to control the rate of oxygen dosage.  The effect of dosage rate on the chemical and corresponding sensory changes of a red wine is the central theme of this thesis.  A method of dosing oxygen (at typical micro-oxygenation rates) into small volumes of wine (&lt;100 litres) was developed using a dense polymer membrane diffuser.  It was clearly demonstrated that wine could be reliably oxygenated at very low rates using a coiled length of FEP as the diffuser material.  Oxygen dosage was regulated by adjusting the oxygen pressure inside the tube.  The advantage with a dense polymer diffuser is that no bubbles are generated and the oxygenation efficiency is 100%.  The diffuser was fully modeled and characterised for use in the laboratory scale trials detailed in Chapters Four and Six.   The small scale oxygenation equipment was used to conduct a fully replicated experiment to investigate the evolution of a Cabernet Sauvignon wine under four oxygenation treatments at dosage rates of 0, 10, 23 and 36 mg/L/mth.  The total period of the trial was 105 days.  HPLC analysis indicated that the rate change of low molecular weight polyphenols is directly related to the oxygen dosage rate.  The concentration of the majority of the identifiable monomers, most notably the anthocyanins decreased throughout the course of the trial.  The rate of decrease was directly related to oxygen dosage rate.  Thiolysis results showed an increase in mDP for all treatments over the course of the trial until day 77 when they were observed to decrease for all treatments.  The decrease in mDP coincided with an addition of SO2 which was investigated in a subsequent trial.  Spectrophotometric results indicated that the rate of formation of non-bleachable pigments was directly related to the rate of oxygen dosage with significant differences between the high rates (23 and 36 mg/L/mth) and the low rates (0 and 10 mg/L/mth).  The trend for all treatments was for increased levels of stable pigments.  The sensory results show that the measured organoleptic temporal development exhibits a similar oscillatory behaviour compared to the anecdotally derived curve presented in figure 1-2.  The distinction between the respective phases described in section 1.1.1 was, however less clear.  The most significant factor in the model weighting was mouthfeel and astringency which correlates with the observed changes occurring in the wine polypenols during maturation.  Overall the laboratory scale trial showed that the chemical polyphenol development was directly related to the oxygen dosage rate.  The sensory evolution also appeared to be accelerated with higher oxygen dosage rates, although the oscillatory nature of the sensory response given a single linear input indicates a complex underlying mechanism driving the changes.  The effect of SO2 on the development of wine polyphenols with and without oxygen was also investigated.   The presence of SO2 was found to have a significant effect on both mDP and the concentration of non-bleachable pigments.  mDP was observed to decrease over the six week trial period irrespective of whether oxygen had been added or not.  The mDP for the treatments without SO2 increased steadily over the course of the trial.  Similarly the formation of non-bleachable pigments was suppressed and even retarded with SO2 present whereas for the treatments without SO2 a steady increase was observed.  The implication of these results is that SO2 may have a much larger effect on tannin development than oxygen. The use of electrochemical micro-oxidation (or ELMOX) was examined ostensibly to determine proof of concept and also compare the performance of glassy carbon and titanium as electrode materials against traditional micro-oxygenation.   Notable transformations occurred with titanium showing higher levels of ethanal than the other treatments both chemically and by sensory measure.  A greater rate of stable pigment formation was also observed for the titanium compared to the other treatments.  The respective dosage rates for the glassy carbon ELMOX and traditional micro-oxygenation treatments were too low to be able to discriminate any significant differences compared to the control wine.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Micro-oxygenation</field><field name="subject">Red Wine</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">wine oxidation</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elastic analysis of soil media.</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Graham</field><field name="description">Elastic Solutions can be used to predict stresses and displacements in loaded soil media provided the non-linear stress-strain behaviour of the soil is recognised and allowance made for it in calculating displacements. This thesis examines the methods of elastic analysis suitable for examining problems in Soil Mechanics and the determination of suitable stress-strain parameters. The use of the Finite Element method in Soil Mechanics is reviewed, and a computer program for examining linear elastic plane stress and plane strain problems is presented. The program has been used to examine a range of problems involving infinitely long excavations of rectangular cross-section in the surface of a stratum overlying a rigid base. The excavations were analysed for a uniform vertical loading in the base of the excavation and for lateral wall loads representing the effect of the release of the insitu stresses during excavation. Cases in which the lateral movement of the walls is completely restrained are also considered, and the effect of wall restraint on the vertical displacements due to the vertical base loading is shown to be small. Results obtained by the author suggest that care should be exercised in the use of the Finite Element method to analyse problems involving loaded rigid footings or the stresses behind rigid retaining walls, and that the solutions in these cases may be inaccurate. The solutions available for surface loadings on layered elastic strata are reviewed and results obtained from a Fourier Series approach are presented for a range of problems involving surface loadings on a single rigid base elastic stratum. Uniform vertical and horizontal strip loadings and rigid strip footings with vertical, horizontal and moment loadings are considered. A uniform vertical strip load on the surface of a multilayer stratum overlying a half space or rigid base is also analysed. The computer programs and full mathematical derivations for the strip loading cases are presented, and the extension of the solutions to rectangular loadings is discussed and the basic mathematical derivations outlined. The application of the Fourier Series solutions to the calculation of consolidation settlements is discussed. Work by other investigators suggests that a hyperbolic model may be suitable for approximating soil stress-strain curves and that fundamental stress-strain behaviour should be examined in tests in which the bulk stress remains constant during the application of the shear stress. Equipment designed to carry out slow drained triaxial tests in which the bulk stress is constant during the shearing phase is described, and the results of a short series of tests used to proof test the equipment are presented.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of wave runup on breakwaters</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Gavin Noel</field><field name="description">The design of rubble mound breakwaters is typically based on empirical formulae and physical modelling. One limitation of this approach is that different aspects of wave interaction with a breakwater, such as the elevation of the runup tip and armour stability, are treated separately. Therefore the development of a numerical model of wave runup on a rubble mound breakwater was the primary objective of the research described in this thesis. Because of the range of slope conditions encountered with rubble mound breakwaters and revetments, two types of armour layer are considered. The first is impermeable and so only the flow within the external region is modelled. The flow is assumed to be governed by the unsteady one-dimensional shallow water wave equations and only regular waves are considered. It is shown how the use of the finite element method with a mesh of isoparametric elements that deforms and is fitted to the runup tip has a number of advantages over the traditional use of the finite difference method with a fixed grid. Reasonably good results were obtained for the numerical modelling of wave runup on a riprap armoured l:3 impermeable slope indicating that the numerical model may, in conjunction with a physical model, be of practical use in the design of revetments. Wave runup on smooth and Dolos armoured 1:1.5 impermeable slopes was modelled poorly. Therefore the model is more appropriate for wave runup on a revetment than a rubble mound breakwater. The second type of armour layer is permeable and so the flow within the external region and armour layer is modelled simultaneously by coupling numerical models for the respective regions. It is concluded that this approach is unlikely to give acceptable results for the runup of regular waves on a steep, permeable armour layer unless it also accounts for the non-hydrostatic distribution of pressure within the external region. An experiment is described in which continuous time histories of wave runup and dynamic pressure due to regular waves on smooth and Dolos armoured 1:1.5 slopes were measured. The results are used to discuss the assumption of hydrostatic pressure. A method of assessing armour stability requirements which takes into consideration the effects of armour unit interaction is proposed. It is recommended that this is examined further.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Site response to earthquakes with reference to the application of microtremor measurements.</field><field name="creator">Parton, Ian M.</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that some areas of the earth's surface are more prone to earthquake occurrence than others. Furthermore, within these earthquake-prone area the distribution of earthquake epicentres is non-uniform. Ttis has led to a system of regional zoning for earthquake resistant design in most countries. Observations of localised damage resulting from earthquakes has only recently led to the general acceptance of the fact that the degree of damage may be influenced by the characteristics of the soils in the affected area. Where the damage is related to gross instability of the soil resulting in large permanent deformations, association of the damage with local soil conditions is readily apparent. A somewhat less obvious effect of soil conditions on building damage is that subsurface soil layering can influence the intensity of ground shaking, and the frequency content of the surface motion, even though the soils underlying structures may remain perfectly stable during an earthquake. The frequency characteristics of the surface motion are important as the existence of a predominant ground frequency may lead to resonance of structures during prolonged shaking. In Chapter 2 a brief resume of existing knowledge of the occurrence, origin and nature of earthquakes is presented. Basic wave models and wave types are outlined.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dual channel solar radiometer</field><field name="creator">Wakeman, Philip E.

Particular attention has been paid, in the choice of receiving system and the design of its components, to the avoidance and reduction of interference. The system used is a two receiver multiplying interferometer with the addition of phase switching. A computer controlled phase cancelling system is used to make the interferometer fringe track the source (i.e the sun), thereby producing a rectified output. An outline of the design of comb-line filters is given. These low loss transmission filters are used at the receiver inputs to attenuate strong out of band interfering signals. Operational amplifiers are used to gain stabilize the RF preamplifiers. Very low sensitivity of gain to temperature change is shown to result from the use of this technique. The system incorporates an analogue magnetic tape recorder so that signals of interest can be replayed for paper strip chart recording at high speed. The recording system has the feature that time of day information is recorded automatically in conjunction with the receiver signals.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of basecourse saturation on flexible pavement performance.</field><field name="creator">Toan, Do Van</field><field name="description">It is recognised that saturation of an unbound granular basecourse may lead to the premature failure of flexible asphalt pavements. Basecourse saturation results in increased flexural strains in the asphaltic layer and increased rutting leading to cracking of the surface layer. To obtain a physical and quantitative understanding of the deformation characteristics of saturated granular basecourse materials and the associated failure mechanisms of the pavement structure, laboratory testing equipment was developed including an automated kneading compactor, dynamic triaxial apparatus and a constant head permeameter. Tests were carried out on 250 mm diameter compacted samples of a basaltic aggregate having a maximum particle size of 38 mm. Dynamic tests were performed on both unsaturated and saturated samples. Characterisation tests established variations in resilient moduli and Poisson&#8217;s ratio with deviator and confining stress for use in multi-layer elastic analyses. The results of a testing program where samples were subjected to stress states simulating traffic loading, indicated that saturation approximately doubles resilient deformations and increases creep rates by as much as a factor of 10. These changes are caused by loss of capillary stress on saturation and increases in dynamic pore water pressures as a result of applied lateral pressures. A fundamental relationship between the creep rate and the resilient strain amplitude was established, and provides a simple key for the comparative study of different aggregates and the assessment of rut depths in design applications. To assess the effects of dissipation on the magnitude of the dynamic pore water pressures in a pavement structure, a permeability study was carried out on compacted basecourse samples. The permeability characteristics measured were used in a computer analysis to establish the effects of dissipation. Graphs were established showing the effects of permeability and traffic speed on the pore water pressure response. The permeability tests also showed that fines were transported at hydraulic gradients in excess of l resulting in clogging of pore channels and large reductions in permeability. Comparative analyses were carried out to assess the response of saturated and unsaturated pavement sections using the deformation characteristics established in conjunction with a multi-layered elastic computer program. Results of the analyses indicated that the increase in rut depth due to basecourse creep deformation may be 100 times larger for a saturated pavement compared to an unsaturated pavement.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element for the elastic stability analysis of frameworks.</field><field name="creator">Davidson, B.

The bracing requirements of these trusses are compared with the requirements of the bracing to pinned columns, which are the same size as the compression chord of the trusses, and have either a constant or stepwise parabolic distribution of axial load.

The theoretical model treats an off-axis unidirectional ply as an inhomogeneous material, and considers the effect of rigid body rotations of the fibres within the matrix material. Linear analytical, and nonlinear finite element solutions are developed for the model. The differences between the new model and the traditional homogenous orthotropic characterisation are functions of both the strain level, and the relative modulus ratio (Ef/Em) of the constituent materials. For relative constituent moduli typical of most common FRP materials, there are significant differences between the new Rigid Body Motion (RBM) model and homogenous orthotropic characterisations at strains greater than 1%. In a 30&#176; case with Ef/Em = 100 and a strain level of 2%, the RBM theory predicts a longitudinal modulus 11% higher than the linear orthotropic theory. At small strain levels the RBM theory reduces to the homogenous orthotropic approximation. A simple and reliable methodology is developed and verified for the experimental characterisation of off-axis tensile FRP specimens. The method applies a tensile load to a thin walled tubular specimen through a high strength, small diameter length of steel wire. The low torsional stiffness of the wire allows one end of the tube to rotate, thus preventing any torsional constraint. Analytical and experimental verifications both indicate that the required tensile load can be applied to tubular specimens without significant torsional constraint. The wire based testing method is used to measure the off-axis stiffness properties of carbon/epoxy tubular specimens at a range of fibre orientations.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple shear compaction of basecourse aggregates</field><field name="creator">Peploe, Ross John</field><field name="description">The objective of this research project has been to develop a computer controlled cyclic simple shear apparatus and to investigate the repeated load behaviour of local basecourse aggregates with regard to their shear modulus and volume change properties. A detailed discussion of the construction of the apparatus and the development of the control systems is presented. A review of the litreature regarding cyclic load testing of basecourse aggregates has been undertaken and presented in this thesis. A large number of shear displacement controlled cyclic simple shear tests were carried out using three types of local Auckland aggregate. A comparison of the performance of these materials is presented with particular emphasis placed on the shear modulus, volume change and particle degredation properties. High repitition cyclic simple shear tests have revealed an apparent stiffness recovery for granular specimens between test runs. This behaviour is difficult to explain, however it is thought to be related to the transition from a dynamic to a static state of friction within the specimen. The volume change properties of granular specimens have been found to be equivalent to the 'normally consolidated - over consolidated' behaviour of fine grained soils. This observation is consistent with that reported by Youd (1970) who performed similar tests using specimens of sand. The implications of this result are discussed with respect to the potential application to highway engineering. A number of shear stress controlled cyclic simple shear tests have been performed to investigate the applicability of a stability threshold for basecourse materials. The stability threshold, or shakedown behaviour, has been observed and is incorporated in a philosophy for pavement design. An example of this method has been performed to show the potential merits of including stability threshold data in the pavement design procedure.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The plug flow of paper pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Moller, Klaus</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis is part of a programme of research concerning the flow behaviour of paper pulp suspensions commenced at the University of Auckland in 1969. A primary aim of the research was to supply the industry with reliable pipe friction data for the pulps manufactured in New Zealand mills. Secondly, it was hoped to increase the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of flow of the suspensions in pipes and so devise a more satisfactory method of correlation than the one used at present. Pipe friction data were obtained for two N.Z. groundwood pulps, two N.Z. Kraft pulps and one imported Kraft pulp in 1, 2, 3 and 4 inch pipes for a wide range of consistencies and velocities. The data were of the same form as previously reported in the literature, but for a given set of conditions the friction losses were lower for the N.Z. pulps. For Kraft pulps the curves of head loss versus velocity exhibited the usual maxima and minima, but for groundwoods the decrease in head loss from the maximum to the minimum and the subsequent rise were replaced by an approximately level portion. The data in the regime before the maxima in the head loss curves for Kraft pulps were correlated to allow extrapolation to the larger pipes used in the paper mill. This regime incorporates the majority of practical flow situations for consistencies over two per cent. The limits of the regime were approximately defined by values of the dimensionless friction factor. The correlation method used was a slight modification of that employed by previous authors. The data for groundwood pulps were correlated in a similar way. The head losses predicted by the new correlations were consistently lower than those calculated from previous equations. Observation of the flow in perspex pipes confirmed the mechanisms of flow proposed by some previous authors, but disagreed with the mechanisms proposed by others. The mechanisms of flow of groundwood pulps were found to be essentially similar to those of Kraft pulps except that the groundwoods exhibited a plug cleavage phenomenon at very low velocities. The different shapes of friction curve for the two types of pulp were attributed directly to their macroscopic properties. A flow model was developed on the basis of the observed flow behaviour in pipes in which the suspensions move as a fibre/water plug surrounded by a sheared water annulus. The model assumed that the annulus formed as a result of the action of the hydrodynamic shear stress on the fibre network comprising the plug. The analysis resulted in an expression relating the average velocity and the longitudinal pressure gradient in the pipe and also incorporated the pipe radius, the viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; and a pseudo shear modulus for the fibre network G. The plug flow model was found to apply to the data in the regime before the maximum in the head loss curve. The relation between the pressure gradient and the pipe diameter as predicted by the model was slightly erroneous for some pulps, although it was the same as that in the standard empirical correlation used in design by the industry. This led to the conclusion that the deflection of fibre ends on the plug surface also contributed to the formation of the annulus, as proposed by previous authors. The relative importance of the two mechanisms of annulus formation was used to explain the occurrence of the maxima and minima in the head loss curves for chemical pulps. The plug flow model was found to be closely related to both the direct correlation method used in the past and to the standard pseudoplastic model for non-Newtonian pipe flow. The model was also applied to analogous flow in a rotational viscometer. The values of the pseudo shear modulus G calculated from the rotational viscometry data were the same as those calculated from pipe flow data under certain conditions. However, limitations in the equipment and the effect of gravitational settling restricted the results to a narrow range. The behaviour of the pulp suspensions in batch settling tests varied markedly from pulp to pulp. There was a high correlation between the pseudo shear modulus G obtained from pipe flow data and the final height of the suspension in a settling test. Likewise there was a relationship between the effective viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; (as modified by the proportion of fines in the pulp) and the initial settling rate in a batch test. This suggested that a simple and accurate method of determining pipe friction data from batch settling test data is possible. Settling tests also showed that air content and the presence of acidic and basic ions, but not the viscosity of the suspending medium, increased the strength of fibre networks. A further correlation method to incorporate all flow regimes was suggested from the results of the present investigation and from indications in the literature that fibre networks behave like Bingham plastics when they are sheared.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of soil-pile interaction under static loads</field><field name="creator">Goldsmith, Peter R.</field><field name="description">This model study is concerned with attempting to identify some of the mechanics of pile-soil interaction under the influence of static loads, as a pre-requisite to defining the mechanics of the soil response to pile transmitted dynamic (i.e. seismic) lateral soil loads. The emphasis has been directed at the mechanics of the response of the soil to loads transmitted through the pile, rather than the more usual approach of defining an analytical pile model and assuming a soil response. The work contained herein follows the incremental deformations occurring within a soil mass throughout the process of installation through to the ultimate lateral loading condition. To enable this to be done the comparatively recent developments in soil mechanics involving the application of the techniques of stereophotogrammetry and radiography, have been employed. The study is mainly involved with short rigid models in dry dense sand. A more general aim of the research project has been to attempt to draw the more research orientated and practical aspects of the statically loaded pile problem closer together. To this end, state-of &#8211;the-art reviews of both the axial and lateral loading situations have been conducted and an attempt made to relate them to the mechanics of soil response, as identified both in this research project and from full scale tests reported in the literature. An attempt has been made to apply some of the more general observations resulting from the study, to the Type A prediction, (i.e. before the event), of the ground line displacements of a full scale pile under real site conditions when subjected to various loads.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The flow behaviour of particulate solids and capsules in wood pulp fibre suspensions</field><field name="creator">Walmsley, Michael Richard Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation into the flow behaviour of particulate solids and capsules in wood pulp fibre suspensions. Emphasis is placed on measuring pipe friction loss and stability of solids-fibre slurries and fibre-capsule mixtures in straight horizontal pipes. It is shown that low concentrations (1-3 %v) of wood pulp fibre form a structured carrier fluid with ability to support particles while behaving like a liquid of low viscosity. At moderate flow velocities fibres damp turbulence and friction losses become lower than water. If solids are preferentially injected into the fibre suspension as a central core, or in a capsule as dry solids, pipe friction loss is reduced further, as is pipe wear. At very low fibre concentrations (&lt;1%v), fibres reduce the friction loss of conventional solid-water mixtures and act as a drag reducing additive. The network strength properties of five wood fibre suspensions are reported and their application to slurry flow is discussed. Settling data for particulate solids, coherent dense-phase cores and capsules are presented and various mechanisms of support are described. Two flow techniques for transporting coarse and dense-phase particle suspensions are proposed, along with strategies for injecting solid particulates into a pipeline. Pipe friction loss data are presented for solids-fibre mixtures of wood chips (7-15 mm), coarse (+2-10 mm) and fine (+0.5-1.0 mm) coal, sand (+0.32-2.0 mm), iron ore (+0.05-0.28 mm), and cylindrical capsules (loaded with dry solids) flowing in 54, 79 and 101.6 mm diameter PVC pipes. Some pipe friction loss data are presented for solids transported as a central core supported by an annulus of fibre suspension. The key flow parameters are also optimized and a preliminary cost comparison is made. Coarse coal suspensions (up to 4O %v) with fibre concentrations of 0.7 to 1.0 percent have been shown to exhibit friction losses about 40 percent below that of the equivalent coalwater slurry. Adding 0.8 percent fibre to water is shown to reduce capsule friction head loss up to 50 percent.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outage probability in mobile radio systems</field><field name="creator">Sowerby, K. W. (Kevin W.)</field><field name="description">Outage probability calculations are presented for the analogue land mobile radio situation where in order to obtain satisfactory radio reception both a sufficient CNR and CIR need to be achieved simultaneously. Such calculations can be used in the design and analysis of mobile radio systems and may be particularly useful for investigating the effects of cochannel interference in cellular systems. The outage probability expressions are derived using previously reported statistical descriptions of mobile radio propagation. Attention is generally focussed on situations where signals suffer Rayleigh fading and/or lognormal shadowing. However calculations for Nakagami-m, Rice and Weibull fading are also considered. The rapid growth in cellular mobile radio systems has stimulated the development of outage probability calculations for multiple interferer situations. Previously, while single interferer situations had been treated exactly, multiple interferers had been treated by approximate methods. In this thesis exact multiple interferer outage probability expressions are presented for the Rayleigh fading and the joint 'fading and shadowing' (Suzuki) situations. Similar expressions, but for more limited cases, are also presented for lognormal and Nakagami-m statistics. Using results from these expressions the accuracies of several approximate outage probability methods are assessed. The exact outage probability expressions for multiple Suzuki interferer situations are closely related to those for multiple Rayleigh interferer situations. Indeed, the exact analytic expressions for Rayleigh statistics form an integral part of the corresponding outage probability expressions for Suzuki statistics. These latter expressions can be readily evaluated using Gauss-Hermite numerical integration. In order to demonstrate the use of such calculations for mobile radio system analysis several theoretical examples are presented. Outage probability calculations for multiple interferer systems which employ diversity reception as a means of improving communications reliability are considered. Similarly, the extension of outage probability concepts to digital systems is briefly outlined.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bus crew scheduling and the set partitioning model</field><field name="creator">Falkner, Julie Carolyn</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a bus crew scheduling method, based on a set partitioning model, for the Christchurch Transport Board, New Zealand. It also examines in detail the effects of the high degree of degeneracy in scheduling set partitioning models. Degeneracy can cause severe computational difficulties because it inflates the number of simplex iterations needed to solve the set partitioning linear programme. In this thesis, it is shown that a maximum-pivot leaving variable criterion can considerably improve the performance of the simplex method, but that this alone is insufficient. Experiments with several degeneracy-resolving techniques have been performed on a class of highly degenerate problems arising from an air crew rostering application, and the results are discussed. Before the set partitioning model can be applied to scheduling, the problem size must be heuristically reduced. Therefore the overall Christchurch system is divided into several subsystems which are solved sequentially. Also, a three-stage method has been developed which essentially considers each type of duty individually. At the first stage, meal-breaks are allocated carefully to reduce the effects of the loss of interaction among the subproblems. A further heuristic reduction technique is then applied to each subproblem, not only to reduce its size but also to improve its integer properties. The resulting solution method has been applied to the Christchurch weekday scheduling problem. A special technique for the Sunday scheduling problem has also been developed. The two methods are described and the promising results which have been achieved are discussed.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local scour at bridge piers</field><field name="creator">Chiew, Yee Meng</field><field name="description">Local scour at cylindrical bridge piers in both uniform and non-uniform cohesionless sediments was investigated experimentally. The aim of the study was to improve understanding of local scour around bridge piers with sediment transport. Three empirical functions which relate the equilibrium depth of scour with approach velocity, flow depth and sediment size were obtained for uniform sediments. The effects of armouring and sediment sizes were also investigated for non-uniform sediments. The experimental results for the variation of equilibrium scour depth (normalised with the pier diameter) with approach velocity show that the equilibrium scour depth reaches a maximum at the threshold condition of the bed sediment. Above the threshold velocity, the scour depth first decreases and then increases again with increasing velocity to a maximum at the transition flat bed condition. At still higher velocities, the equilibrium scour depth decreases due to the formation of antidunes. Lesser scour depths are recorded with ripple forming sediment at threshold conditions because the bed associated with a ripple forming sediment is unable to remain planar. In live-bed conditions, the effect of rippling diminishes for increasing velocity and becomes negligible for UO/UOC &gt; 2. The experimental results for the variation of equilibrium scour depth with flow depth show that the trend for live-bed scour of increasing scour depth with increasing YO/D until a maximum influence of YO/D is reached, is similar to that for clear water scour as shown by Ettema (1980). A flow depth adjustment factor, K(YO/D), which is related to YO/D with D/d50 as the third parameter is presented which indicates to a designer the sequence of estimation of the effect of flow depth on the equilibrium depth of scour. The effect of sediment size on the eguilibrium scour depth is presented in terms of the relative size of pier to sediment, D/d50. A family of curves, at various values of UO/UOC, which relate dav/D and D/d50 for live-bed scour was obtained. The curves show that the equilibrium scour depth increases almost linearly for increasing values of D/d50 until it reaches the value of D/d50 = 50 after which the scour depth becomes independent of D/d50. A similar trend was obtained by Ettema (1980) for clear water scour. For design purposes, the data for large values of YO/D are presented in terms of a sediment adjustment factor, K(D/d), which is shown to be independent of the flow velocity. Both flow depth and sediment size functions include results by Shen et al (1966), Ettema (1980), Chee (1982), and the present study. Armouring and sediment size play an important role in reducinq the equilibrium scour depth for non-uniform sediments. The latter is particularly significant in laboratory experiments where the size of the pier is generally small relative to the size of the coarse particles in non-uniform sediments. Experiments were conducted under dynamic equilibrium conditions where there is continuous sediment input from upstream of the scour hole such that at equilibrium, the amount of sediment entering the bridge site is equal to that leaving. Both the effects of armouring and sediment size diminish for increasing velocity. At high velocity where all the sediment particles are mobile, the non-uniform sediment behaves like a uniform sediment. Hence, armouring does not occur and the equivalent size used for sediment adjustment is based on the d50 size of the sediment bed. At low velocity, armouring at the base of the scour hole is prominent and adjustment of D/d is based on the d90 size of the original mixture. An alternative condition can exist in natural rivers in contrast to the dynamic equilibrium conditions simulated in this study. This is where the upstream river is armoured such that there is little or no sediment input to the scour hole. It is postulated that, in this case, the equilibrium scour depth can approach the maximum equilibrium scour depth for clear water conditions (i.e. dav/D + 2.3) when the approach velocity is equal to the critical velocity of the non-uniform sediment. Finally, a design flow chart is presented for estimation of the equilibrium depth of local scour for design purposes. In live-bed scour where bed features are present, the results show that half the height of the bed features can be added to the estimated equilibrium scour depth.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The one dimensional behaviour of sand</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Robert Charles Koch</field><field name="description">This study examines the one dimensional response of sand.

The one dimensional experimental results obtained from this apparatus are modelled using a mechanistic theory proposed by Dr G. R. Martin.

In heterogeneous media the material parameters may vary with position, dependent variable value and/or time. The governing equation of a physical problem in heterogeneous media is therefore likely to involve variable coefficients. For this reason the solution of variable coefficient partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important engineering problem. In this thesis ways of solving linear variable coefficient PDEs using the boundary element method have been investigated. The application of the boundary element method to these equations is hampered by the difficulty of finding a fundamental solution. In the literature several methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. A survey of these methods has been undertaken in this study from which it is concluded that the most promising approach is the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DR-BEM). The DR-BEM is tested in this thesis for a range of elliptic variable coefficient PDEs. The results of these test problems indicate that the DR-BEM is a promising method for solving elliptic variable coefficient PDEs. However, in some cases, such as problems in highly heterogeneous media, it is found that a large number of internal solution nodes are necessary to ensure accurate results. This can make the DR-BEM computationally expensive. Some new approaches for improving the efficiency of the DR-BEM are proposed. For problems in highly heterogeneous media a subregion approach is recommended. The use of the DR-BEM for linear parabolic variable coefficient PDEs is also investigated. It is found that by combining the DR-BEM with the coupled finite difference &#8211; boundary element method a wide range of parabolic problems can be solved without requiring domain integration. This time-stepping approach can become expensive for variable coefficient PDEs (particularly for large-time solutions) as it requires the solution of a large number of associated elliptic problems with large numbers of internal nodes. Also, it is found that for some problems in highly heterogeneous media the error at each time-step can accumulate leading to poor large-time solutions. To avoid these limitations semi-analytic approaches for solving parabolic equations are investigated. A new semi-analytic method - the separation of variables dual reciprocity method (SOV-DRM) - is proposed which constructs the solution as an eigenfunction expansion. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined using the DR-BEM. This method allows parabolic problems to be solved without requiring time-stepping or domain integration. This method is found to produce accurate results for a range of problems including some problems involving heterogeneous media. Two other semi-analytic methods are also investigated. These methods are implemented and compared with the SOV-DRM. It is concluded that each method has specific strengths and weaknesses and that the choice of method is largely problem dependent.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two-phase gas-liquid flow with particular emphasis on holdup measurements and predictions</field><field name="creator">Chen, J.

Two simple devices for holdup measurements were developed in this work and their behaviours were also found to be flow pattern dependent. The results are as follows: In the analytical study, the original Lockhart-Martinelli formulation was treated analytically for ideal stratified flow giving equations which agree with experimental pressure drop and holdup data and the more rigorously derived relationships of Johannessen and Taitel &amp; Dukler. For ideal annular flow, the derived equations predicted pressure drop in large diameter pipes reasonably well giving results which are in agreement with the modified equation of Baker. Poor prediction was achieved for small diameter pipes. The holdup equations derived for annular flow were also in poor agreement with experimental data although a slight modification resulted in an equation that was not only suitable for holdup prediction, but also may be used to represent the original Lockhart-Martinelli holdup correlation over the entire operating range. A correlation was presented for the frictional pressure drop in annular flow based on laboratory air-water data and geothermal steam-water data. The correlation was found to predict pressure loss values which agreed with data from various different sources. The correlation exhibited a point of inflexion which was believed to be due to the transition from a ripple wave type of interfacial disturbance to one of roll wave-droplet entrainment. An extensive literature survey showed that such a transition at high gas rate occurs at all flow orientations and is governed by a critical liquid rate given by a definite value of the Weber number defined in terms of the liquid phase. The Butterworth form of holdup equation was justified by assuming ideal stratified and annular turbulent-turbulent and viscous-viscous flows. A full set of equations for stratified flow covering the cases of liquid-gas, turbulent-viscous and viscous-turbulent were also derived. It was found that the variation in the coefficients and exponential factors in the Butterworth equation was due to at least three factors: the flow pattern, the flow regimes of the phases, i.e., viscous or turbulent, and the range of the value of the ratio of the liquid holdup to the voidage. Furthermore, experimental data were found to behave according to whether the flow pattern was stratified, slug and plug or annular. Equations for determining these flow patterns were presented, based on the derived stratified flow equations, and were checked to be in agreement with the flow pattern maps of Mandhane et al and Taitel &amp; Dukler, and the experimental flow pattern observations of this work. Since the derivation from the original Lockhart-Martinelli formulation did not yield a completely satisfactory relationship for the holdup and pressure drop in annular flow, such a relationship was examined in terms of the film flow equations, Newton's law of viscosity and the Prandtl&#8217;s mixing length. This was also compared with the analysis of Levy of annular-mist flow using the mixing length theory. Throughout the analysis, the results were compared with various sources of laboratory air-water data and geothermal steam-water data, and the discrepancies, if any, were discussed. The rise velocity of Taylor bubbles in conduits was also examined in terms of the film flow equations, the Newton's law of viscosity, the Prandtl&#8217;s mixing length theory and the universal velocity distribution equations. The rise velocity of a Taylor bubble as derived by the Prandtl's mixing length theory has the same form as that derived by Dumitriscu and Davies &amp; Taylor who used the classical potential flow theory. The analysis was extended to justify the Armand equation for holdup for slug and plug flows. Thus, to summarise the analytical work presented in this work, given a set of input conditions, the flow pattern may be predicted as one of three: stratified, slug and plug, annular. From a knowledge of the flow pattern, appropriate methods of holdup and pressure drop prediction may be chosen. The interrelationships between holdup and pressure drop for stratified and annular flow have also been shown. In the experimental study, the application of two simple devices, developed in this work, one of which was subsequently patented, for holdup measurement was investigated. Both devices were found to be flow pattern dependent in their behaviour and require calibrations. During the study of these two devices, pressure drop, holdup and flow pattern data were also generated and were used for the comparison with the analytical part of this work.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation of geothermal reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Krol, Dexter E.</field><field name="description">This work presents a numerical model for simulating the response of a geothermal reservoir to exploitation. The techniques developed are more efficient and in many ways superior to those of previous investigators. The model is capable of yielding a description of transient mass and heat flow in either a one- or two-dimensional reservoir defined by Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates. The techniques enable simulation of a geothermal flow in all three thermodynamic states &#8211; compressed water, two-phase and superheated steam regions &#8211; and transitions between these states. The model is able to simulate a geothermal system where the presence of carbon dioxide as a second component influences exploitation response. Results are presented for a range of reservoir states. The effects of different physical parameters are considered. The usefulness of the model for looking at real systems is demonstrated by simulating the development of Wairakei and Broadlands geothermal areas in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-cost power generating technology for small-scale stand-alone applications.</field><field name="creator">Elder, Julian M.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical basis and the practical implications for using small-scale (up to 50 kW) low-cost power generating systems comprising an ungoverned turbine, a three phase self-excited induction generator, a variable VAr source for voltage regulation, and an electronic load governor. The thrust of this work is towards the reduction of cost by replacing the more conventional synchronous generator by an induction machine and, by eliminating the site-specific fully-governed turbine. An electronic load governor, utilising zero-voltage switching to minimise waveform distortion, is used to regulate the system frequency by controlling the generator loading. The performance of the load governor is analysed in conjunction with both synchronous and induction generators, and the conditions under which the governed system is stable are determined. The induction machine is shown to have better operating characteristics than the synchronous machine and has the further advantages of low maintenance and ready availability making it particularly suitable for isolated applications. A theoretical explanation of the process by which an induction machine self-excites when capacitance is connected across its terminals is developed, and methods of guaranteeing excitation are proposed. It is shown that the remanent magnetism, present in the rotor, plays a significant role in the machine excitation and the conditions leading to loss of remanence are investigated. Once excited, the operation of the induction generator is analysed for both balanced and unbalanced loadings. The practical implications of these results are taken into account in proposals for single phase supplies, these being more desirable in smaller systems. A range of static VAr sources, including a switched capacitor VAr source and an inductively loaded ac-to-dc converter, are considered for controlling the machine&#8217;s excitation. The VAr sources are compared on the basis of harmonic distortion and system stability. The thesis considers the application of these devices to micro-hydro and wind generating systems. Preliminary investigations have been carried out into the use of two-speed induction machines to improve the efficiency of CSCF Constant Speed Constant Frequency wind generating schemes and into the use of centrifugal pumps as ungoverned turbines. Practical results obtained from laboratory experiments and tests on existing micro-hydro installations are included. It is shown that significant reductions in cost are obtainable by employing the methods discussed in this thesis. The resultant systems may incur a reduction in efficiency but there is little reduction in performance and in many respects the quality of supply is improved.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A separate texture/edge image coding system.</field><field name="creator">Knowles, David John</field><field name="description">Digitised pictures have both cosmetic and scientific image aspects. This thesis presents an image coding system that compresses monochromatic digital image information in such a way that the cosmetic-or viewed-image aspects of a reconstructed picture are indistinguishable from the original to a (human) observer. The coding system is concerned with viewed aspects of digitised images and is based on a simplified 2-channel model of the human eye, with the image information being separated into slowly varying texture information and rapidly changing edge information corresponding to those two channels. Each of the two types of image data is coded using techniques suited to its individual characteristics. Texture information is coded using predictive waveform coding where the predictive filter coefficients are generated by linear predictive coding (LPC) techniques. Since the waveform prediction is not perfect, this thesis evaluates several different methods of differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) coding the residual prediction error. This signal is then used to improve the texture coding quality. Image edges are isolated from the digital image data by an asymptotically optimal edge detector known as the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filter. Using two image edge models, the LOG isolated edges produce contours which are used to define edge position, shape, and "sharpness". The edge position data is then compressed using a chain-coding system. The thesis also considers the effect the edge characteristics have on the coding system and develops two methods for reducing the number of coded edges. Reconstruction of the coded image is in two parts corresponding to the two channels of the coding system. The texture information is reconstructed by predicting texture pixels and adding the decoded DPCM error signal. Edge information not contained in the texture coding channel is reconstructed using only edge information corresponding to the high spatial frequency channels of the human eye. These two channels are added together producing the final coded image reconstruction. Also considered are the effects of varying the original image sampling density. The 2-channel coding system is applicable to a wide variety of images, producing coded images with a high visual quality and coding bitrates as low as 0.6 bits/pixel (256 x 256 pixel images), while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead both at the encoder and the decoder.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of management controls in product development</field><field name="creator">Akroyd, Christopher Lorin</field><field name="description">Product development is critical for many firms, because in many industries the development of products has become a primary source of competitive advantage. To manage this process many firms use management controls, but the effect of those controls on product development is not clear. Recent research in the product development field suggests that the role of management control is to reduce uncertainty rather than the traditionally-assumed focus of promoting goal congruence, and that organisation members use management controls in an interactive style rather than in the traditionally-assumed diagnostic style. The objective of this thesis is to provide empirical insight into management control practices in product development with particular reference to the interface between organisation members across different functions and hierarchal levels within the organisation. It examines both the role of management controls; either to promote goal congruence or to reduce uncertainty, and the style in which management controls are used; either interactively, diagnostically, to set boundaries, or influence beliefs during the activities that take place during the product development process for different types of product development project. To better understand how this takes place this thesis reports on the boundary objects (i.e. numbers, documents and models) that organisation members use during the product development activities to accomplish management control in practice. Empirical field material was collected during a nine-month intensive longitudinal field study, informed by practice theory (ethnomethodology), which was carried out at a large Australasian multinational company within the consumer foods industry. A participant observation approach was used to collect material from a wide range of sources within the company, including interactions and meetings involving executive managers, functional managers, and product development project teams who were members of the technology, marketing, sales, operations and finance departments. The empirical results indicate that the role of management control changes during the product development process alternating between reducing uncertainty and promoting goal congruence. The style in which management controls are used also differs depending on the stage of the product development process and the nature of the product development projects. Finally, management control was accomplished through the use of different boundary objects for each type of product development project.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management Control</field><field name="subject">Product Development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb Adsorption by Iron Oxyhydroxides in SO4-rich Systems Simulating Acid Mine Drainage</field><field name="creator">Swedlund, Peter James</field><field name="description">Acid mine drainage (AMD) typically involves waters with low pH (pH 2-4) and high concentrations of Fe, SO4 and potentially toxic trace metals. Adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxides is the dominant mechanism controlling the transport and toxicity of trace metals in water bodies impacted by AMD. The purpose of this study was to apply the Diffuse Layer Model (DLM) to describe the adsorption of trace metals by iron oxyhydroxides from these systems, using synthetic iron oxyhydroxide minerals, ferrihydrite, pure acicular goethite, SO4-rich goethite prepared from FeSO4 oxidation and a synthetic schwertmannite.  The ferrihydrite adsorption of the trace metals Cu, Zn, Cd and Co from single sorbate systems was accurately described using the DLM with two surface site types (type-1 and type-2) having site densities of 0.005 and 0.2 mol (mol Fe)-1 respectively. The ferrihydrite adsorption of SO4 from single sorbate systems was accurately described using the DLM with adsorption on the type-2 sites. However, the enhanced adsorption of Cu, Zn, Cd and Co in the presence of SO4 was not predicted using adsorption constants derived from single sorbate systems. By including a neutral ternary complex with stoichiometry &#61626;Fe(2)OHMeSO4 (where &#61626;Fe(2)OH is a type-2 surface site and Me is the trace metal) the effect of SO4 on metal adsorption was accurately described for the range of Me, Fe and SO4 concentrations studied. The adsorption of Cu and Zn onto schwertmannite at total metal to iron ratios (MeT:Fe) up to 8 x 10-3 was almost identical to that predicted for ferrihydrite in the presence of 0.01 mol kg-1 SO4. To model the ferrihydrite adsorption of Pb from single sorbate systems a third higher affinity site (type-0) with a site density of 0.00035 mol (mol Fe)-1 was required. The effect of SO4 on Pb adsorption could only be modelled by including a neutral ternary complex on both the type 1 and type 2 sites in the case of Pb. Metal adsorption onto a pure acicular goethite could be accurately described by the DLM with two surface site types. The type 2 site density that provided the best fit to the goethite adsorption data was 0.027 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 2.3 nm-2. The type-1 site density that provided the best fit to goethite adsorption of Cu, Pb and Cd was 0.00028 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 0.024 nm-2. For Zn adsorption on goethite the type-1 site density was significantly larger at 0.0015 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 0.13 nm-2. In all cases studied the presence of SO4 caused an increase in the extent of metal adsorption by goethite. This increased adsorption of metals in the presence of SO4 was accurately predicted by including ternary complex formation at both the high and low affinity adsorption sites. For both ferrihydrite and goethite the values of adsorption constants for ternary complex formation (logKxMeTC) were related to the adsorption constant for metal adsorption in the absence of SO4 (logKxMeINT). This was evident from a plot of logKxMeTC as a function of logKxMeINT for all metals, which showed a linear relationship with slope of 0.69 and intercept of 8.03. This relationship suggests that the enhancement of metal adsorption on both oxyhydroxides due to SO4 occurs by the same process.  When comparing Cu, Zn and Cd adsorption onto ferrihydrite and acicular goethite the effect of the larger goethite adsorption constants are approximately compensated for by the lower goethite site densities. Therefore the Cu, Cd and Zn adsorption isotherms on ferrihydrite and acicular goethite are fairly similar at low adsorption densities. In the case of Pb, the site densities and adsorption constants are both larger on ferrihydrite and there is a large difference between the ferrihydrite and acicular goethite adsorption isotherms.  Sulfate-rich goethite had considerably higher site densities, per mol of oxide, than the pure acicular goethite. Adsorption onto the sulfate-rich goethite could be modelled reasonably accurately using the parameters developed to model adsorption onto the pure acicular goethite but with a higher surface area and a higher ratio of type-1 to type 2 sites. In general, therefore, the parameters developed for pure goethite are apparently similar to those for the sulfate-rich goethite, but are not directly transferable. The difficulty in measuring the surface area of the highly aggregated sulfate-rich goethite makes comparisons between the two goethites more difficult.  The adsorption of Cu, Zn and Cd onto the SO4-rich goethite exceeds that of ferrihydrite because the higher adsorption constants of goethite are combined with the considerably higher site densities of the SO4-rich goethite compared to the acicular goethite. In contrast the higher site densities of the SO4-rich goethite does not completely compensate for the low logKINT values of Pb adsorption on goethite. Therefore SO4-rich goethite adsorption of Pb is lower than that of ferrihydrite.  When applied to literature data from AMD oxides the parameters derived in this thesis have significantly improved the ability of the DLM to predict trace metal adsorption in AMD systems, compared to using ferrihydrite as a proxy for all iron oxyhydroxides and adsorption data derived only from single sorbate systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">ferrihydrite</field><field name="subject">goethite</field><field name="subject">sulfate</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">AMD</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brave New Zealand: the construction of a New Zealand identity</field><field name="creator">Skilling, Peter D.</field><field name="description">In 1999, Helen Clark&#8217;s New Zealand Labour Party came to power at the head of a coalition government. Central to the new government&#8217;s agenda was the strengthening of national identity. In the face of increasing globalisation and individualism, the Government saw national identity as something that should be both internally protected (as the guarantor of social cohesion) and externally projected (as a source of value in global markets). The two orientations were related in crucial ways, as New Zealand identity was increasingly narrated around the attitudes and behaviours - such as creativity, innovation and entrepreneurialism - deemed necessary for global economic competitiveness. Drawing on elements of both liberal and critical political theory, and paying particular attention to the discourses deployed by political actors, I describe and critically analyse Labour&#8217;s nation-building project, situating it within a broader project of economic transformation, which was itself a response to a reading of globalisation. Through a detailed examination of the Government&#8217;s political practice in its main statements of intent and in three key policy areas &#8211; cultural, food production and immigration policy - between 1999 and 2007, I ask two questions. Firstly, what constraints were imposed on the assertion of a unique national identity by the Government&#8217;s simultaneous embrace of global economic liberalism? And, secondly, what have been the implications of this assertion for the rights and liberties of individuals and groups within and beyond the state?  Implicit in the nation-building project was an attempt to manage internal difference for the sake of &#8220;the nation&#8221;. Internal diversity could be accepted &#8211; even celebrated &#8211; in the Government&#8217;s project, but only insofar as it was willing and able to contribute to an officially sanctioned vision of a shared national purpose. On this corporate conception of the state, individuals were no longer seen as subjects related by the common recognition of rules of conduct, but as role-performers related in the pursuit of a putative common purpose. The emphasis placed on the trope of the nation asserted a commonality of vision and interests that elided questions of the distribution of costs and benefits, and that marginalised dissenting ideas and perspectives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not just &#8216;old men in raincoats&#8217;: effectiveness of specialised community treatment programmes for sexually abusive children and youth in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Clare-Ann Gabrielle</field><field name="description">This study addresses the hitherto limited research on sexually abusive children and youths in New Zealand (NZ). It encompasses children (12 years or younger) and youths (13 to 19 years) referred to the three largest specialised community sexual offender treatment programmes in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch over a 9&#189; year period. Additionally, three special populations are considered: female sexually abusive youth, youth with &#8216;special needs&#8217; and children (12 years and under).  To increase our understanding of the individual, offending and family characteristics of these children and youths in specialised community treatment programmes in New Zealand Study One audited client&#8217;s clinical files (N = 702). Consistent with international research, New Zealand children and youth who engaged in sexually abusive behaviours not only presented with sexually abusive behaviour(s) but also had other psychological and behavioural issues. These included a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse (38%, n = 263 and 39%, n = 272 respectively), behavioural (63%, n = 442) and mental health problems (65%, n = 457), drug and alcohol misuse (22%, n = 156) and a history of suicide ideation or deliberate self-harm (27%, n = 187). They often had poor social skills (46%, n = 326) and had struggled to establish appropriate peer relationships (44%, n = 306).  Many of the children and youth came from multi-problem and chaotic family backgrounds (e.g., 55%, n = 387 of parents were divorced or separated, 38%, n = 267 were exposed to domestic violence and 32%, n = 222 had family member(s) with a substance abuse problem) and had experienced numerous out-of-home placements (57%, n = 389). Factors associated with resiliency were also investigated. It was found that children and youth primarily victimised male and female children (12 years or younger) (70%, n = 1407), who were acquaintances (57%, n = 1295) or relatives (32%, n = 730). Very few victimised strangers (7%, n = 86 of victims were strangers). They engaged in both &#8216;hands on&#8217; (e.g., penetrative acts) and &#8216;hands off&#8217; offences (e.g., voyeurism). Study Two was a naturalistic treatment outcome study to explore treatment outcomes and involved 682 sexually abusive children and youth who attended three specialised community treatment programmes in New Zealand. The main outcome of interest was sexual recidivism (prevalence rate of re-offending during the follow-up period) with secondary outcome variables of general and violent recidivism. The follow-up period ranged from 1 year to 10 years (mean 4.5 years, SD = 2.2). Three groups were compared: the &#8216;Comparison&#8217; group (referral or assessment only, n = 300), &#8216;Treatment Dropout&#8217; group (those who prematurely terminated their involvement in treatment, n = 165) and the &#8216;Treatment Completer&#8217; group (those successfully completing treatment, n = 217). To allow for triangulation of offences that were dealt with through the youth and adult justice system&#8217;s recidivism data were collected from multiple sources (Child, Youth and Family , Youth Court, and Police criminal charges and convictions data). Post-treatment sexual, general (nonsexual and non-violent) and violent recidivism are reported from each data source as well as overall sexual, general and violent recidivism. Sexual, general and violent re-offending that occurred while the children and youths were attending treatment are also presented. Changes in behavioural problems and the psychological functioning of sexually abusive children and youth between assessment and the end of treatment (as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self Report and Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory) contribute additional outcome measures. This naturalistic outcome study found that the treatment programmes were effective in reducing sexual recidivism amongst sexually abusive children and youth who completed treatment compared with those who did not complete treatment. Less than 3% (2.8%, n = 8) of Treatment Completers sexually re-offended compared with 6% (n = 17) of the Comparison group and 10% (n = 16) of the Treatment Dropout group. Treatment Dropouts were found to be at highest risk of sexual, general and violent recidivism. Recidivism for the three special populations (children, females and &#8216;special needs&#8217; youth) are also presented. The results from the psychological measures indicate a general pattern of reduction in behavioural and psychological problems between assessment and end of treatment. Logistic regression analysis was used in Study Three (N = 682) to explore factors associated with the risk of sexual and nonsexual (violent and general offending) re-offending post-treatment and dropping out of treatment. The factor predictive of sexual recidivism risk was having three or more victims and was associated with a decreased risk of sexual recidivism. Older age at first known sexual offence was associated with increased chance of nonsexual recidivism. Dropping out of treatment and having a history of nonsexual offending were associated with a decreased risk of nonsexual recidivism. Older age at referral and having no external mandate to attend treatment were associated with increased risk of youth dropping out of treatment. A history of mental health problems was associated with a decreased risk of treatment dropout. Conclusions This is the first study of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of sexually abusive children and youth in New Zealand. Its strengths include the large sample size, length of the follow-up period, use of a comparison group and data triangulation to determine recidivism. This study, therefore, compares favourably with international studies. This research enhances understanding of the individual, family and offending characteristics of sexually abusive youth in New Zealand as well as children, females and special needs youth. The Cognitive Behavioural Theory (CBT) based approach of the community programmes in New Zealand was found to be effective in reducing recidivism amongst children and youths who completed treatment. Specific recommendations relevant to treatment programmes and statutory agencies around programme development, referral processes and identification of sexually abusive children and youth are made. Directions for future research are also discussed. These include research exploring outcomes, other than recidivism, for those attending the Maori programmes, possible exploration of typologies within New Zealand sexually abusive children and youth, and subsequent follow-up research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth offending</field><field name="subject">Recidivism</field><field name="subject">Sexual offending</field><field name="subject">Sexually abusive behaviour</field><field name="subject">Children and Youth</field><field name="subject">Outcome study</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic pricing of wireless network resources in a competitive provider setting</field><field name="creator">Roggendorf, Matthias</field><field name="description">The ongoing convergence of cell-based wireless systems, from proprietary standards for data transmission toward a unifying approach based on the Internet Protocol (IP), as well as the increasing ability of wireless computer networks to support Quality-of-Service, opens up a tremendous potential for new business models and is expected to significantly alter the way mobile and wireless services are provided. An important field of study is about understanding the implications on the competitive structure of the wireless market. With the technical barriers between di erent technologies more and more diminishing, it becomes possible for customers to select network access on-demand instead of entering long-term contracts with a single wireless network provider based on factors such as connection speed, level of mobility and prices. In such a setting, wireless network providers, but also the regulatory bodies designing the principle market rules, need to learn about new ways of allocating resources among customers to reach their objectives. With resources being available on-demand, pricing becomes an important factor for controlling demand and distributing resources among users. Instead of being fixed over longer periods, pricing can be used for signalling the congestion levels in di erent wireless networks and to let users communicate their willingness-to-pay to the market. Besides presenting a classification framework for pricing in wireless networks and providing a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, the main contributions of this thesis are on the development of behavioural strategies, which di erent entities can follow in the described scenarios. In the first scenario we regard wireless resources as a public good, which should be efficiently allocated among active customers. By letting each provider use a second price auction, with each customer being able to bundle resources from multiple providers, we develop a bidding strategy, which allows customers to distribute their demand among providers. The bidding strategy resembles truth-telling in such a market and is shown to be the best strategy a user can follow to fulfill his demand. We examine the properties of the system analytically and present the results of an extensive simulation study. In the second scenario we model a free market for wireless resources on which prices are determined at the time of request. With customers having more than one option to obtain resources, the task of a provider becomes setting prices so that it maximises revenue under partial or full competition. We discuss the constrained maximisation problem and analyse the situation of a two-provider setting as a game. Simulation is used to analyse the game under uncertainty and to understand if a steady-state situation arises. While the results make use of multiple simplifications to allow us to understand the main model variables, the findings can potentially be of interest for providers and market authorities to develop new ways for resource allocation using dynamic pricing as a tool for reaching their design objectives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Pricing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary-school children's conceptions of light and their relation to the historical progression of optics</field><field name="creator">Noble, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The current study assessed children&#8217;s ideas on light and optics using a cross-sectional design.  Given current literature and theory within cognitive psychology, history of science and science education, it was expected that (i) older children would be more likely than younger children to have a modern scientific understanding of light concepts; (ii) for many of the light concepts, there would be a parallel between the pattern of progression and change in children&#8217;s conceptions of light and scientists&#8217; conceptions of light throughout history, and, finally; (iii) employing a historical lens would allow for a better understanding of not only the age-related patterns in children&#8217;s ideas of light but also children&#8217;s age specific alternative conceptions of light. A Light Core Concepts Questionnaire (LCCQ) was administered to participants (N=757) from across a wide age group (6 to 12 years).  The participants were representative of ethnic groups attending a range of primary schools situated in a large New Zealand city.  None of the participants had received classroom instruction in light and optics.  The verbally delivered LCCQ was used to elicit children&#8217;s responses about prerequisite concepts necessary for a scientific understanding of the physics of light and employed two-choice, multi-choice and open-ended questions.  Some questions were specifically designed to compare children&#8217;s conceptual understanding on light and optics with ideas adopted throughout the history of science. The results of the current research found that with increasing age (6 to 12 years old) children&#8217;s modern scientific understanding for many concepts on the physics of light increases.  In comparison with other research, a higher proportion of children participating in the current study held correct views at younger ages.  On easily observable phenomena, children as young as 7 years could identify common light sources and knew that some objects are reflectors of light.  By age 12, the majority of children could correctly identify more abstract concepts such as what causes colours in rainbows. Results of the present research indicate there is a parallel between the age-related patterns of children&#8217;s ideas on light and the historical progression of scientific knowledge of the physics of light.  With regard to light and vision, both early scientists and children held a similar range of alternative beliefs, that is, extramission, intromission or Eastern Islamic theories.  Similar beliefs were shared about other concepts that were accepted as true theories in the history of science.  For example, colour is the property of the object and when an object is placed in water it becomes distorted because water is less perfect than air. The results indicate that the pattern of alternative conceptions held by children as they relate to history provides further understanding of why there are differences in children&#8217;s beliefs about light and optics across age groups.  For more difficult concepts, children and early scientists initially formulate similar theories based on their observations and what appears to be commonsense.  As they reconceptualise their ideas, children and scientists formulate similar more abstract theories.  In addition to discussing the value of the history of science as a lens to better understand children&#8217;s conceptions, the implications of these results are discussed as they relate to specific kinds of interventions or instructional approaches to elicit successful conceptual change in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative morphological, anatomical and embryological studies of Prumnopitys taxifolia and P. ferruginea (Podocarpaceae), and the hydrodynamics of their saccate pollen grains</field><field name="creator">Salter, Joshua</field><field name="description">Prumnopitys taxifolia (Banks et Sol. ex D. Don) de Laub. (matai) and P. ferruginea (D. Don) de Laub. (miro) are two New Zealand podocarps with morphologically very different reproductive structures. In P. taxifolia the pollen cones are sessile on spicate fertile branches, whereas in P. ferruginea they are solitary on short scaly peduncles. Likewise, in P. taxifolia the ovulate strobilus is an attenuated spicate structure bearing globose seeds, whereas in P. ferruginea the reduced ovulate strobilus bears a dorsi-ventrally flattened, usually solitary seed on a slender scaly peduncle. Such differences throw doubt on the validity of the current delimitations of the genus Prumnopitys. A comparative embryological study of these two species was done in parallel with a morphological and anatomical study of the reproductive structures to fill gaps in their known reproductive life cycles, and to determine whether there are any differences in the male and female cones or in their embryogeny that are of taxonomic significance at the generic level. In addition the hydrodynamic properties of their saccate pollen grains were compared with that of the pollen of several other conifers and the spores of three ferns and one lycopod. Morphology and Embryology Embryologically these two species are shown to be more similar to each other and to the Chilean Prumnopitys andina than to other podocarp genera. For instance, in both species: the long tapered archegonia have prominent neck cells with a thickened cap overlying them; five free nuclear mitoses occur before cell formation in the proembryo; meiosis can result in both linear and non-linear tetrads of megaspores; the microgametophyte typically forms 7 or 8 prothallial cells before dispersal. However, new morphological and anatomical differences have emerged from this study. In the pollen cones of P. taxifolia, the microsporangia are free with a transverse stomium located close to the cone axis; in P. ferruginea they are fused with the transverse stomium located basally. In P. taxifolia ovules, a tanniniferous layer develops in the epimatium and not in the integument, and fusion of epimatium/integument/nucellus is greatest dorsi-ventrally; in P. ferruginea ovules a prominent tanniniferous layer develops only in the integument, and fusion of epimatium/integument/nucellus is greatest laterally. Furthermore, observations of insect predation point to biochemical differences between P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea. An undescribed species of gall midge appears to be specialized exclusively for the P. taxifolia life cycle, and several other insect larvae prey on the developing and mature seeds, whereas the ovules/seeds of P. ferruginea appear to have almost no insect predators. Morphologically, anatomically and biochemically, P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea may therefore be sufficiently different to warrant being two separate genera; comparable differences have been used to distinguish other genera in the Podocarpaceae. Since embryogeny is likely to be under less evolutionary pressure than morphology and anatomy, and since P. taxifolia (along with P. andina) is regarded by some as basal in the conifers, with P. ferruginea less so, their embryological similarity does not necessarily indicate close relationship, only that they are closer to each other than to the other podocarps. Although their morphological and anatomical differences may be of taxonomic significance, a better understanding of the other species currently in Prumnopitys is necessary before the relationships within the genus can be clarified. Pollen Hydrodynamics Despite the morphological differences in their ovulate cones, P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea have very similar pollination mechanisms involving an inverted micropyle, a pollination drop and saccate pollen. Saccate grains have sometimes been referred to as 'non-wettable' due to their buoyant properties, while non-saccate pollen grains have been described as 'wettable'. The hydrodynamic properties of saccate pollen grains of seven podocarp species in five genera, Dacrydium Sol. ex G. Forst., Dacrycarpus (Endl.) de Laub., Manoao Molloy, Podocarpus L'H&#233;r. ex pers. and Prumnopitys Phil. have been tested in water, together with saccate and non-saccate pollen of four other conifer genera, Cedrus Trew (Pinaceae), Cephalotaxus Siebold &amp; Zucc. ex Endl. (Cephalotaxaceae), Cupressus L. (Cupressaceae) and Phyllocladus Rich. ex Mirb. (Phyllocladaceae), and spores of three fern species and one lycopod species. All four spore types studied were non-wettable, whereas the bisaccate and trisaccate pollen types, like all the other conifer pollen types, were wettable, enabling the grains to cross the surface tension barrier of water. Once past this barrier, grain behaviour was governed by presence or absence of sacci. Non-saccate and vestigially saccate grains sank, whereas saccate grains behaved like air bubbles, floating up to the highest point. In addition, the grains were observed to float in water with sacci uppermost, consistent with the suggestion that distally-placed sacci serve to orientate the germinal furrow of the pollen grain towards the nucellus of an inverted ovule. Observations of pollen grains in the pollen chambers of naturally pollinated Prumnopitys ovules confirmed this. The combination of buoyancy and wettability in saccate pollen has implications for the efficiency of the typical podocarp pollination mechanism. Since saccate pollen, inverted ovules and pollination drops are also characteristic of the Pinaceae, the similarities in the pollination mechanisms and the pollen grains of P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea have no taxonomic significance at the generic level.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In a different voice: a case study of Marianne and Jane Williams, missionary educators in northern New Zealand, 1823-1835.</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Tanya G.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study that examines the educative activities of two Church Missionary Society (CMS) women, Marianne Coldham Williams and her sister-in-law Jane Nelson Williams, during the period 1823-1835. This study examines the role and status of these two missionary women in the early CMS mission station at Paihia in northern New Zealand. Marianne and Jane Williams were missionary educators whose primary task was to establish schools for local Maori pupils and resident missionary pupils. These first mission schools were established according to a perceived hierarchy of "need." Consequently, the first schools, established in 1823 were for Nga Puhi women and girls followed by a school for the missionary daughters in 1826. A school for Nga Puhi men and boys was not established until 1827 and a school for the missionary sons was delayed until 1828. Through the re-formation of Maori women as Christian women, Maori society was to replicate the "pleasantries" of (Pakeha) "Christian society." The schoolroom, not the pulpit became the central site to instigate changes in Maori society and the CMS initially charged Marianne and Jane Williams with the responsibility for this task. One of the strategies developed by Marianne and Jane Williams to survive in a frontier society was to form a network based on their sister-hood. Through the exchanging of letters between the two women in New Zealand and their "sisters" in England, a reciprocal friendship was created that provided Marianne and Jane with the support they sought. These letters and diaries provide valuable autobiographical accounts of the daily lives and missionary activities of Marianne and Jane. This study, therefore, presents a challenge to prevailing historical narratives that position men at the centre of missionary activities. Missionary policy documents and manuscript material written by early nineteenth century missionary women and men reveal that in New Zealand women played a critical role in the "Christianising" and "civilising" policies and practices. In placing women at the centre of historical inquiry and as historical agents, this study re-presents the historical narrative in a different voice.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand defence acquisition decision making: politics and processes</field><field name="creator">Greener, Peter</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of near-surface ozone concentrations in the city of Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Adeeb, Farah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory for schooling improvement: consistency and connectivity to improve instructional practice</field><field name="creator">Annan, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the problem of how to speed up the process through which professional educators learn how to significantly improve disadvantaged students&#8217; academic achievement. The problem is addressed through three questions: (i) What are the most effective national and international examples of school improvement? (ii) What is the condition of the evidence base for making claims of effectiveness? (iii) What can be learned about developing and implementing effective school improvement from those national and international examples? The thesis begins by searching international and national school improvement literature to find those initiatives with the strongest evidence of effectiveness. One initiative in England (the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies) and four initiatives in the United States (Success For All, Direct Instruction, The School Development Programme &amp; a district-wide reform in New York District #2) were considered to have strong evidence of effectiveness. Two initiatives in New Zealand (the Numeracy Development Project &amp; the Strengthening Education in Mangere and Otara project commonly called SEMO) had evidence that showed promise. It is argued that patterns of investment in different types of evaluation and ease of access to achievement information account for the difference between the strong international evidence and promising evidence in New Zealand. A series of investigations in the middle of the thesis focus on the processes set up in the initiatives to help practitioners learn effective reform practices. Three models of learning processes are developed which reveal a strong preference for vertical learning in England and the United States and a more balanced vertical-horizontal learning preference in New Zealand. Despite those contrasts, three characteristics were found to be common to all seven effective initiatives. They are a sharp focus on instructional improvement, a set of standardised practices, and, learning connections to transfer the reform ideas into practice. The latter part of the thesis transforms those three characteristics into a theory for schooling improvement which contribute to a faster and more effective reform process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TV love: television and technologies of intimacy</field><field name="creator">Crozier, Susan</field><field name="description">TV Love is a study of the emotional and imaginative possibilities summoned and sustained by television programmes, possibilities that are here gathered under the rubric of love. By taking seriously a vernacular claim to love particular television programmes, this thesis intervenes in conventional practices of academic television criticism. It does so in order to develop an approach that would allow a focus on what television programmes make possible for the viewers who love them. I argue that the transactions between viewers and television texts constitute forms of emotional training that not only reproduce social subjectification, but also enable diverse forms of intimate experience. This is especially important for those subjects who struggle to find forms of psychic sustenance in an off-screen context. The critical approach taken in this thesis is termed reparative, following the work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, in so far as it describes a process of restoring value to much maligned cultural objects. As a rationale for critical practice, reparation recognises the inadequacy of the social context in which diverse subjects must make a possible world for themselves. In particular, reparation describes the processes by which queer subjects have been able to mark out the terms of their own possibility in the face of difficult social or psychic conditions. The value of reparative criticism is not limited to queer readers or viewers, although queerness frequently demonstrates what is at issue between the conventions of academic television criticism and the alternate mode developed in this thesis. While academic criticism most often focuses on the ideological lessons presumed to be delivered by television programmes, this frequently overlooks the smaller scale emotional work that subjects carry out every day. Television programmes can both enable this emotional work and be the subject of its labours. In order to develop a fuller and more useful practice of television criticism than currently exists, TV Love contends that it is necessary to attend to the affectively enlivening potential of television for its viewers. The first chapter considers television as a technology of intimacy in terms of its domestic location and critically analyses television scholarship that has sought to address the specificity of that context. The second chapter further develops this theoretical overview by examining approaches that more explicitly deal with the affective engagements television allows. It then moves on to outline the particular reparative approach taken in this thesis. Chapter Three considers the series of documentaries that began with Seven Up in 1964 and, in a departure from the conventional discussion of class associated with the documentaries, this chapter focuses on the affective training the series carries out over its four decade history. The situation comedy Bewitched is the focus of the fourth chapter, which explores the way in which sitcoms can be profoundly imbricated in the very experience of childhood and family life. The repetition of a favourite programme from childhood, even years later, can generate emotional returns that demonstrate this intimate connection. Chapter Five continues the discussion of situation comedy with an analysis of the seventies hit The Mary Tyler Moore Show. In particular this chapter attends to the reiterations of the Mary Richards character across other textual contexts in order to identify the emotional competencies the Mary character makes possible beyond her seventies context. Chapter Six takes on the heritage criticism that has framed academic thinking about the serial drama Brideshead Revisited and presents an alternate reading in which high-cultural forms serve to connote homosexuality. The final chapter examines a series of programmes about the late Diana, Princess of Wales in order to identify the affective politics those programmes might be seen to enable.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foraminifera from the Mahoenui Group North Wanganui basin</field><field name="creator">Topping, Robert Mark</field><field name="description">The Mahoenui Group is a body of Oligocene and early Miocene marine clastic sedimentary rock in which two formations are recognized. The first, the Taumatamaire Formation (Happy, 1971) consists of up to 1000m of blue grey calcareous mudstone together with two minor limestones, the Awakino Limestone Member (Hay, 1967) and the Black Creek Limestone Member (new name). The second Formation, the Taumarunui Formation (Nelson &amp; Hume, 1977) is made up of 1000m of flysch. Two facies types are seen in the flysch, the proximal and distal flysch facies. 350 species of Foraminifera are recorded in 167 samples from 47 sections. Their systematics are discussed and many are illustrated using scanning electron photomicrographs. 11 new species are recognised in the genera, Almaena, Anomalina, Epistominella, Gavelinopsis, Globocassidulina, Guttulina, Lamarckina, Lenticulina, Melonis and Verneuilina. One new subspecies of Bolivina reticulata is also recognised. These are not formally named here but will be described in papers to be published later. An appraisal of numerical techniques in taxonomy is made while considering the Globigerina woodi "group" from the Mahoenui. This supports the validity of 5 species of planktonic Foraminifera from New Zealand and illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of numerical classification. The paleoecology and paleobathymetry of the samples is investigated using both conventional and numerical methods. These two approaches are compared, contrasted and then integrated to form a paleogeographic reconstruction.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalizing the entrepreneurial high technology, knowledge-intensive firm</field><field name="creator">Coviello, Nicole Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapapa and the state: some case studies in the impact of central government on traditionally organised M&#257;ori groups</field><field name="creator">Carter, Lynette Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines modern iwi governance systems and their effect on whakapapa as an organisational framework in M&#257;ori societies. The main question addressed was; can whakapapa survive as an organisational process, or will it be stifled, as M&#257;ori societies struggle to establish a strong identity in contemporary New Zealand. As an organisational framework for M&#257;ori societies, whakapapa works through a series of principles that function through relationships between people, and between people and other elements that make up the world. Contemporary M&#257;ori groups continue to claim that they are whakapapa-based societies. This thesis examines that claim by investigating to what extent of "being M&#257;ori" today is about adherence to those principles and to whakapapa-based processes and relationships, and how much is it about being shaped by non-M&#257;ori constructs that have been formed by state-intervention and legislated changes to M&#257;ori social organisation. If being Maori today has as much or more to do with the latter, what place does whakapapa have in contemporary M&#257;ori society, and to what level and to what extent can the principles of whakapapa be upheld as the basis for contemporary M&#257;ori societies. A series of stories and case studies were used to answer the questions posed in the thesis. The case studies demonstrated the ways in which whakapapa worked in everyday situations, and how the people who take part in whakapapa-based relationships understood them to work. They also demonstrated how state intervention through legislation has challenged the way M&#257;ori groups structure themselves when new circumstances have required compromise and change. The institutionalised evolution of M&#257;ori societies is examined in more detail using one example of a modern tribal structure, Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu. The Ng&#257;i Tahu example typifies the implications for M&#257;ori if they choose to move from a whakapapa-based organisational model of governance to a centralised legalbureaucratic model of governance. The adoption of the new centralised governance structures, such as Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu, will mean that M&#257;ori hap&#363; and iwi societies are in danger of disappearing to be replaced by a generic group,shaped by legislation and integrated into the wider nation-state of New Zealand. Whakapapa can only remain at the core of M&#257;ori societies, if M&#257;ori allow it to, but when M&#257;ori adopt centralised "generic" system of governance, hap&#363; and iwi societies, become censored versions of their former selves.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model-based strategies for automated segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images</field><field name="creator">Lin, Xiang, 1971-</field><field name="description">Segmentation of the left and right ventricles is vital to clinical magnetic resonance imaging studies of cardiac function. A single cardiac examination results in a large amount of image data. Manual analysis by experts is time consuming and also susceptible to intra- and inter-observer variability. This leads to the urgent requirement for efficient image segmentation algorithms to automatically extract clinically relevant parameters. Present segmentation techniques typically require at least some user interaction or editing, and do not deal well with the right ventricle. This thesis presents mathematical model based methods to automatically localize and segment the left and right ventricular endocardium and epicardium in 3D cardiac magnetic resonance data without any user interaction. An efficient initialization algorithm was developed which used a novel temporal Fourier analysis to determine the size, orientation and position of the heart. Quantitative validation on a large dataset containing 330 patients showed that the initialized contours had only ~ 5 pixels (modified Hausdorff distance) error on average in the middle short-axis slices. A model-based graph cuts algorithm was investigated and achieved good results on the midventricular slices, but was not found to be robust on other slices. Instead, automated segmentation of both the left and right ventricular contours was performed using a new framework, called SMPL (Simple Multi-Property Labelled) atlas based registration. This framework was able to integrate boundary, intensity and anatomical information. A comparison of similarity measures showed the sum of squared difference was most appropriate in this context. The method improved the average contour errors of the middle short-axis slices to ~ 1 pixel. The detected contours were then used to update the 3D model using a new feature-based 3D registration method. These techniques were iteratively applied to both short-axis and long-axis slices, resulting in a 3D segmentation of the patient&#8217;s heart. This automated model-based method showed a good agreement with expert observers, giving average errors of ~ 1&#8211;4 pixels on all slices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">segmentation</field><field name="subject">automatic</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">atlas-based</field><field name="subject">model-based</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revisioning evangelical theology: an exploration, evaluation and extension of the theological method of Stanley J. Grenz</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brian S.</field><field name="description">In spite of the rapid growth of evangelicalism there is a paucity of reflection on its theological method. The transition from modernity to postmodernity, with the accompanying call for a postfoundationalist rather than a foundationalist method, has provided additional challenges to evangelicalism. Canadian theologian Stanley J. Grenz has proposed a model for evangelical theological construction that utilizes scripture, tradition and culture as the sources for theology, and the Trinity, community and eschatology as its focal motifs. He supplements these with the belief that the Spirit guides the church, and that the community of faith will therefore be pneumatologically guided as it communally attempts to discern truth in a changed context. Grenz believes that his theological method moves beyond foundationalism as it appeals to a trio of interacting sources, rather than to the single source of scripture. In exploring and evaluating Grenz' theological method, this thesis tests the research proposition "that Stanley Grenz' theological method effectively revisions evangelical theology." To ascertain the validity of the proposition, it utilizes four evaluative questions which explore the originality, theological coherence, appropriateness and effectiveness of Grenz'method for evangelical theology. The application of his model in his text, Welcoming but Not Affirming, serves as a test case to determine the implications of his method. Concluding that Grenz' model makes only a modest contribution towards revisioning evangelical theological method, the concluding chapters of the research explore ways to supplement Grenz' model to allow a stronger affirmation of the research proposition. Utilizing Wolterstorff's concept of control beliefs, it proposes that Grenz' model would be more effective if he added a control belief to guide his theological construction, and motivates for adopting the control belief the gospel liberates.ln addition, it argues that Grenz' three focal motifs for theology need to be preceded by the gathering motif of the cross, arguing that if seen outside of this gathering motif, the motifs of Trinity, community and eschatology lack adequate substance. Noting the often acrimonious context in which theological revisioning takes place, the research ends with a plea for the empowerment of imagination in theological construction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

This group is established to contain the igneous and proximal sedimentary products of the lower to mid Miocene west Northland volcanic arc and is divided into three subgroups. The northern, Waipoua, Subgroup (new), consists of the Waipoua Basalt and associated volcaniclastic sediments of the Hokianga - Kaihu area. The central, Hukatere, Subgroup (new), contains volcaniclastic and igneous rocks of the Tokatoka &#8211; okahukura Peninsula area, Kaipara. The southern, Manukau, Subgroup, contains igneous rocks and associated volcaniclastic sediments of the Waitakere Hills and adjacent areas. The Waitakere Hills and their northern extension to Helensville (c.500 km2) have been systematically mapped at a scale of 1:25000 and found to consist of a number of tilted or gently folded blocks of Manukau Subgroup having a low, overall, west to north-west tilt. Five formations and thirteen members are established. The oldest sediments are volcanic-rich proximal turbidites (Cornwallis Formation, upper Po, lower Miocene) that overlie and interfinger with the more distal flysch of the Waitemata Group to the east. Cornwallis Formation, and many of the overlying sediments, accumulated at bathyal depths (800 &#8211; 3000 m+) on the western side of the Waitemata basin. The proximal turbidites were deposited by south-east flowing turbidity currents that passed down submarine canyons from the neritic Kaipara shelf in the north and north-west. Lenticular conglomerates (Albany Conglomerate, Helensville Conglomerate) accumulated in these canyons and distributary channels of the upper and mid fan regions. In uppermost Otaian to mid Altonian times (late lower Miocene), an apron of coarse volcaniclastic sediments (Piha Formation) spread eastwards over the Waitakere Hills area from a growing volcanic pile centred west of the present coastline. Piha Formation contains well-stratified rudites, subsidiary lenticular, cross-bedded and massive rudites, large slump deposits and peripheral submarine extrusions of and site flows, pillows and hyaloclastite. This coarse volcaniclastic belt was deposited on the neritic and upper.bathyal slopes of the volcanic pile and grades eastwards towards the centre of the basin into a fine volcaniclastic belt (Nihotupu Formation) containing well-bedded arenites and lutites, cross-bedded arenites, lenticular conglomerates, slump units and small piles of pillowed andesite. These were deposited at mid to lower bathyal depths. Substantial mid Altonian uplift in the Waitakere Hills was probably connected with eastwards advancing volcanism. The northern area around Muriwai remained marine for a time and several submarine canyons were eroded through the uplifted shelf and filled with pyroclastic-rich sediments (Tirikohua Formation). An extensive, predominantly terrestrial sheet of andesite flows and pyroclastics (Lone Kauri Formation) was erupted over the uplifted central Waitakere Hills area. This sheet vras possibly erupted from the two north-north-west trending, fault-controlled lineations of volcanic necks, craters, plugs, dyke swarms and intrusions that outcrop today along either side of the hills. Volcanian, strombolian and rare pelean eruptions from these centres produced mostly andesitic products plus one dacite dome (watchman Dacite); these were the last known phases of volcanism in the area (upper Pl - ?Sc, lower to mid Miocene). Macrofaunas have been collected from seventy-six localities in the Waitakere Hills. These can be divided into undisplaced bathyal biocoenoses and displaced thanatocoenoses in which neritic and bathyal faunas were mixed during subaqueous mass flow transport. Analysis of these faunas allows recognition of ten neritic and three bathyal macrofaunal biofacies. Remains of the crustacean Callianassa are recorded. From burrow networks (Thalassinoides) developed in bathyal sediments. Sparse ichnocoenoses composed entirely of feeding and dwelling structures produced by burrowing polychaetes, echinoids and possibly sipunculids occur in basin (mid - lower bathyal) and submarine canyon (outer neritic - upper bathyal) sediments around Maori Bay. A canyon wall ichnocoenosis (outer neritic &#8211; upper bathyal), produced in semi-consolidated sediments by burrowing polychaetes, decapod crustacea and possibly amphipods and other organisms, occurs south of Maori Bay. Twelve species from nine genera of hermatypic (reef-building) corals occur in mass flow deposits. They are inferred to have come from sporadically developed communities growing on shallow-water boulder banks around volcanic islands. Comparison of the total lower Miocene hermatypic coral fauna of Northland with present day reefs indicates that seasonal sea termperatures were 5 - 7&#176;c warmer than now. Taxonomic descriptions of fossil corals, molluscs, polychaetes, benthonic foraminifera and trace fossils are given. Archesabella bartrumi gen. et sp. nov. is proposed for fossil tubes containing the body casts of sabellid-like worms. The hermatypic coral genus Goniastrea, trace fossil genus Rhizocorallium, and molluscan subgenera Dentalium (Gadilina), Solariella (Solaricida) and Turbo (Marmarostoma), are recorded from New Zealand for the first time. A new subgenus and species of the gastropod Monilea and new species of the gastropod genera Conacmea, Notoacmea (Parvacmea), Tecticrater, solariella (Solaricida), Turbo (Marmarostoma), Agathirses, "Bartrumella" and Vaqinella are described. A new genus and species of nuculanid bivalve, and new species of the mollusca Nucula, Saccella, Dentalium (Gadilina), Turbo (Marmarostoma), Agathirses, Argobuccinum (Ratifusus), Uttleya and Concholepas are but not named. The New Zealand species of the pteropod Vaginella are redescribed and figured, and the ontogeny of the oyster Crenostrea, discussed. The foraminiferal genus Sherbornina is recorded from New Zealand for the first time, together with thirty-nine overseas species. A further seventeen unnamed foraminiferal species are described. Planktonic foraminifera allow division of the Manukau Subgroup into three biostratigraphic units: upper otaian, lower altonian and mid Altonian. Three-fold subdivision of Scott's Altonian is shown to be possible in northern New Zealand. The lower - middle Altonian boundary is based on the Globorotalia (T.) zealandica zealandica datum, supported by both the temporary absence of Globoguadrina dehiscens and the measurements on the rate of chamber expansion in Globigerinoides t. trilobus populations. The middle &#8211; upper Altonian boundary is taken as the Globorotalia (G.) miozea miozea datum, supported by both the reappearance of G. dehiscens and the rate of chamber expansion measurements. Uniformitarian and computer approaches allow the thirty-one richest benthonic foraminiferal samples to be grouped into eight neritic and bathyal thanatotopes. Separate analysis of each thanatotope enables approximate depth limits to be placed on each and gives basin depths of 1500 - 3000 m+. Multidimensional scaling technique using Edwards Great Circle distances was found to be the most useful computer method in clustering the samples. Formations of the Waipoua Subgroup are summarised, and the paleogeography and eruptive history of the Waitakere Group is inferred.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular genetics of restriction fragment length polymorphisms linked to the Huntington disease locus</field><field name="creator">Stapleton, Patricia M. (Patricia Mary)</field><field name="description">New Zealand families segregating the Huntington disease (HD) phenotype were investigated for linkage of the HD locus to the anonymous DNA locus G8, from chromosome 4p16.3. Linkage of the two loci was indicated in the largest family assessed. The results from this family together with those from 10 other smaller families were consistent with the existence of a single locus (that is, genetic homogeneity for HD). One crossover between the HD locus and the G8 marker locus was detected. Overall, the results of the linkage analysis indicate a distance of 4cM separating HD from G8. The usefulness of G8 as a marker in predictive testing for HD was examined in the New Zealand families. In agreement with overseas findings, G8 and DNA contiguous with G8 are useful for predictive testing in some families. The main limitation for predictive testing is the family structure which often results in the unavailability of key individuals for testing and thus prevents prediction in others. Sequence analysis of three sites which produce restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected by G8 revealed that single point mutations were responsible for the presence or absence of the polymorphic sites *H1, *H2 and *E. The sequences were highly conserved between individuals in the regions investigated. The conservation of sequence provided the potential for the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify each polymorphic region for more rapid assessment of these RFLPs. The three regions were amplified successfully from genomic DNA. In addition, amplification of the three regions was possible with template DNA which was degraded or crude or isolated from tissue which had been fixed in formalin. However, the results of the subsequent analyses of the amplified products by restriction enzyme digestion showed that there are problems that can render the PCR unreliable. The presence of non-target sequences hindered detection of the genotype in the *H1 and *H2 regions and masked the true genotype of a person in the *E region. Thus, the potential of the PCR for presymptomatic diagnosis of HD remains to be realised. However, when the problems are overcome a very rapid analysis of RFLPs linked with HD using the PCR will be possible, as will be retrospective analyses.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polarographic studies in the anthraquinone series</field><field name="creator">Sprott, Thomas James</field><field name="description">Polarographic chemical analysis, although invented only twenty-five years ago, has already become a standard method ror the research worker and industrial analyst alike.

R. (Paul R.)</field><field name="description">Several ecological aspects of the Manukau Harbour related to its benthic flora end fauna, water chemistry, sedimentology, and bacteriology were investigated. Vertical colour aerophotographs were taken of all vegetated tidelands within the Harbour and six vegetation types were indentified, mapped, and discussed in terms of their ecological significance. Meadows of the intertidal seaweed Gracilaria secundata var. pseudoflagellifera near the Manukau Sewage Oxidation Ponds were found to have increased virtually logarithmically in extent since the commencement of operations of the Manukau Purification Works. The possible relation of this increase to contributions of mutrients and fine sediments from the Ponds is considered. The effects of stress, sediment type, and the presence of macrovegetation on benthic faunal community structure are studied. The majority of the findings are somewhat inconclusive; however it is found that mangrove swamps and eelgrass flats clearly appear to increase faunal species diversity. Water and sediment nutrients were examined and found to be at high levels in the north-east region of the Harbour. It is concluded that sediments probably undergo less temporal variation in nutrient levels than do overlying waters and might therefore provide a more cost-effective method of studying cultural eutrophication in the Manukau and similar harbours. Sediment particle size distribution was looked at and it was determined that sediments are extremely fine near the Manukau Sewage Oxidation Ponds, coarser but still muddy in most of the inlets of the Harbour, and sandy in most of the open Harbour intertidal flats remote from pollution sources. Counts of coliform bacteria were made and levels in intertidal sediments were found to be generally higher than in overlying waters but not less temporally variable. It was also determined that waters and sediments of the north-east region of the Harbour are of poor sanitary quality. Several management considerations are discussed in relation to the results of the study. Further research needs are outlined terms of 22 research projects addressed to waste water management, land erosion control, and tidelands managements.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfumes related to ambergris.

Its interest to this Departmen arose from its abundant, occurrence in Coprosma species, most of which are native to New Zealand. Since the aglycone of asperuloside is now known to possess the carbon skeleton (1) , asperuloside may be formally regarded as monoterpenoid. This Introduction therefore considers the structures, interrelationships, and biogenesis of cyclopentanoid monoterpenoids possessing the 1,2-dimethyl-3-isopropylcyc clopentane carbon skeleton (1). Cyclopentanoid Monoterpenoids: Although acyclic and cyclohexanoid monoterpenoids have been characterised for nearly eight years, naturally occurring compounds possessing the carbon skeleton (1) have been defined relatively recently. Despite their frequently unusual chemical behaviour and physiological actions, which have often been recorded in the early literature, progress in the elucidation of their structures has awaited the application of modern physical techniques. The carbon skeletons are frequently highly oxygenated, and the characteristic chemistry of the compounds arises from the interactions of contiguous functional groups.

L. (Carol Anne Lillias)</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the behavioural ecology of the tui, Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae, a member of the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), in the suburban Auckland region of the mainland of New Zealand. Tui are highly nectarivorous but observations show differences in degree of importance between the three food categories; nectar, fruit and insects according to season. when foraging for nectar tui are not responsive to flower colour but use all flowers with nectar concentrations greater than 7% (wt. per wt.) and use fruit when nectar availability falls. Foraging observations are significantly different for male and female tui with males taking more nectar and females taking more insects, in response to greater protein requirement as well as a result of status affecting foraging. There is also a seasonal difference in method of prey capture with the more energetically expensive hawking occurring in times of greater nectar availability or when very few insects in relation to nectar are taken. Colour-banded tui are shown to move in family groups over distances ranging from 5 to 35km in search of nectar for much of the year, but are localised into small foraging areas during breeding when nectar is abundant. Group members remain together and nest near each other, female offspring nesting closer to parents than male offspring. There is differential access to both natural and artificial food resources and the various asymmetries of sex, age and residency determine relative status at food sources but are not absolute. Loud song is the most conspicuous behaviour and is used to mediate avoidance between individuals and between groups. An artificial food source is partitioned temporally and spatially during breeding with the local higher status birds that use the feeders having significantly greater breeding success. Unlike results published for most passerines, both sexes of tui sing throughout the year and songs in their repertoire show sexual, seasonal, behavioural and individual variation. Pairs duet and both sexes will match songs with mates and with neighbours; resulting in apparent dialect areas corresponding with group boundaries. Avian spirochaetosis is identified as one of the causes of death in a population with 13-30% annual loss. Losses are readily compensated for as the nesting cycle is short and the breeding season is long. This, together with an opportunistic foraging strategy, great mobility and prolonged association in family groups explains the continued presence of tui in suburban areas.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of geomagnetic micropulsations</field><field name="creator">Fraser-Smith, A.

Assuming the production of Alfv&#233;n waves by some process in the magnetosphere, a layer model is developed to investigate the transmission of these waves down along the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field lines to the ionosphere. One feature of this model is a realistic ionospheric termination, in which a phase shift and amplitude reduction may be introduced into back reflected waves.

Subjects were placed in small for gestational age, pre-term appropriate for gestational age, control, pre-term small for gestational age, low birth weight with gastroenteritis and very low birth weight groups. Assessment was blind and, where necessary, groups were randomly selected. Data were gathered from four stages of the subjects&#8217; development; the pregnancy, the newborn period, pre-school and school age. Analysis of pregnancy data showed that some aspects of the intrauterine environment provided by a number of mothers was less than optimal. In the neonatal period, the low birth weight groups were at some disadvantage and, further, there were aspects where there was some evidence that either the treatment or the condition for which it was required could possiblY influence subsequent development. The pre-school period was marked by sex differences, particularly in cognitive functioning. Disadvantage in all instances was confined to the low birth weight male groups. Some events in the prenatal, perinatal and neonatal periods appeared to be associated with poorer performance on intelligence tests more than four years later. Among these influences were mothers' smoking habits, temperature, duration of tube feeding and gastroenteritis while in hospital. Assessment at school revealed the same pattern of cognitive development among the subgroups that had been apparent at the pre-school stage. The pre-term males found adjustment to school difficult and made slow progress in reading in comparison with the females belonging to the same group. At this age the term - small for gestational age group was still lagging behind in physical development. It was concluded that the low birth weight males constituted a group who were &#8216;at risk&#8217; because of slower cognitive development.

This enables a more comprehensive understanding of curriculum and unearths connections with what Lyotard (1984) described as 'grand narrative' used to legitimate knowledge claims and practices at certain historical moments. Through such histories we may chart the progress of European civilization within the local context and provide the historical raison d'&#195;&#170;tre for the present state of affairs in music and arts areas of the New Zealand curriculum. Curriculum and its 'reform' representing in part the distribution of public goods and services, has been embroiled in a market project. I seek to expose the politics of knowledge involved in the construction of the notion of The Arts within a neo-liberal policy environment. This environment has involved the deliberate construction of a 'culture of enterprise and competition' (Peters, 1995: 52) and, in the nurturing of conditions for trans-national capital's freedom of movement, a withdrawal from Keynesian economic and social policy, an assault on the welfare state. The thesis delves beyond the public face of policy-making. It follows and scrutinizes critically the birth of The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum to the production of the first draft of the proposed policy presented by the Ministry of Education in 1999. I examine it as a site of the 'accumulation of meaning' (Derrida, 1981: 57) through a discussion of the history of meaning of 'art' and 'art' education. There is much of value in the Draft document. In particular, the arts have been invested with a new intellectual weight and the professionalism, passion and dedication of those involved in its writing shines through in each of the subject areas within the arts. However, through a process of analysis, I will show that there has been, in fact, a fashioning of a new container for the isolation of artistic knowledge. This is despite official sentiments mentioning possibilities within the document for flourishing separate Music, Art, Dance, and Drama education that implies increased curriculum space. The Draft Arts (1999) document both disguises and rehashes the 'master narrative' of universal rationality and artistic canons and is unlikely to work towards revitalising or protecting local cultural identities though not through lack of intention. I use Lyotard's notion of 'performativity' to critique notions of 'skills' and their 'development' which are implicitly and explicitly stated within the 'levels' of development articulated in the Draft Arts (1999) document. It is argued that this conflation works to enforce cultural homogeneity. There are clear dangers that the Draft Arts' (1999) conception of 'Arts Literacies' might operate as mere functional literacy in the service of the dominant culture's discourse of power and knowledge-one which celebrates the art-as-commodity ideal. It is argued that the Education Ministry's theoretical and epistemological construction of The Arts as one area of learning is unsound, and in fact represents a tightening of modernism's hierarchical notion of culture. New Zealand, now post-colonial or post-imperialist, both bi-cultural and multi-cultural, is situated on the south-western edge of the Pacific Rim. Culturally, it now includes Pacific Island, Asian, and new immigrants, as well as Maori and people of European descent. This therefore necessitates aesthetic practices which, far from promoting a set of universal principles for the appreciation of art - one canonical rule or 'standard' - recognise and reflect cultural difference. Merely admitting cultural difference is inadequate. By working away critically at the deeply held ethno-centric assumptions of modernism, its selective traditions concerned with 'practices, meanings, gender, "races", classes' (Pollock, 1999: 10), its universalising aesthetics of beauty, formal relations, individuality, authenticity or originality, and self-expression, of 'negativity and alienation, and abstraction' (Huyssens, 1986: 209), it is possible to begin to understand the theoretical task of articulating difference with regard to aesthetics. The development of the arts curriculum in New Zealand is placed within the modernism/postmodernism and modernity/postmodernity debates. These debates have generated a number of questions which are forcing us to re-examine the assumptions of modernism. The need for the culture of modernism to become self-critical of its own determining assumptions in order to come to understand its cultural practices, is becoming an urgent theoretical task, especially in disciplines and fields concerned with the transmission of acquired learning and the production of new knowledge. The culture of modernism is often taken as the historical succession of twentieth century avant-gardes (B. Smith, 1998) yet the culture of modernity, philosophically speaking, strictly begins with Ren&#195;&#169; Descartes several hundred years earlier, with a pre-history in the Florentine renaissance and the re-discovery of Graeco-Roman artistic and literary forms going back to the thirteenth century. Aesthetic modernism identifies with consumer capitalism and its major assumptions are rationalist, individualist and focus upon the autonomy of both the 'work of art' and the artist at the expense of the artwork, its reception and audience within its localised cultural context. The ideological features of humanism/liberalism - its privileging of the individual subject, the moral, epistemological and aesthetic privileging of the author/artist - are examined as forces contributing to modernism's major values (or aesthetic). Such approaches, it is argued, were limited for dealing with difference. The security and reproductive nature of modernistic approaches to curriculum in the arts areas are destabilized by thinking within the postmodern turn, and the effects of the changes questioning the basic epistemological and metaphysical assumptions in disciplinary fields including art/literature, artchitecture, philosophy and political theory, are registered here, within the field of the education in and through the arts. In a seminal description or report on knowledge, Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard defines postmodernism as 'incredulity towards metanarratives' (1984: xxiv). Postmodernism, he argues, is 'undoubtedly part of the modern', 'not modernism at its end but in its nascent state and that state is constant (1984: 79). After Lyotard, postmodernism might be seen, therefore, not just as a mode or manner or attitude towards the past, but also as a materializing discourse comprising a dynamic reassessment and re-examination of modernism and modernity's culture. The thinking subject (the cogito) seen as the fount of all knowledge, its autonomy, and transparency, its consideration as the centre of artistic and aesthetic virtuosity and moral action, is subjected to intellectual scrutiny and suspicion. The need for an aesthetics of difference is contextualised through an examination of western hierarchies of art and the aesthetics of marginalized groups. I use the theories of poststructuralist, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard, to examine the concept of difference. These theoretical inspirations are used as methodological tools for offsetting the privileging of the liberal individual and individualism. Rather than the mere consideration of difference in curricula, I seek to insert and establish the principle of an aesthetics of difference into relations of pedagogy and curricula. The implications for professional practice resulting from a recognition of a politics of representation are examined and a politics of difference. I argue that art education in all its manifestations can no longer avoid the deeper implications of involvement with representation, including forms of gender, ethnicity and class representation as well as colonial representation. The Western canon's notion of 'artists' and their 'art', often based upon white bourgeois male representations and used in many primary school classrooms, are part and parcel of 'social and political investments in canonicity', a powerful 'element in the hegemony of dominant social groups and interests' (Pollock, 1999: 9). Difference is not appreciated in this context. School art, music, and drama classrooms can become sites for the postmodern questioning of representation of 'the other'. In this context, an aesthetics of difference insists upon too, the questioning of images supporting hegemonic discourses, images which have filled the spaces in the 'chinks and cracks of the power/knowledge-apparati' (Teresa de Lauretis, 1987 cited in Pollock, 1999: 7-8). What would an 'eccentric rereading', a rediscovery of what the canon's vicarly cloak disguises and reveals, mean for music, and for the individual arts areas of the curriculum? I hope to reveal the entanglements of the cultural dynamics of power through an examination of the traditions of Truth and Beauty in imagery which are to be disrupted by inserting into the canon the principle of the aesthetics of difference. Art education as a politics of representation embraces art's constitutive role in ideology. This is to be exposed as we seek to unravel and acknowledge which kinds of knowledges are legitimised and privileged by which kinds of representations. Which kinds of narratives, historical or otherwise, have resulted in which kinds of depictions through image? A recognition of the increasing specification of the subject demands also the careful investigation of colonial representation, the construction of dubious narratives about our history created through visual imaging and its provision of complex historical references. How have art, music, dance, drama been used in the service of particular political and economic narratives? Through revisioning the curriculum from a postmodern perspective, suggestions are made for an alternative pedagogy, which offsets the ideological features of humanism/liberalism, one in which an aesthetics of difference might pervade cultural practices - 'systems of signification', 'practices of representation' (Rizvi, 1994). I draw upon Lyotard's notion of 'small narratives' (1984), and present an investigation of what the democratic manifestation of 'the differend', and multiple meaning systems, might indicate in terms of 'differencing' music education as a site in which heterogenous value systems and expression may find form.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geography of power resources in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Bryan H.</field><field name="description">For a century the development of power resources has contributed much to the geography of New Zealand.  Today, more than ever before, the direct significance of energy production is seen, at the mine or dam site, on the road or railway, and indirectly in the home, the farm, and the factory.  Nor is the situation static.  Large dams and associated villages stand in areas which only a decade ago were remote and uninhabited, lakes are being drained and swamps reclaimed in the search for coal, and a man-made thermal area has been created, as spectacular as any natural one.  Plans are made and changed, and before one large power development is completed another has been commenced.  Energy is outstandingly important in the daily lives of New Zealanders yet only meagre information is available on New Zealand power resources and still less on the geography of those areas characterised by power resources and their exploitation.</field><field name="date">1960</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of coordination compounds of nickel with some diamines.</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Neil Ferguson</field><field name="description">The coordination compounds of many transition metals can exist in two form with differing magnetic moments.

Whale and others at the Seagrove Radio Research Station (now the Radio Research Centre, University of Auckland), to the examination of some of the problems involved in HF radio propagation. Among these were the evaluation of the effects of large-scale ionospheric tilts, the scattering which occurs at the earth and ionosphere, and the measurement and prediction of incoming bearing and elevation angles of signals from distant stations. In the latter stages of this work it became obvious that little was known about effects occurring at antipodal distances, so attempts were made to examine these and to postulate a propagation model consistent with the effects observed. The results presented in this thesis are a logical extension of this early work, and comprise investigations in three main areas: (1) The shape and size of the antipodal focussing area, (2) The development of a more general and less idealised propagation model, (3) The shape of the incoming angular power spectrum at antipodal distances. A summary of the theory and experimental results contained in chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 has been published (Bold, 1969), and that contained in chapters 8 and 9 will be submitted for publication shortly.</field><field name="date">1970</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Xray diffraction Study of a diterpene</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Bryan Frederick</field><field name="description">The diterpene hydrocarbon rimuene has exercised over the years, the interest of a number of laboratories engaged in natural product research. As is usual with this class of compound its occurrence is confined almost entirely to the native New Zealand flora and although only two types of tree have been used as sources, it has been identified, often only in small amounts, in at least ten different species. Its co-occurrence with other diterpenes of similar chemical and physical properties has often made it hard to isolate and this, together with its geographic distribution has probably tended to limit its availability for research purposes, and hence delayed the elucidation of its structure. The awareness of the existence of this compound of undetermined structure has, therefore, caused a noticable gap in the knowledge of the diterpenoids, and this hiatus has been accentuated by Wenkert who, believing it to have a pimarane skeleton, suggested that it might be the important biogenetic precursor of a number of tetracyclic diterpenoids. Recent work, confirmed by the present investigation has, however, shown that previous structural predictions were incorrect and in actual fact rimuene has a rosane skeleton. As Ruzicka has shown for this class of compound, it has probably been formed from a pimarane diterpenoid and therefore represents a later biogenetic step than the other diterpene hydrocarbons which are always found with it in nature.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The crystal structures of the bromo and chloro derivatives of picrotoxinin / Bryan Maxwell Craven</field><field name="creator">Craven, Bryan Maxwell</field><field name="description">Picrotoxin is the bitter tasting convulsive poison, obtained from the cocculus berries, the fruit of  the East Indian creepers, Menispermum cocculus and Anamirta paniculata.

From this analysis 20 taxa are recognised as constituting the New Zealand Monotis fauna, with the future possible addition of two further taxa. M. richmondiana Zittel, claimed by some overseas workers as a junior synonym of M. ochotica (Keyserling), is established as validly separable and is seen to include Trechmann's (1918) Pseudomonotis ochotica var. acutecostata as a subspecies. The presence of the New Caledonian M. routhieri and M. ochotica gigantea (Avias, 1953) is confirmed and the latter is transferred to M. subcircularis Gabb. Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica and var. intermedia (of Trechmann, 1918) are reinstated as valid taxa and given full specific rank. M. calvata Marwick (1953) is retained as a full species. In addition, the following species and subspecies are proposed: awakinoensis, kiritehereensis, maniapotoi, marwicki, murihikuensis, murihikuensis taringatura, pinensis aotearoa, rauparaha, rauparaha aries, rauparaha mokaui, subcircularis discordans, wairakae, and warepana. Only Pseudomonotis richmondiana var. truncata Frech (1908) amongst names previously proposed for New Zealand Monotis is rejected as a nomen dubium; it is probably synonymous with M. richmondiana acutecostata (Trechmann). The species-group concept of Westermann (1973b) is formalised by the proposal of five subgeneric divisions to accommodate the 55 definite and up to 5 possible taxa included in the genus. The subgenera Monotis, Entomonotis Marwick (type: M. richmondiana), Eomonotis n.subgen. (type: Pseudomonotis scutiformis var. typica Kiparisova), Inflatomonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica Trechmann), and Maorimonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis routhieri) are differentiated on the basis of adult size, prominence and sculpture of the posterior auricle, the degree to which it is separated from the disc, shell inflation, radial ribbing and shell thickness. Eomonotis is the oldest subgenus and the stem-stock for the others; it probably evolved from Otapiria. It is unclear from morphologic evidence whether Monotis (s.s.) and Entomonotis developed one from the other or both from Eomonotis independently. Maorimonotis is confidently believed to have sprung from an Entomonotis similar to M. pachypleura (Teller) and Inflatomonotis is most likely to have evolved from an Eomonotis with strongly inflated left valve (e.g. M. jakutica (Teller) or M. iwaiensis Ichikawa). Eomonotis and Entomonotis are geographically the most widespread, the former being absent only from the Andean area of Monotis distribution and Entomonotis not having been recorded in the western or central Tethys. Monotis (s.s.) is common only in the western Tethys. Inflatomonotis and Maorimonotis are confined to New Zealand-New Caledonia except for one record of the former in British Columbia. In many regions the stratigraphic sequence of Monotis is too inadequately known for evolutionary sequences to be deduced but some examples of chronologic and geographic subspeciation are pinpointed. The only clearly defined lineage is that within Maorimonotis from maniapotoi through awakinoensis and routhieri to calvata. The genus can be seen to have a high taxonomic diversity and rapid rate of evolution. Apart from three questionable lower Triassic and lower Jurassic species, Monotis is confined to the Norian Stage, and possibly to the Columbianus and Suessi Zones of the mid and upper Norian. Monotis is postulated as having been epibyssate throughout life and normally epiplanktonic on drifting or floating marine vegetation, with coexisting taxa occupying different microenvironments on different parts of the plants. A serious objection to this mode of life is the massive algal production necessary to provide a substrate for the tremendous numbers of individuals involved in Monotis shellbeds. Reduction of the byssal ear in Maorimonotis is seen as a significant event and coupled with the trend to an equivalved condition is interpreted as indicating change to an endobyssate benthic existence for M. routhieri and calvata; this adequately explains the restricted distribution of this subgenus. Detailed stratigraphic analysis of Monotis in Murihiku sequences necessitates rejection of the Rocky Dome section as stratotype for the Warepan Stage on the grounds that although M. richmondiana has been cited as the marker fossil for the stage, past usage has clearly equated the base of the stage with the incoming of the genus, and richmondiana is not the oldest member of the genus to be found in Murihiku sections. Earlier members are absent from the stratotype which therefore must be relocated in order to retain the stage in its accepted scope. The Kiritehere coastal section suffers the disadvantage of penecontemporaneous submarine slumping, but is proposed as stratotype for a new Marakopan Stage because it is the thickest, best exposed, clearest and best known sequence of Monotis beds and adjacent strata in New Zealand. Within this stage a sequence of five formal and three informal chronozones is defined. The lower Marakopan Mokaui and Murihikuensis Chronozones can be grouped together as an Eomonotis chronozone when faunas are too poor for better correlation, and similarly the overlying Acutecostata, Richmondiana and Calvata Chronozones can be grouped as an Entomonotis chronozone. In addition a topmost Marakopan chronozone can be recognised from the absence of Monotis and basal Otapirian indicators and the presence of a fauna which at present seems common to the two stages. Monotis is the most common fossil in the Torlesse Super-group and the lower four Chronozones, and probably also the Calvata Chronozone, are all represented. Most forms present in Murihiku rocks are also present in Torlesse, but two common Torlesse forms are unknown in Murihiku sequences and this is believed to indicate both communication and barriers between the two regions in Marakopan times. Monotis-bearing Torlesse lithologies are more varied than Murihiku and indicate different depositional regimes. Whilst Murihiku Marakopan strata are all of normal clastic lithologies and show a southwards increase in grain-size, the Torlesse picture is more complex. Firstly, an increasingly deeper and offshore situation is suggested by some deposits with Murihiku faunas: inner or middle neritic origin for Monotis-bearing clasts in a (?) late Jurassic conglomerate at Morrinsville which possibly accumulated in the outer neritic zone or slightly deeper, outer neritic for in situ strata near Aria, slightly further offshore accumulation for ? middle Jurassic m&#233;lange in the Oroua Valley and Marakopan slump deposits in the Otaki Gorge, and bathyal or even abyssal deposition for argillites with scattered Monotis in the Mt Arthur-Bealey area. The Aria Monotis beds lie west of the Waipa Fault, yet fit best into Kear's (1967, 1971) Morrinsville Facies, and indicate that the Hakarimata Anticline, Waipa Fault and the facies relations postulated by Kear date from the mid-Jurassic and that there was no feature like the modern continental edge and slope during upper Triassic times in the region. Close paleogeographic relations between these areas and the Murihiku region in Marakopan times is indicated and is not disproven by any sedimentologic evidence yet known. One lithologic association not represented in and showing distinct geographic separation from the Murihiku area is the shell limestone-submarine lava-chert association, which is that containing Monotis species endemic to the Torlesse. This is postulated as having been formed in localised offshore shoal areas (guyots) formed by submarine volcanism; even these regions had some connection with Murihiku seas.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocular delivery of antisense oligonucleotides using colloidal Carriers: improving the wound repair after corneal surgery</field><field name="creator">Rupenthal, Ilva Dana</field><field name="description">Background and Aim: Clinical outcomes of refractive surgeries are variable due to individual wound healing responses, but might be improved by effective delivery of anti-inflammatory agents. Knockdown of connexin proteins, using an antisense oligonucleotide (AsON) approach, has been shown to significantly reduce the inflammatory response and increase the rate of wound closure after corneal laser surgery. The challenge remains to find delivery systems that are easy to apply, but can still effectively deliver the AsONs to the target site. This thesis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of several in-situ gelling formulations to deliver Cx43 AsONs to the wounded tissues of a rat corneal scrape wound model. Methods: Formulations were characterised in terms of their rheological behaviour, microstructure and spreading ability. They were then evaluated for their irritation potential, precorneal retention and ability to control the release of the model hydrophilic drug pilocarpine hydrochloride both in vitro and in vivo. The stability of the AsONs in these formulations was assessed using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. Finally, formulations containing the stable AsONs were applied to a rat corneal scrape wound model and penetration depth, wound size after 12 hours and cellular dynamics underlying the wound healing response were analysed. Results and Discussion: Systems based on gellan gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan and alginate underwent sol-to-gel phase transition upon addition of the cations present in tear fluid. All tested systems exhibited favourable contact angles and were found to be non-irritant. Systems based on gellan gum, xanthan gum and carrageenan showed the longest ocular retention and exhibited the slowest release characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. AsONs were found to be stable in all formulations apart from the chitosan system, where precipitation occurred. This formulation also exhibited the slowest wound healing rate due to induction of a pro-inflammatory response. Conversely, delivery of the AsONs by gellan gum and carrageenan formulations resulted in significant reduction in wound size, inflammatory response and Cx43 levels. Conclusion: In-situ gelling systems based on gellan gum and carrageenan are able to successfully deliver Cx43 AsONs to the wounded tissues and therefore improve the healing response after corneal surgery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of DFO derivatives and their application to fingermark detection</field><field name="creator">Ramachandran, Sumankalai</field><field name="description">1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) is one of the most common reagents used to enhance latent fingermarks on porous substrates. However, this compound is slower to react than similar reagents, and also does not always react to completion. This thesis investigated methods to address these problems. The reaction of DFO with fingermarks has been widely studied phenomenologically, but there are few studies focusing on the chemistry of the reaction. Since the accepted mechanism for the reaction of DFO with amino acids shows that DFO reacts in a 2: 1 stoichiometry with primary amino acids, linking two DFO moieties into one molecule could provide the following advantages: First, the two DFO moieties are maintained in close proximity thus increasing the chance that both can react with a single amino acid. Second, fluorescence is dependent on the overall flexibility of the molecule, so a bridged DFO dimer could lead to a more rigid product exhibiting greater fluorescence. Finally, a cyclic product should be less susceptible to hydrolysis. The synthetic route taken to synthesise DFO dimers involved five steps. The first step, synthesis of the mono-N-oxide of DFO, proceeded cleanly and in good yields. The second step involved the introduction of a halogen (chlorine and bromine) at the 2-position of the N-oxide. The 2-chloro DFO was prepared cleanly and in good yields from the N-oxide, while the 2-bromo derivative was prepared from the 2-chloro derivative via 2-amino DFO. After protection of the carbonyl functional group (using acetals) the 2-halo DFO intermediates were reacted with selected diols in basic conditions to form bridged dimers. The final step involved deprotection of the acetal to give the carbonyl functional group. Four bridged DFO dimers were synthesised. Crystal structures supporting two of these compounds were obtained, while most of the intermediate compounds in the synthetic route were characterised by NMR and mass spectrometry. Reaction of alanine with the dimer synthesised with a 2,2'-dimethyl-propane-1,3-diol bridge leads to a colour change similar to that seen with DFO. This suggests that the bridged analogues do react with amino acids and can therefore potentially be used as alternatives to DFO. Characterisation of the product with L-alanine was difficult as mass spectrometry indicated that it was polymeric. Attempted reactions at low concentrations of both the dimer and the amino acid did not lead to the formation of the desired cyclic product and in most instances, no reaction occurred. Attempts at metal ion templating also were unsuccessful, possibly since metal ions can catalyse hydrolysis of the product and intermediates during the reaction with amino acids. The products obtained from the reaction of L-alanine with a series of 2-substituted monomeric DFO compounds had similar absorbance and fluorescence spectra to the unsubstituted product, although they showed decreased fluorescence intensity in solution. Studies on porous substrates also indicated that none of the derivatives showed higher fluorescence than DFO upon reaction with fingermarks. However, the halo- derivatives appeared less susceptible to hydrolysis. The imine of DFO is stable in ethanol: acetic acid and reacts about 10 times more rapidly with L-alanine than does DFO at 60 oC and 78 oC, suggesting that the imine might allow development of fingermarks at lower temperature than required for DFO. However, when a fingermark on paper was treated with DFO and DFO imine, the DFO imine treated fingermark did not show significantly more colour or fluorescence than that with DFO treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-scale effects on deformation mechanisms of polymer nanocomposites : experimental characterisation and numerical study</field><field name="creator">Dong, Yu, 1977-</field><field name="description">In order to make much stiffer, light weight and high performance material products, polymer nanocomposites play an emerging role in the material innovation. Unlike other thermoplastics, polymer nanocomposites are fabricated by introducing a small amount of solid nano-scale fillers (normally less than 5 wt%) such as nanoclay, carbon nanotubes or nanofibres into a plastic resin to dramatically enhance its stiffness, strength and thermal properties. The difference between nanocomposites and conventional fibre composites is that the added fillers are extremely small, only one-millionth of a millimetre thick, and provide a much larger interface area per unit volume for greatly improving the interfacial bonding effect between nanofillers and the polymer matrix.      More importantly, polypropylene (PP)/clay nanocomposites have quite a high potential to form such innovative materials and replace the conventional plastics in many automotive and packaging applications. Nevertheless, the growth of PP/clay nanocomposites faces an obstacle of hydrophobic polymer&#8217;s low interactions with hydrophilic clay. Maleic anhydride (MA) grafted PP (MAPP), commonly used as a compatibiliser, has been proven to facilitate a good clay dispersion within the PP matrix through its functionalised MA groups. But despite the great attention from the manufacturers and researchers in recent years,commercial PP/clay nanocomposites with reliable material properties are still limited in availability. The major problem stems from the complex influences of the material selection and processing methods.      The present work developed a comprehensive approach from the material formulation and processing, experimental characterisation to the numerical modelling of PP/clay nanocomposites based on the finite element analysis (FEA) of micro/nanostructures. Initially, effects of the material selection including the clay type and content, MAPP content and PP matrix viscosity were investigated for the mechanical property enhancement of PP/clay nanocomposites. These nanocomposites were prepared using twin screw extrusion and injection moulding processes with a well-known Taguchi design of experiments (DoE) method in order to statistically detect the significant factors for influencing their mechanical properties. The preferred material formulations were then determined by Pareto analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the technical and economic considerations. The fundamental material characterisation was also conducted on those formulated nanocomposites using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Overall mechanical properties of neat PP and corresponding nanocomposites were determined by the general tensile, flexural and impact tests. Finally, computational models were established by implementing both the representative volume element (RVE) technique and innovative object-oriented finite element (OOF) analysis to predict the tensile moduli of PP/clay nanocomposites in comparison to the experimental data and available composites theoretical models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Computer Simulation</field><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Material Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative identity: Ricoeur and early childhood education</field><field name="creator">Farquhar, Sandy</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that who we are, what we aspire to, and how we enact social and cultural practices are a result of the way we narrate stories about ourselves as both individuals and members of communities. The question &#8216;Who am I?&#8217; is frequently answered with reference to what is important to us: our commitments and what we determine as good, valuable and right. Our identity is thus inextricably woven into our understanding of life as an unfolding story, bound by an ethical commitment to what we value. In this way, understandings of narrative and identity become part of the social and cultural context of education, drawing upon complex relationships between individual and community. It is through narrative that we construct truth about ourselves in relation to others. The central concern of the thesis is the interplay between the &#8216;capable&#8217; child subject and various readings of texts that form the educational landscape in Aotearoa New Zealand: in curriculum documents with their emphasis on relationships, reciprocity, community, culture and language; and in policy documents with their emphasis on economic rationality. The thesis examines some important narratives that emerge from readings of these curriculum and policy documents, and the impact of those narratives on identity formation in early childhood education. Examined in turn are a liberal narrative, an economic narrative and a social narrative. Each of these narratives emphasises particular discourses and rationalities within education. The thesis finds these narratives inadequate to explain understandings of the self of early childhood education. The thesis argues that Ricoeur&#8217;s hermeneutical approach enables a range of narrative possibilities for early childhood education. The use of Ricoeur&#8217;s narrative theory in the thesis is twofold: a methodological approach for the study, and a critical exploration of the formation of &#8216;narrative identity&#8217; (for both the individual and the group) through an examination of selected narratives. The thesis responds to the tensions of these narratives through Ricoeur&#8217;s understandings of &#8216;intersubjectivity&#8217; and &#8216;just institutions&#8217; and provides educators with an ethical framework by promoting Ricoeur&#8217;s understandings of the &#8216;good life&#8217; and a &#8216;capable subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ricoeur</field><field name="subject">Early Childhood Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analogues of Natural Product-like Scaffolds: Synthesis of Spiroacetal Derivatives</field><field name="creator">Choi, Ka Wai</field><field name="description">Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) involves the synthesis of several synthetic targets by transforming a collection of structurally simple and similar starting materials into a collection of structurally more complex and diverse products.

It is the causative agent of many life-threatening disease states, including sepsis, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing pneumonia. S. aureus is associated with 1% of all hospital stays and estimated costs of US$9.5 billion / year (for 2000 and 2001) in the USA alone (Noskin et al., 2005). Recently, a novel family of virulence factors produced by S. aureus was identified, which share sequence and structural homology to the infamous superantigens (Arcus et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2000) &#8211; proteins that cause a range of symptoms, including food poisoning and toxic shock. This family of staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins (SSLs) includes 14 members, of which 11 (SSLs 1-11) are closely linked within a mobile genetic element, called a pathogenicity island (Kuroda et al., 2001). To date, the literature suggests that the SSLs exhibit important host immune-evasion functions that are distinct from the superantigens. SSL5 has been reported to inhibit leukocyte rolling, a key process in their recruitment to sites of infection (Bestebroer et al., 2006). SSL7 inhibits serum-mediated killing of bacteria (Langley et al., 2005). This thesis describes the investigation into the structure and function of the related protein, SSL11. The binding specificity of SSL11 has been identified as the trisaccharide Neu5Ac&#945;2-3Gal&#946;1- 4GlcNAc, where Neu5Ac is essential for interaction, whereas the NAc sidechain of GlcNAc is not, but is highly favoured. The interaction between the related carbohydrate, sialyl Lewis X (sLex, or Neu5Ac&#945;2-3Gal&#946;1-4[Fuc&#945;1-3]GlcNAc), and SSL11 has been characterised at an atomic level by X-ray crystallography. The dissociation constant of SSL11 binding to sLex was determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range. Investigation into the effects of SSL11 on neutrophils reveals that nanomolar concentrations of SSL11 inhibited neutrophil rolling on a P-selectin surface in vitro. Additionally, SSL11 was rapidly internalized, exhibited a cytoplasmic distribution and caused changes in actin, visible by 2-D gel analysis. The characterization of the interaction between SSL11 and the previously-identified ligand, Fc&#945;RI (the myeloid immunoglobulin A receptor), is also described. The dissociation constant - II - of SSL11 binding to Fc&#945;RI was determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range and was found to be sialic acid-dependent. Binding of SSL11 to Fc&#945;RI inhibited the binding of its native ligand, IgA. The sialic acid-dependent glycan-binding site of SSL11 is the sole site of interaction with the neutrophil surface, shown by neuraminidase treatment of cells and complete abrogation of binding by a site-directed functional knockout mutant. Residues involved in glycan binding were found to be conserved in SSLs 2-6, giving rise to a potential related function between this subset of the SSL family.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the character of Shakespeare: canon, authorship and attribution in eighteenth-century England</field><field name="creator">King, Edmund (Edmund George Coghill)</field><field name="description">At various points between 1709 and 1821, Shakespeare&#8217;s scholarly editors called into question the authenticity - either in whole or in part - of at least seventeen of the plays attributed to him in the First Folio. Enabled largely by Alexander Pope&#8217;s attack, in his 1723&#8211;25 edition of Shakespeare, on the Folio&#8217;s compilers, eighteenth-century textual critics constructed a canon based upon their own critical senses, rather than the &#8216;authority of copies&#8217;. They also discussed the genuineness of works that had been excluded from the 1623 Folio - Pericles, The Two Noble Kinsmen, Edward III, the Sonnets, and the poems published in The Passionate Pilgrim. Although these debates had little effect on the contents of the variorum edition - by 1821, only Pericles, the Sonnets, and the narrative poems had been added to the canon&#63719;arguments and counter-arguments about the authenticity of Shakespeare&#8217;s works continued to abound in the notes. These would, in turn, influence the opinions of new generations of critics throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this thesis, I return to these earlier canonical judgements, not in order to resuscitate them, but to ask what they reveal about eighteenth-century conceptions of authorship, collaboration, and canonicity. Authorship in the period was not understood solely in terms of &#8216;possessive individualism&#8217;. Neither were arguments over Shakespeare&#8217;s style wholly contingent upon new discourses of literary property that had developed in the wake of copyright law. Instead, I argue, the discourse of personal style that editors applied to Shakespeare emerged out of a pre-existing classical-humanist scholarly tradition. Other commentators adopted the newly fashionable language of connoisseurship to determine where Shakespeare&#8217;s authorial presence lay. Another group of scholars turned to contemporary stage manuscript practices to ascertain where, and why, the words of other speakers might have entered his plays. If, however, Shakespeare&#8217;s plays were only partly his, this implied that Shakespeare had written alongside other writers. In the last part of my thesis, I examine the efforts of eighteenth-century critics to understand the social contexts of early modern dramatic authorship. Pope represented the theatre as an engine of social corruption, whose influence had debased Shakespeare&#8217;s standards of art and language. Other eighteenth-century commentators, however, had a more positive understanding of the social aspects of authorship. Drawing on contemporary discourses of friendship and sociability, they imagined the Elizabethan stage as a friendship-based authorial credit network, where playwrights collaborated with their contemporaries in the expectation of a return on their own works. This language of sociable co-authorship in turn influenced the way in which Shakespearean collaboration was understood. Conceptions of Shakespearean authorship and canonicity in the period, I conclude, were - like authorship in the Shakespeare canon itself - not singular, but manifold and multivocal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy of corneal microstructure in inherited and acquired corneal disease</field><field name="creator">Niederer, Rachael Louise</field><field name="description">Purpose The cornea requires maintenance of clarity, shape, thickness and surface cellular integrity to retain normal vision. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) enables microstructural analysis of the in vivo cornea, allowing fresh insight into corneal microstructure in health and in inherited and acquired corneal disease. Recently, the introduction of laser scanning IVCM has utilised point scanning with coherent light to push forward the boundaries of real-time in vivo imaging. This related series of studies aimed first to validate the role of laser scanning IVCM and then to utilise laser scanning IVCM to examine corneal microstructure in normal subjects, following penetrating keratoplasty and in corneal ectasia and corneal dystrophy. Methods Subjects were assessed with slit lamp examination, corneal topography and laser scanning IVCM. Basal epithelial, sub-basal nerve plexus, keratocyte and endothelial cell and innervation density were quantified. Results Laser scanning IVCM generated high quality images of corneal microstructure. Comparison with slit scanning confocal microscopy illustrated good correlation between the two microscopes, although differences existed between optical section thickness and image contrast. High repeatability and inter-session and inter-observer reproducibility was demonstrated with laser scanning IVCM. The subsequent studies examined corneal microstructure alterations with age, following penetrating keratoplasty, and in corneal ectasia and corneal dystrophy. Laser scanning IVCM highlighted alterations at every level of the cornea and good agreement was observed between the in vivo and ex vivo results following penetrating keratoplasty. Conclusions In vivo confocal microscopy allows rapid analysis of corneal microstructure in health and disease, offering clinicians and researchers an exciting bridge between clinical and laboratory observations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders and its formation mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Kim, Esther Hee-Jung</field><field name="description">Spray-dried dairy powders are common ingredients in many food and dairy products. Some of the properties of these powders that are important in their storage, handling and final application are expected to be determined by the surface composition of the powder. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism behind the formation of the surface composition of the powder and the ability to control the surface composition will be very useful in the improvement of product quality and the development of new products. The aim of this thesis was to understand the mechanism behind the formation of the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders. To achieve this, a comprehensive research on the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders was undertaken, using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA, also known as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)). This involved the investigation of the effects of the composition of the concentrate before drying, manufacturing processes, processing conditions and storage on the surface composition of the powder. The distribution of milk components (including triglycerides in milk fat) within the powder particles was also investigated to obtain further insight in the processes occurring within the particles during powder production. It was found that the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders (skim milk powder, whole milk powder, cream powder and whey protein concentrate) is significantly different from the bulk composition. Particularly pronounced was the accumulation of fat on the powder surface, deteriorating several powder properties (flowability, wettability and oxidative stability). The fat content of the powder appeared to be the critical factor in determining the surface composition of the powder. Results showed that there is redistribution of components within the particles during the spray-drying process. A kind of solid/solute segregation seems to occur. Fat and proteins are preferentially accumulated near the surface of the particles whereas lactose in the interior of the particles. It was also observed that there is some fractionation among the different milk fat present in the powders, with the accumulating of high melting triglycerides in the free-fat and even more at the surface of the powders. The redistribution of components was found to be affected to a large extent by the spray-drying conditions employed (feed solids content, drying temperatures and degree of homogenization). The subsequent fluidized bed drying and handling processes appeared to have little effect on the surface composition of the powders. However, during long-term storage, there was a release of encapsulated low-melting triglycerides towards the surface of powder, thereby lowering the melting points of the surface free-fat and the inner free-fat. Based on the findings in this work and theoretical considerations, possible mechanisms behind the formation of the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders, from powder production, through storage, to its final application, were suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotrophoblast differentiation in the first trimester of human pregnancy</field><field name="creator">James, Joanna</field><field name="description">In the first trimester of human pregnancy specialised placental cells, termed cytotrophoblasts differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which grow out from the placenta and invade into the maternal decidua, acting to physically attach the placenta to the decidua, and adapt the uterine spiral arteries to support pregnancy. A proportion of these EVTs also temporarily occlude the spiral arteries for approximately the first 10 weeks of gestation, preventing maternal blood flow to the placenta and creating a low oxygen environment in which placental and fetal development occur. The processes of trophoblast outgrowth and invasion, and the establishment of a low oxygen environment, are essential for the success of pregnancy, and inadequate trophoblast invasion into the uterus has been associated with recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, the exact mechanisms that control the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts down the extravillous trophoblast lineage are poorly understood. Since the extent of this invasive process is unique to human implantation, animal models are of limited value in studying trophoblast invasion. Existing in vitro models have major limitations in that many are very difficult to quantify while others many not study the correct trophoblast population. The research in this thesis has focussed on the development of novel models by which to study cytotrophoblast differentiation, and the use of these models to further understand cytotrophoblast differentiation down the EVT lineage, and the regulation of EVT outgrowth by oxygen. Methods Outgrowth from first trimester villous explants was characterized using immunohistochemistry. Explant viability was investigated using dual staining with chloromethylfluorescin diacetate (CMFDA) and ethidium bromide, by examining DNA laddering, and by immunostaining sectioned explants over 96 hours of culture. The extended viability of cytotrophoblasts in multilayered cell islands in villous tips was exploited to isolate these cells using sequential trypsin digests of cultured villous explants. The trophoblast population obtained were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Finally, villous explants were cultured in either 1.5% or 8% oxygen and the frequency and area of outgrowths was quantified in order to determine the effect of gestation and oxygen on EVT outgrowth. Results Approximately 1/4 of explants cultured in 20% oxygen produced EVT outgrowth. Outgrowth formation and expansion resulted from proliferation of cells in the tips of anchoring villi, and EVTs within the outgrowth did not proliferate. The percentage of explants producing outgrowth declined as gestation increased from 8 to 12 weeks. Dual staining with CMFDA and ethidium bromide revealed degeneration of the syncytiotrophoblast by non-apoptotic mechanisms within 4 hours of culture, but this syncytiotrophoblast layer was able to be regenerated. The majority of cytotrophoblasts died within one week of culture, but despite this explants were able to produce EVT outgrowth for up to 3 weeks due to the extended survival of a specific set of cytotrophoblasts located in cell islands in the tips of anchoring villi. These surviving cells were able to differentiate into EVTs, but not regenerate the surrounding syncytiotrophoblast in the villus tip. Trypsinization of first trimester villi after extended explant culture resulted in the isolation of a viable population of &#8216;putative EVT progenitors&#8217; that did not syncytialise in culture, but were able to proliferate. 20% of these cells differentiated down the EVT lineage within 96 hours of culture. The putative EVT progenitors expressed markers previously localised to cytotrophoblasts in cell islands of anchoring villi, including &#945;v&#946;6 integrin and FGFR-2. The addition of exogenous FGF-4 did not affect the differentiation of these cells into EVTs, nor did FGF-4 alter the frequency of EVT outgrowth from explants. Culture in 1.5% oxygen significantly reduced the frequency and area of outgrowths in comparison to 8% oxygen. HLA-G and &#945;1 integrin were both expressed throughout outgrowths with no difference in expression of these proteins between oxygen concentrations. Gestation influenced the response of explants to oxygen, with a significant differential response to oxygen concentration in placentae under 11 weeks of gestation but no differential response in placentae of 11 or 12 weeks. Conclusions In the first trimester, oxygen and gestational age regulate extravillous trophoblast outgrowth in both an independent and interdependent manner. The cytotrophoblast population in the first trimester does not consist of one homogenous bipotent population. Rather there are at least two separate populations: 1) EVT progenitors that exist in the tips of potential anchoring villi that are likely to be committed to EVT differentiation and 2) monolayer villous cytotrophoblasts which are likely to be committed to syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The second population is easily isolated by traditional enzymatic digestion methods whereas the first much smaller population can be isolated by exploiting their prolonged survival in explant culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and demographic investigation of population structure and social system in four delphinid species</field><field name="creator">Oremus, Marc</field><field name="description">Population structure, genetic diversity and social system were investigated in four species of dolphins, thought to present contrasting habitat preferences and social organisation: spinner dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, long-finned and short-finned pilot whales. To overcome methodological limitations, I combined molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA, -or mtDNA-, and microsatellite loci) and observational data (photo-identification and mass strandings) where possible. Genetic samples were obtained from skin biopsies of free-ranging (n = 243) and stranded (n = 375) dolphins.  As with many species of delphinids, spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) form communities in which social and reproductive boundaries are poorly understood. In French Polynesia, capture-recapture analyses based on photographs of distinctly marked individuals (DMIs) and microsatellite genotypes (12 loci) indicated a community of about 150 dolphins around Moorea that is relatively closed on a generational time scale. Distinct communities, likely to follow a similar demographic pattern, were observed around neighbouring islands (Tahiti, Raiatea, Huahine and Bora Bora), as indicated by photo-identification data and restricted gene flow (FST = 0.143, n = 154). Surprisingly high levels of insular mtDNA genetic diversity (average pi = 1.44%, suggesting Nef ~ 100,000) contrasted with demographic characteristics of these communities. There was no evidence for a recent bottleneck effect, suggesting that this pattern is the result of metapopulation structure, based on numerous insular communities connected through male and female gene flow. Investigation of the worldwide mtDNA diversity and phylogeography of long-finned and short-finned pilot whale species revealed a complex evolutionary history (Globicephala melas, n = 434; and G. macrorhynchus, n = 134, including published and unpublished sequences). Strong genetic differentiation between long-finned pilot whales from the North Atlantic (G. m. melas) and Southern Hemisphere (G. m. edwardii) indicated severely restricted gene flow, although shared haplotypes suggested some recent contact between the two subspecies. Low genetic distances among haplotypes and a star-like phylogeny suggested a recent worldwide expansion for this species. Higher levels of diversity (although low compared to other cetaceans) were found in short-finned pilot whales, in particular among samples from around Japan. Phylogeographic studies suggested that Japanese samples originate from three distinct populations, one of which could be the ancestral population of the species. Overall, my results confirmed that worldwide mtDNA diversity is low in the two species, probably due to a recent worldwide population expansion and, potentially, to a matrilineal social structure.  The molecular ecology of the mass strandings of long-finned pilot whales around New Zealand was investigated to test the hypothesis that individuals stranding together are part of an extended matrilineal group. Analyses of mtDNA sequences indicate that more than one haplotype was found in five of the seven mass strandings investigated (n = 275), demonstrating that groups are sometimes composed of unrelated maternal lineages. This was further supported by analyses of relatedness within and between strandings based on microsatellites (14 loci). These analyses discount kinship as the only factor causing large mass strandings in long-finned pilot whales. Parentage analyses confirmed some aspects of previous studies in the North Atlantic, suggesting a social system with at least some level of male and female philopatry to the maternal group, and infrequent paternities within the group. In a detailed study of a large mass stranding (Stewart Island 2003, n = 122), there was no correlation between position of the whales on the beach and genetic relatedness (based on 20 microsatellite loci), discounting the assumption that kinship bonds are maintained during these traumatic events. This was further supported by the striking separation of stranded mothers and dependant calves. This disruption of kinship bonds could help explain the behavioural distress of stranded individuals and the tendency of many whales to re-strand even after being re-floated.  Finally, a study of rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) in the Society Archipelago, French Polynesia, provided new insights in the ecology of this poorly-known species. Although traditionally viewed as a pelagic dolphin, analyses supported a pattern of local communities, in some ways similar to spinner dolphins, with fine-scale population genetic structure (FST = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001 based on mtDNA, n = 65) and local fidelity. These communities also showed a low level of mtDNA haplotype diversity (four unique haplotypes at Moorea compared to 18 for spinner dolphins), suggesting the potential influence of a matrilineal social structure similar to long-finned pilot whales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dolphin</field><field name="subject">molecular ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeking the prize of eradication: a social history of tuberculosis in New Zealand from world War Two to the 1970s</field><field name="creator">Dunsford, Deborah, 1953-</field><field name="description">Between World War Two and the 1970s, the danger of TB disappeared for most New Zealanders. Conducted against a background of rising living standards, the anti-TB campaign saw dramatic declines in TB mortality and incidence. But tuberculosis proved far more opportunistic than expected. Its continued entrenchment at low levels among New Zealand&#8217;s poor frustrated the campaign&#8217;s ultimate goal of eradication.In the 1940s, the Health Department&#8217;s total commitment to the anti-TB campaign indicated the danger TB represented across society. The nationwide mass X-ray programme reflected the confidence in technology and medical science of the day. It operated for nearly 30 years but its value was largely symbolic. It was a costly means of identifying cases and a more targeted scheme may well have sufficed. BCG vaccination was introduced as the final block in a wall of anti-TB measures and the mass vaccination of school children sought to protect an entire at-risk age group. The timeframe of the anti-TB campaign witnessed the final years of sanatorium treatment. In spite of the isolation and uncertain outcome, these institutions offered many patients a positive experience, safe from the stigmatising attitudes common in society. The drug revolution allowed treatment at home and a reliable cure that, nevertheless, brought its own problems of compliance.The decline in TB was not shared equally. High Maori TB rates fell, but still lagged European rates and, from the 1960s, a growing Pacific Island immigrant population also challenged the goal of eradication. Attempts to control TB at the border reflected racist attitudes of the time. The Health Department grappled with the ethnic diversity of TB incidence and different cultural attitudes to the disease. Now curable, TB&#8217;s potential for stigmatisation faded, yet also persisted for those high-risk groups exposed to poverty. By the late 1970s, mainstream society was beginning to stigmatise ethnic minorities and immigrants as &#8216;responsible&#8217; for TB.This thesis contributes to the history of tuberculosis and public health in New Zealand and internationally. It reveals the shifting ground beneath a public health campaign, not just in medical developments, but in the diversity of the targeted population. The thesis highlights the need for a dynamic and layered approach to public health that anticipates change and diversity and continually adjusts its activities and messages to meet them.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel diagnostic technologies for optical communication systems</field><field name="creator">Watts, Regan Trevor</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis was to develop novel technologies for measuring the physical characteristics of high-speed pulse trains, for use in performance monitoring applications. This thesis describes the development of three separate techniques that perform measurements in either the time domain, frequency domain or the phase space of the optical signal. The first section investigates phase-sensitive pulse measurement techniques. A high- resolution SHG-FROG apparatus was custom-designed to measure 40GHz RZ pulse trains, from which an operational characterisation of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) was realised. A numerical model of a nonlinear pulse compressor was developed to compress 40GHz RZ pulses from 8.5ps down to 3.4ps. These pulses were time-division multiplexed to 80GHz, and phase-retrievals of the 80GHz pulse trains were measured. A comparison between the techniques of SHG-FROG and linear spectrogram has been undertaken for 10GHz pulse sources, exposing SHG-FROG's weaknesses at this particular repetition rate. The second section investigates a simple, time-averaged, nonlinear detection technique. Two-photon absorption in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum-well laser diode was used to measure the duty cycle (and by extension, the pulse duration) of a range of pulse sources. This technique was further developed to measure the extinction ratio of NRZ pulse trains. Additionally, the pulse duration of a mode-locked laser source was measured using the nonlinear absorption in a 1-m length of As2Se3 Chalcogenide glass fiber. This demonstrates that the nonlinear properties of this glass may well find application in future instrumentation. The third section investigates the development of an ultra-high resolution swept heterodyne spectrometer. This spectrometer was used to spectrally-distinguish repetitive 8-bit NRZ patterns at 2.5Gbit/s. It was also used to measure the chirp parameter of an X-cut LiNbO3 MZM, revealing a chirp parameter of &#945;&#960;/2 &lt; 0.1 across a modulation band- width of 250-2500MHz. Additionally, the distinctive CW spectrum of a DFB laser diode was measured. Analysis of the measured CW spectrum yielded a linewidth enhancement factor of &#945;&#8771; 1.8 and also the relative intensity noise of the DFB laser diode.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Performance Monitoring</field><field name="subject">FROG</field><field name="subject">Linear Spectrogram</field><field name="subject">Two-Photon Absorption</field><field name="subject">Chalcogenide Glass</field><field name="subject">Heterodyne Spectrometer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Input-specificity of sensory-induced neural plasticity in humans</field><field name="creator">McNair, Nicolas A.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate the input-specificity of sensory-induced plasticity in humans. This was achieved by varying the characteristics of sine gratings so that they selectively targeted distinct populations of neurons in the visual cortex. In Experiments 1-3, specificity was investigated with electroencephalography using horizontally- and vertically-oriented sine gratings (Experiment 1) or gratings of differing spatial frequency (Experiments 2 &amp; 3). Increases in the N1b potential were observed only for sine gratings that were the same in orientation or spatial frequency as that used as the tetanus, suggesting that the potentiation is specific to the visual pathways stimulated during the induction of the tetanus. However, the increase in the amplitude of the N1b in Experiment 1 was not maintained when tested again at 50 minutes post-tetanus. This may have been due to depotentiation caused by the temporal frequency of stimulus presentation in the first post-tetanus block. To try to circumvent this potential confound, immediate and maintained (tested 30 minutes post-tetanus) spatial-frequency-specific potentiation were tested separately in Experiments 2 and 3, respectively. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the increased N1b was maintained for up to half an hour post-tetanus. In addition, the findings from Experiment 1, as well as the pattern of results from Experiments 2 and 3, indicate that the potentiation must be occurring in the visual cortex rather than further upstream at the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Experiment 4 functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to more accurately localise where these plastic changes were taking place using sine gratings of differing spatial frequency. A small, focal post-tetanic increase in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was observed for the tetanised grating in the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction. For the non-tetanised grating, decreases in BOLD were found in the primary visual cortex and bilaterally in the cuneus and pre-cuneus. These decreases may have been due to inhibitory interconnections between neurons tuned to different spatial frequencies. These data indicate that tetanic sensory stimulation selectively targets and potentiates specific populations of neurons in the visual cortex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural Plasticity</field><field name="subject">LTP</field><field name="subject">Visual Cortex</field><field name="subject">Sensory Stimulation</field><field name="subject">Spatial Frequency</field><field name="subject">Orientation</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of UV-visible spectral imaging in forensic science</field><field name="creator">Wagner, John Harry</field><field name="description">This study investigated the use of UV-visible spectral imaging for the location and enhancement of substances of forensic interest using targeted approaches based on the spectrum of the substance. Spectral enhancement procedures were developed for blood with and without chemical enhancement, and for latent fingermarks after chemical enhancement. Focus was on substances whose spectrum exhibited a steep change in absorbance or fluorescence over a small wavelength range. Substances with such spectral features were able to be enhanced using arithmetic combinations of two or three spectral images taken at wavelengths near the steep spectral feature. Some enhancement reagents do not react to produce a product with a steep spectral feature suitable for photographic enhancement. In such cases reagents that compliment spectral imaging can be developed. A tridentate ligand for iron(II), BBIDMAPP, which forms a complex with a narrow intense charge-transfer band, was synthesised and was used to visualise muddy shoemarks. UV-visible spectral imaging systems based on a liquid crystal filter or a filter wheel were constructed to facilitate the acquisition of the spectral images and to perform the enhancement operations. A thorough characterisation of the imaging systems determined their limitations and sources of artefacts which could lead to complications in interpreting the enhanced images. The spectral imaging procedure used to visualise blood was incorporated into a near-real-time, hand-held imaging system for the location of blood staining. This prototype imaging system is capable of acquiring two spectral images simultaneously, perform the enhancement procedure, and display the enhanced image within 5 s, which would make it suitable as a non-chemical presumptive screening test for blood at crime scenes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic</field><field name="subject">Spectral imaging</field><field name="subject">Blood enhancement</field><field name="subject">fingermarks</field><field name="subject">shoemarks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the common-sense model of self-regulation to explore the factors associated with intentional non-adherence to preventer medication for asthma</field><field name="creator">Main, Jodie Jane</field><field name="description">Daily use of inhaled preventer medication is recommended for most people with asthma. However, research suggests many do not adhere to this regime. The current thesis comprises two research studies utilising the common-sense model of self-regulation as the theoretical basis to explore how people make decisions about inhaled preventer use in asthma. The purpose of Study One was to compare a self-report and an objective measure of adherence to preventer medication for asthma and to examine the illness representations and treatment beliefs associated with these measures. Accordingly, 1,936 U.K. General Practice patients who were using preventer medication for asthma completed a questionnaire assessing illness and medication perceptions and gave consent for information to be obtained from their medical records. Adherence to preventer medication was calculated from the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) and an objective measure, the proportion of prescribed medication that the participant collected over the previous year. Results show that nearly nine out of ten participants (88.4%) reported some non-adherence to their preventer medication. The most common form of non-adherence was using preventer inhaler only when feeling breathless. The relationships between participants&#8217; representations of their asthma and their beliefs about their preventer medication and adherence measures were tested using structural equation modelling. Seeing asthma as a condition that was not present when asymptomatic was associated with more non-adherence (&#946;=.22 p&lt;.001) and also with collecting a smaller proportion of prescribed preventer medication over the past year (&#946;=-.15, p&lt;.001). Seeing asthma as an acute condition, as a condition without serious consequences, and as a condition that could not be controlled by treatment were also representations associated with non-adherence. Those who did not see the need for preventer medication at all, or did not see the need for preventer medication when asymptomatic were more likely to be non-adherent. The relationship between illness representations and self-report adherence was mediated by the belief that medication was necessary. Having identified a number of key beliefs that were associated with use of preventer medication in asthma, Study Two explored the way in which these beliefs may be developed through the process of appraisal of the influence of medication use on symptom experience. Using quantitative methods, 77 patients from a New Zealand General Practice completed a questionnaire measuring the reasons for experimenting and stopping medication, illness representations and treatment beliefs. Thirty percent of the sample reported actively experimenting with their medication. These participants were more likely to hold the belief that medication did not help in the absence of symptoms (Mann-Whitney U=343.5, p&lt;.05) and to report trying to avoid thinking about asthma (Mann-Whitney U=330.5, p&lt;.05). Fifty-one of the participants were subsequently interviewed about their experiences with using medication and transcripts of these interviews were subjected to a qualitative analysis. Participants&#8217; responses suggested that the process of appraising whether medication is necessary was influenced by the match between what the participant expects to happen when using the medication and what actually does happen. The process of deciding when medication is necessary is influenced by the threshold at which medication is deemed to be necessary and the speed at which symptoms return if medication is stopped. These findings have implications for the development of interventions to improve adherence to preventer medication for asthma. They suggest that a key component of self-management education is educating patients about the nature of asthma as a chronic condition that is present even in the absence of symptoms. Additionally, they provide evidence that many patients are involved in an active process of appraising the success of their medication. Health professionals should be aware of that this process is likely to be influenced by patients&#8217; expectations of medication, the level of symptoms at which they believe action is required to control asthma and the speed at which symptoms return if medication is discontinued. Future research could take the form of a randomised controlled intervention to assess whether discussion of these factors with patients could improve quality of life for people with asthma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Adherence</field><field name="subject">Health Psychology</field><field name="subject">Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the cultural diplomacy of Canada, New Zealand and India</field><field name="creator">Mark, Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept and practice of cultural diplomacy. Cultural diplomacy is carried out by a government to support its foreign policy goals or diplomacy (or both) by using a wide range of cultural manifestations for a variety of purposes. The thesis examines aspects of the cultural diplomacy of Canada, Qu&#233;bec, New Zealand and India in order to investigate how cultural diplomacy presents a national image abroad (potentially as part of a national brand); its role in the protection of cultural sovereignty; and how it advances domestic objectives. The thesis argues that cultural diplomacy, in presenting a national image abroad, frequently emphasises a state&#8217;s modern-ness or its cultural distinctiveness. This raises the question of the link between national image and national brand and highlights the limitations inherent in national branding. For some states, cultural diplomacy plays a role in the protection of cultural sovereignty. Canadian cultural diplomacy supports the international activities of domestic cultural industries and has sought to maintain the right to provide this support within the multilateral free trade framework. Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s cultural diplomacy has sought to protect the province&#8217;s cultural sovereignty from a perceived threat from the Canadian federation. Cultural diplomacy helps advance domestic objectives. The cultural diplomacy of Canada has asserted the right of the federal government to be Canada&#8217;s only diplomatic voice, and to counter Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s claims to sovereignty. Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s cultural diplomacy has asserted the province&#8217;s constitutional rights and distinctiveness within the Canadian federation. In a similar way, the international exhibition Te Maori advanced the interests of Maori in New Zealand. Cultural diplomacy&#8217;s domestic impacts include positive international recognition for a state&#8217;s culture, which contributes to a state&#8217;s sense of being a distinctive national community and to its confidence, economic prosperity and nation-building. The thesis concludes that cultural diplomacy remains a valuable tool of diplomacy and is likely to become more important to governments, particularly to their public diplomacy and as a contributor to soft power, because of cultural diplomacy&#8217;s promulgation of a distinctive national identity, the increasing importance of a cultural aspect in economic interests, and the intrinsic appeal of culture to globalised populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360102 Comparative government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restraint of trade at common law</field><field name="creator">Dempster, Hamish Leslie</field><field name="description">This is a collection of essays about the restraint of trade doctrine as laid down in the courts of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth. Generally, I will not give an account of the restraint of trade doctrine in the United States of America, for even although each individual state (apart from the civil jurisdictions California and Louisiana) and the federation itself, has a common law system, for reasons peculiar to those jurisdictions, the restraint of trade case law there has become so vast and so confused as to be unsuitable for my purposes. More importantly, however, the common law restraint of trade doctrine in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth has been laid down by courts without any significant consideration of the state of the law in the United States. Davies v Davies (1887) 36 Ch D 359, 370 by contrast, the period during which the Privy Council operated as a supra national court of final appeal has resulted in considerable harmony in the doctrine within the British Commonwealth. Even now the House of Lords is influential in Australia and Canada and the influence is increasingly reciprocal. By way of an exception I will discuss the purposes of the anti-trust legislation in the United States. This is necessary because I intend to show that the common law restraint of trade doctrine was not able to be, and was never intended to be, a means of regulating the economy in contradistinction to the United States anti-trust legislation and related legislation in the British Commonwealth. This account is not merely a description of the law relating to the restraint of trade doctrine although I do purport to describe the law. There are other accounts of the restraint of trade doctrine which do that well. Accounts of the restraint of trade doctrine include: Matthews &amp; Adler, The Law Relating to Covenants in Restraints of Trade (London, 2nd ed 1907); Sanderson, Restraint of Trade in English law (London, 1926); Heydon, The Restraint of Trade Doctrine (London, 1971); Trebilcock, The Common Law of Restraint of Trade; A Legal and Economic Analysis (Toronto, 1986); Dean, The Law of Trade Secrets (Sydney, 1990); Mehigan &amp; Griffiths, Restraint of Trade and Business Secrets: Law &amp; Practice (London, 2nd ed 1991); Holdsworth, History of English Law IV (3rd ed, 1945) 343-54, 373-9; VIII (2nd ed, 1937) 56-42. There are other, less detailed accounts in contract law textbooks. The purpose of this dissertation is to describe aspects of the doctrine as it developed between the medieval period and the twentieth century and then to use that account as a basis for an analysis of how the law has taken a number of paths during the twentieth century which cannot be justified by the rules and their justifications which existed in the law prior to that time. Such a development has had important consequences for the restraint of trade doctrine and even the law in general, most of which have been detrimental. I do not intend to give a continuous historical narrative covering the whole of the doctrine. The history has been described before. For example, I do not intend to give a discrete account of the process by which the absolute rule against general restraints of trade gave way to the rule of reason, although I do mention this process where relevant for other purposes. The history, so far as it is relevant, is integrated into each chapter. I will argue that historically the restraint of trade doctrine was a rule or complex of rules, of a certain form and content. The form and content of the rule are important because they bear on the meaning of the class term "restraint of trade" which is an element of the rule. The meaning of that term began to change around the year 1890. Beginning first with certain classes of trade combination, courts began to classify as restraints of trade covenants which did not in fact restrain trade. Then the courts similarly treated the exclusive dealing contract and certain forms of property transaction. Another trend in the law which added to the confusion about the meaning of restraint of trade was the failure by the courts to make definitive findings one way or another as to whether a particular covenant was in restraint of trade. The courts were then faced with a dilemma. The law required a court to refuse to enforce a covenant in restraint of trade unless the covenantee could justify the restraint by presenting evidence to the court from which the courts could assess whether or not that particular restraint was within the reason for the restraint of trade doctrine or not. Such considerations were entirely inapt in the case of covenants which, in accordance with the traditional view, did not restrain trade. Yet if the courts did not validate these contracts, catastrophic consequences would have followed for the parties to such contracts and, indeed, to contract as an institution. To solve the dilemma the courts began to interpret the famous statement of the restraint of trade doctrine by Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns &amp; Ammunition Co [1894] AC 535, 565 (HL) literally, rather than contextually. Ultimately this has resulted in the obscuring of the rule underlying the restraint of trade doctrine itself. There were many minor confusions along the way. It is important that the doctrine is coherent and its use consistent with its justifications because it is still a fruitful cause of legal change. In the last year the force of the rule has caused a radical restructuring of Association Football in Europe Bosman&#8217;s case. The rule has even penetrated the collective consciousness of the community at large. The broad thrust of the development and the detail will be outlined in the next thirteen chapters.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade unions and the common law in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Rodney</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine and evaluate the present common law relating to trade unions in New Zealand.

These developments have occurred as a result of questions which have been raised, on both sides of the Atlantic, about the role of the juvenile court in combating delinquency. In the United States the resulting re-appraisal of the court&#8217;s function has been characterised by an emphasis on the fact that the court is part of the criminal justice system, and that it therefore cannot ignore the need to protect society against harmful conduct and to observe the requirements of due process. In England and Scotland, on the other hand, the movement has been towards the creation of tribunals which pay less attention to the child&#8217;s offence and which exercise a jurisdiction which tends to blur the distinction between offenders and non-offenders. From an analysis of this contrast the thesis moves to an examination of a significant similarity between the emerging Anglo- American systems. Although different solutions have been adopted to the problem of re-defining the role of the Juvenile court, the reforms in each of the countries studies have been accompanied by a desire to narrow the jurisdiction of the court. The conclusion which emerges from an examination of British and American experience is that, instead of seeing the juvenile court as an all-purpose delinquency-control agency, it should be viewed as an agency whose inherent limitations must be recognised if best use is to be made of its distinctive capabilities. This conclusion raises four related problems which the thesis considers in detail. First, attention is given to the task of attempting to define the court&#8217;s role, and an effort is made to determine which functions it can effectively and appropriately perform. Second, on the basis of this analysis, consideration is given to the formulation of criteria which indicate with precision the types of case which should be referred to court. Third, the design of an effective sieving device is discussed: machinery must be created which will ensure that the court receives only those cases which are appropriate to its re-defined role. Fourth, reference is made to the types of informal services which are required to deal with the cases diverted from the court. Against this comparative and theoretical background aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s system for dealing with young offenders are considered. This part of the study takes the form of an historical analysis of its development and a description of the system in operation. Because of the conclusion reached regarding the importance of limiting court intake particular attention is focused on the procedures and criteria employed in making the decision as to whether or not a child should be prosecuted. Hence the fieldwork on which much of the New Zealand material is based concentrates on the Youth Aid/Social Welfare conference. An attempt is made to describe and analyse the day-to-day working of this type of sieving device. The findings are discussed, and certain features of the conference system are criticised. The thesis concludes with comments on some of the difficulties which must be taken into account in implementing a policy which emphasises the informal handling of young offenders.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of the common law defences of fair comment and qualified privilege to a defamation action with particular reference to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tobin, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rogernomics and the Treaty of Waitangi: the contradiction between the economic and Treaty policies of the fourth Labour government, 1984-1990, and the role of law in mediating that contradiction in the interests of the colonial capitalist state</field><field name="creator">Kelsey, Jane</field><field name="description">During the 1970s and early 1980s the historic contradiction between Maori and the colonial state publicly resurfaced, with high-profile Maori demands for the recognition of Maori sovereignty. By 1984 those demands became broader-based. They focused on the Crown's affirmation in the Treaty of Waitangi of continued Maori control over economic resources, independent political authority, and the protection of the Maori way of life. In the face of these pressures, the Labour Party, and later the fourth Labour Government, committed itself to a policy of recognising the Treaty of Waitangi. At the same time, New Zealand's under-developed capitalist economy was in crisis. Advocates of market liberalism within the Fourth Labour Government secured a power base from which they launched the New Zealand version of their paradigm, known as Rogernomics. The two policies were logically irreconcilable, and embodied the deeper, real contradiction of the colonial project itself. Once that logical contradiction became apparent, and the electoral implications became too costly, the Treaty policy gave way. The primary focus of this thesis is the role played by colonial law, legal ideology, and the legal intellectuals in mediating those contradictions during the 1980s. They helped to secure a passive revolution, whereby Maori demands were defused, and Maori resistance was subsumed within the political and judicial forums of the colonial state. This development is analysed within the framework of the dual state, whereby metropolitan and colonial social formations co-exist within the one national boundary, both dominated by the capitalist mode of production. In this thesis, that duality comprises Pakeha within New Zealand, and Maori within Aotearoa. The specifically legal dynamics are situated within the complex interactions of the economic, political, juridical, and ideological levels of that dual state during the 1980s. The thesis concludes that the colonial state did secure a passive revolution over Maori between 1984 and 1990. But this was, at best, a temporary reprieve. By the end of the Fourth Labour Government, in October 1990, many Maori remained committed to the anti-colonial struggle. It appeared that the fundamental contradictions of colonial capitalism, and the crisis of constitutional legitimacy for the colonial state, had not been resolved. They had merely been deferred.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law::390110 Indigenous laws</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditionalizing sustainable development: the law, policy and practice in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kwa, Eric L. (Eric Lokai)</field><field name="description">In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development published its long awaited report: "Our Common Future". The report contained a detailed discussion of global environment and development problems and a set of recommendations which the Commission suggested could alleviate many of those problems. At the core of the Commission's recommendation was the 'sustainable development' concept which the Commission strongly suggested countries should adopt as the principal vehicle for overcoming many of the global environmental and social ills. But, what is sustainable development? What are its core values? How can sustainable development be utilized to arrest and resolve global societal problems? Does sustainable development have a universal application? Under what conditions can sustainable development be successfully implemented? These are some of the key issues that are addressed in this research paper. In this paper I look at the origin and definition of the sustainable development concept and identify the relevant principles of the concept. I also identify the tools that are necessary for the implementation of the concept. The underpinning of my argument is that sustainable development can be successfully implemented by countries particularly developing countries because the concept has strong roots in traditional cultures which are dominant in developing countries. I explore this position and the various issues that have been identified above by adopting Papua New Guinea (PNG) a developing country as a case study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into the necessity for the harm requirement in criminal offences: an existential study</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Elisabeth Helena</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vessel source pollution and key international conventions: a case for change</field><field name="creator">Gray, J.A. (John Andrew)</field><field name="description">Pollution from vessels cannot be controlled effectively without the involvement of flag States. They have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the vessels which fly their flags comply with all applicable international rules and standards relating to vessel source pollution. Compliance with such rules and standards involves additional operating costs for ship-owners. Thus, in the highly competitive international maritime transport industry, there are many incentives for flag States not to prejudice their pursuit of comparative advantage by ensuring that their flag vessels comply with the applicable rules and standards. Enforcing their flag vessels to comply is not a rational choice. Accordingly, flag States must be given reasons to ensure that their flag vessels do comply with pollution control rules and standards if the problem of vessel source pollution is to be resolved. Neither of the two international Conventions which regulate the control of vessel source pollution, namely MARPOL and UNCLOS III, gives flag States reasons to ensure the compliant operation of their flag vessels. For that reason, neither Convention can claim to be an effective means for controlling pollution from vessels. There is, however, emerging evidence of flag State commitment to the control of vessel source pollution in response to the application of regional Port State Control measures. From the perspective of flag States, one aspect of the application of the concept of Port State Control is of concern - that is the legal basis of the control measures which are being taken against their flag vessels for violations of MARPOL's rules and standards.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a microarray for potyvirus detection and identification</field><field name="creator">Wei, Ting, 1968-</field><field name="description">Potyvirus is the largest and one of the most economically important of the virus genera infecting plants. The complexities of potyvirus identification resulting from many different species, mixed infections, emerging new viruses, new hosts, and new vectors, etc., often requires the use of multiple detection methods which is time consumable and costly. Therefore an assay that can test for a range of potyviruses simultaneously, with good specificity and sensitivity, is desirable. This study looked at the feasibility of producing an oligonucleotide microarray for detection and identification of potyviruses at both species and strain level. Thirty plant samples with suspected potyvirus infections were collected from field and research laboratories in New Zealand and partial NIb gene, complete CP gene and 3&#900;UTR were sequenced. Twelve definitive potyviruses, one tentative potyvirus, one non-potyvirus, and one novel potyviruslike sequence were identified, six of which were first records for New Zealand. Sequence analysis showed that NIb and CP genes and the 3&#900;UTR contained both conserved and variable sequences which were used to design both species and strain level specific probes. Four Potyvirus species were chosen for a &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; study and probes were designed using two different software programs (ROSO and CAG software). A total of eighty five probes including 33 perfect-match and 52 mismatch probes were selected to represent the four targeted potyviruses. Each probe was synthesized with spacers of either 6 or 12 poly-cytosine or poly-thymine at the 5&#900; terminus. Arrays showed high specificity to the targets when tested using nineteen different geographically diverse potyvirus isolates representing the four target species, four distinct but closely related New Zealand potyviruses, and four healthy plant species. Factors affecting the hybridization efficiency, e.g. the size of the target fragments, secondary structure of probes and targets, label type, strandedness, Tm and GC content of probes, were also investigated. The approaches and protocols developed in this study should form a useful basis for developing other potyviruses arrays and the results also provide useful insights into issues of generic interest for the development of arrays for detecting other pathogens.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cyclical perspective of the common law</field><field name="creator">Cadenhead, John.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to use synthesis and analysis in respect of certain models of tort obligation to show that the common law has evolved and been shaped by recurring cycles. It was not possible to analyse the entirety of the wide sweep of tort obligation, so the models of trespass, trespass on the case, deceit and special relationship negligence were synthesised and then historically compared. From these models distinct recurring cycles of the common law became apparent, which alternated between expansionary and conservative stages. At one time the common law seeks a vehicle for new flexible remedies and obligations, and at another, it seeks the certainty of fixed rules. The cycle is incessant as for every swing in one direction, at a certain point on the pendulum, there will be a reaction. This thesis explores the pathology of those cycles through such selected models, including the symptoms exhibited by the initial ad hoc characteristics of the birth of a remedy or obligation, the maturing phase of a remedy or obligation created by the emergence of categories of liability, the abstraction from such categories of a general principle, and either the over-extension of such general principle, or the narrowing of such general principle leading to the obligation's ultimate demise as a flexible vehicle of liability. In the event of the death of an obligation or remedy, as a flexible vehicle of liability, the common law will seek to find or create another avenue of flexible remedy. The thesis does not seek to investigate the reasons or causes of such cycles, but is content to examine the symptoms exhibited by the various phases of such cycles. The initial two chapters summarise the general theory of such cyclic perspective and briefly outline the template of such cycles created by the early origins of the common law. The cycles of 'trespass' and 'deceit' show the rise and fall of those respective obligations from flexible remedies to narrow moribund obligations. The concepts upon which they were based of contra pacem and honesty were to prove excessively narrow and restrictive to survive the inevitable attrition caused through the natural accumulation of rules. A study of the cycle of these two obligations is rewarding as they both show a complete lifespan of an obligation through the various phases of a cycle up to the point of its death as an instrument of flexibility. The protean action on the case and the modern pragmatic case-by-case negligence formula, based on the open-ended elements of &#8216;foresight', 'proximity' and 'just and reasonableness', illustrate the problems caused by a remedy or obligation whose conceptualisation is vague and uncertain. The common law itself until 1875, apart from equity, had the ability through the action on the case to provide the common law with flexibility when needed. The closest that the common law in modern times has come to emulating the action on the case has been the remedial use of the negligence mechanism. While the action on the case did not survive the procedural reforms of the 19th century, it had developed general rules that limited the scope of such open-ended action. These general over-arching rules are important to a study of modern negligence liability. This thesis will endeavour to show that the modern open-ended negligence formula should be limited by comparable general rules to resist the inevitable pressure upon it to define its fault component or duty mechanism too narrowly. Synthesis by use of the tool of comparative legal history shows the constant tension in the common law between the quest for certainty through rules, on the one hand, and the ability to administer individual justice, despite the presence of a general rule, on the other. A comparison of the life cycles of the models selected shows a certain symmetry concerning the reasons and justifications advanced in constructing liability in either an expansionary or conservative phase of the common law. A cyclic perspective of the common law treats it as a dynamic constantly moving instrument that reflects the policy moods of contemporary society. Such a view of the law is not one-dimensional and may provide answers as to the past and present evolution of the common law and may give clues as to its future direction.

The combined pressures of endemic social needs and international demands for tighter drug control measures inevitably raise questions as to whether certain criminogenic effects were produced by this legislative activity. They include: Did premature restrictions cause amplification of the range of substances that became the subjects of abuse? Do the restraints that are now imposed have a scope and severity disproportionate to the social harm threatened by the proscribed conduct? These questions cannot be conclusively answered in a study of this nature, but the historical approach illustrates the complex relationship, both on a domestic and an international scale, between legislative action and conduct which is deemed criminal. An attempt is made to evaluate the assistance available to New Zealand courts from overseas judicial interpretations of legislation enacted within the same context of international obligation. As is then demonstrated, the major drug offences provide fertile ground for nurturing the technical requirements of proof of guilt. Already in New Zealand, in response to the demands and resources of accused persons faced with high penalties upon conviction, the concept of possession has been judicially analysed in great depth and detail. A comparative study is made of the requirements of the corresponding possessory offences in some other jurisdictions; each of the major offences against the Act is then analysed by analogy with the elements of possession. The statutory defences are also examined in relation to this analysis. Although an appraisal of the morality of current legislative policy is not seen as being within the scope of this study, an attempt is made to gauge the effect of Parliament's extension of police powers of search and seizure, and of the power to use listening devices, on the ways by which the courts have weighed socially important contending interests in the most delicate of balances. The courts' evident acceptance of the need for 'undercover' police detective operations in relation to drug offences is documented, as are the judicial restraints applied to the use of evidence so obtained. Sentencing policy in this context is a subject of increasing public interest and concern. An analysis is made of the principles of sentencing as they emerge from New Zealand Court of Appeal judgments over the period 1970-1979. It will be shown that aspects of that policy received recognition in the 1975 Act. However, because of the apparent emphasis on deterrence, many problems continue to tax the sentencing tribunal. This study does not purport to be exhaustive. It excludes detailed consideration of the administrative provisions in the Act and eschews analysis of offences against sections 11, 15 and 16 (concerning theft, etc., of controlled drugs, false statements, and obstruction of officers). The discussions of liability for secondary participation, and the inchoate offences, are confined to such points as are seen to be directly related to the context of drug offences. With some exceptions where subsequent information has come to hand, the law is stated on the basis of the materials available to the writer on 1 May 1980.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Constitution of Fiji</field><field name="creator">Sahu Khan, Muhammad Shamsud-Dean</field><field name="description">The Constitution of Fiji though similar to many others adopted within the Commonwealth since the end of the Second World War departs in many respects from the Constitution of the United Kingdom and that of New Zealand. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is wholly unwritten and that of New Zealand is only partly written as contained in the Constitution Act of 1852. Fiji not only has a written Constitution; the Constitution also incorporates the rules or principles which are accepted as constitutional conventions in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In this thesis attention has been given to the position of the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen and the powers conferred upon him. The fact that he is a local appointee makes his position even more delicate. The problem is accentuated in that the exercise of some of his powers are made nonjusticiable by the Constitution. It is also suggested in this work that the fact that the Constitution of Fiji has an entirely different basis from that of the United Kingdom or New Zealand renders many of the principles adopted in those countries inapplicable. The notion of parliamentary sovereignty propounded by Dicey and others does not apply. The Constitution, not Parliament, is supreme. Judicial review of legislation is inevitable and the courts are intended as guardians of the Constitution. There are other important differences many of which are the result of the political decisions made on behalf of the three main races in Fiji before the Constitution was drafted. The separate Fijian administration and the powers of the Council of Chiefs are illustrations of these provisions. The fact the indigenous Fijians enjoy a privileged position through the separate Fijian Administration and the Council of Chiefs is discussed. The system of representation in the House of Representatives with a combination of the communal and multiracial electorates provides an unusual, perhaps questionable, experiment towards a solution of the tensions and problems associated with a heterogeneous society. Likewise the fundamental rights provisions have special significance in a multi-racial society like that of Fiji. As a background to the above matters a comprehensive survey of the constitutional history of the country is attempted. The role of the judiciary has been given significant emphasis throughout the thesis as it is felt that the judiciary is linchpin of the Constitution of Fiji. Concluding observations have been offered on ways of making the spirit of the Constitution, as enshrined in the preamble to the Constitution, a reality; and to engender a national outlook amongst the people of all ethnic groups.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding linear algebra concepts through the embodied, symbolic and formal worlds of mathematical thinking</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Sepideh</field><field name="description">Linear algebra is one of the first advanced mathematics courses that students encounter at university level. The transfer from a primarily procedural or algorithmic school approach to an abstract and formal presentation of concepts through concrete definitions, seems to be creating difficulty for many students who are barely coping with procedural aspects of the subject. This research proposes applying APOS theory, in conjunction with Tall&#8217;s three worlds of embodied, symbolic and formal mathematics, to create a framework in order to examine the learning of a variety of linear algebra concepts by groups of first and second year university students. The aim is to investigate the difficulties in understanding some linear algebra concepts and to propose potential paths for preventing them. As part of this research project several case studies were conducted where groups of first and second year students were exposed to teaching and learning some introductory linear algebra concepts based on the framework and expressed their thinking through their involvements in tests, interviews and concept maps. The results suggest that the students had limited understanding of the concepts, they struggled to recognise the concepts in different registers, and their lack of ability in linking the major concepts became apparent. However, they also revealed that those with more representational diversity had more overall understanding of the concepts. In particular the embodied introduction of the concept proved a valuable adjunct to their thinking. Since difficulties with learning linear algebra by average students are universally acknowledged, it is anticipated that this study may provide suggestions with the potential for widespread positive consequences for learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basic equality and its applications</field><field name="creator">Smith, Nicholas Mark</field><field name="description">Equality is a prominent value in modern moral, legal and political philosophy. There is, however, much controversy over the meaning of the concept and its moral implications. In this thesis I argue that the recent scepticism expressed by some writers about the prospects of reaching any agreement about what equality means is not well founded. The idea is not an empty one. The difficulty in pinning down its exact meaning and implications for our social ethics is caused by its abstractness, not its vacuity. The moral significance of equality can be expressed in the idea of basic equality &#8211; the requirement that persons are to be treated as equals and accorded equal concern and respect. That idea is morally justifiable and plays an important role in modern moral theory. If we accept that human beings are equal in important respects and that a commitment to basic equality as a moral ideal makes sense because of our shared human condition, then it follows that respect for that value is implicit in each instance of our moral decision making. The abstractness of basic equality means that it cannot serve as a straightforward rule which can be easily applied to disputes about who should or should not receive equal treatment. There is no list of prohibited grounds of differentiation that applies in all circumstances. Thoughtful moral judgments about the denial of basic equality typically demand sophisticated assessments of whether the interests of all affected parties have been taken into account and different sorts of denial of basic equality will require consideration of different factors. Attempts have been made in recent equality law jurisprudence to find a less abstract concept of equality that can inform the interpretation of the law. These are unsuccessful because basic equality cannot be reduced to some simpler, rule like, standard. These understandable attempts to make this area of law more manageable are not good explanations of what is morally important about the idea of equality. Clarity about the meaning and purpose of contemporary discrimination law is not likely to be achieved by further attempts to say what this law is really about. The law is difficult to apply because it is in the same broad terms as the idea of basic equality. The central moral quandaries of recent jurisprudential thought about basic equality concern the appropriateness of different treatment on grounds which can be used to discriminate against people. The difficulties that courts have with these issues are not remarkable because the moral issues are intractable. Issues such as indirect discrimination or the fairness of affirmative action policies require in depth consideration of the interests and concerns of all affected parties and will not be resolved by the application of any simple algorithm based on a less abstract definition of equality. These issues are difficult to resolve, not because we do not know what equality is but because weighing the competing concerns of affected parties while paying attention to other important values is a complex and often difficult task.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the Dicke model: from phase space approach to quantum trajectories</field><field name="creator">de Oliveira, Felipe Dimer</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study the Dicke model outside the rotating wave approximation (RWA), by employing phase space techniques and the quantum trajectory theory.

Monolingual participants, matched for age and handedness, were recruited as controls. The Stroop colour-word task was considered an appropriate tool to test the general hypothesis that bilingualism might influence executive or cognitive control processes. In Study One, a dual-task paradigm was used for assessing the lateralisation of language functions (given the linguistic nature of the Stroop paradigm used here) in the bilinguals (Macedonian-English/M-E). Bilinguals showed a more bilateral hemispheric involvement, for both languages, compared to monolinguals. These findings also provided supporting evidence for the hypothesis of greater right-hemispheric involvement for language in bilinguals. In Study Two, two behavioural Stroop task paradigms (manual and verbal) were used in order to assess the magnitude of the Stroop effect between the groups. Bilinguals (M-E, German-English/G-E) showed a trend of smaller interference scores across both languages compared to monolinguals. In Study Three, manual Stroop task performance with concurrent electroencephalograph (EEG) recording revealed that bilinguals had temporal shifts in the N400 component (of about 30-40 ms) for the interference comparison for both languages compared to monolinguals. Also, relative to monolinguals, M-E bilinguals (for both L1 and L2) and G-E bilinguals (for L2) had fewer electrodes over frontal and central sites with a significant amplitude difference in the interference comparison (i.e., a reduced interference effect). In Study Four, the neural substrates engaged during Stroop task performance were investigated using fMRI. In general, monolinguals showed greater activation in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate (regions associated with good executive control). This suggested that relative to bilinguals, monolinguals require more neural resources to accomplish conflict resolution. Taken together, Stroop task performance in late and proficient bilinguals currently living in the L2 environment differed from that of monolinguals across all methods of investigation. It appears that cognitive processing changes at the executive level can be observed as a result of bilingualism. The results also provide some evidence for changes in L1 processing following late L2 acquisition, as similar results across both languages and tasks were observed for the M-E bilinguals. It is also possible that slight modifications to cerebral laterality as a result of the late learning of (and continuous exposure to) a second language could contribute to these differences in executive functioning. The language environment might therefore be a major factor in the lateralisation of language processing and executive functioning in bilinguals. These conclusions, though tentative and require further investigation, have important implications for language and executive processing in general and for theories regarding cognitive flexibility in bilinguals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Stroop</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">interference</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">behavioural</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">executive</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380102 Learning, memory, cognition and language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital surface curvature</field><field name="creator">Rugis, John</field><field name="description">The theoretical basis for this thesis can be found in the subject of differential geometry where both line and surface curvature is a core feature. We begin with a review of curvature basics, establish notational conventions, and contribute new results (on n-cuts) which are of importance for this thesis. A new scale invariant curvature measure is presented. Even though curvature of continuous smooth lines and surfaces is a well-defined property, when working with digital surfaces, curvature can only be estimated. We review the nature of digitized surfaces and present a number of curvature estimators, one of which (the 3-cut mean estimator) is new. We also develop an estimator for our new scale invariant curvature measure, and apply it to digital surfaces. Surface curvature maps are defined and examples are presented. A number of curvature visualization examples are provided. In practical applications, the noise present in digital surfaces usually precludes the possibility of direct curvature calculation. We address this noise problem with solutions including a new 2.5D filter. Combining techniques, we introduce a data processing pipeline designed to generate surface registration markers which can be used to identify correspondences between multiple surfaces. We present a method (projecting curvature maps) in which high resolution detail is merged with a simplified mesh model for visualization purposes. Finally, we present the results of experiments (using texture projection merging and image processing assisted physical measurement) in which we have identified, characterized, and produced visualizations of selected fine surface detail from a digitization of Michelangelo&#8217;s David statue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of periconceptional undernutrition and twinning on ovine pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Rumball, Christopher William Henry</field><field name="description">Events around conception such as maternal undernutrition and twinning may have effects on offspring physiology and disease risk in adulthood.  Periconceptional undernutrition alters offspring physiology and adult pathology without affecting birth size, while twinning affects birth size and physiology but with inconsistent effects on adult pathology.  We investigated the effects of these two periconceptional events and their interaction on maternal cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy and fetal growth, physiology and endocrinology in late gestation in sheep.  Pre and/or postconception undernutrition resulted in increased uterine blood flow in late gestation, but no change in maternal blood volume.  Preconception undernutrition alone resulted in a relatively large placenta with a small, slow-growing fetus in late gestation.  In contrast, postconception undernutrition alone resulted in a fetus with rapid late-gestation growth that was maintained through a maternal fast.  Fetuses of ewes undernourished throughout both periods were similar in growth rate and size to controls.  Maternal fasting also demonstrated that plasma levels of C-type natriuretic peptide are acutely and independently regulated by nutrient supply in mother and fetus. Fetuses of ewes undernourished both pre- and postconception had increased glucose disposal following a glucose challenge.  Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis tests in these fetuses showed decreased pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone response to direct stimulation but increased adrenal response to decreased cortisol negative feedback. Twin fetuses grew more slowly in late gestation than singletons. Twins also had a smaller insulin response to arginine and a greater insulin response to glucose, but periconceptional undernutrition abolished this difference.  Twins had suppressed baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and decreased adrenal sensitivity compared to singletons, but increased fetal pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone response to direct stimulation and decreased cortisol negative feedback. These studies suggest that firstly, fetal size is a poor reflection of fetal growth trajectory, physiology and endocrinology.  Secondly, pre- and postconception undernutrition affect late-gestation fetal growth in different ways, while undernutrition in both periods alters fetal endocrine status in late gestation.  Thirdly, the biology of twin fetal development is fundamentally different from that of singletons, which may explain the inconsistency of the relationship between birth weight and adult disease risk in twins.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">developmental origins of health and disease</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">fetal programming</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</field><field name="subject">glucose-insulin axis</field><field name="subject">fetal growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270603 Animal physiology-systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321206 Preventative medicine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of software obfuscations</field><field name="creator">Majumdar, Anirban</field><field name="description">Software obfuscation is a protection technique for making code unintelligible to automated program comprehension and analysis tools. It works by performing semantic preserving transformations such that the difficulty of automatically extracting the computational logic out of code is increased. Obfuscating transforms in existing literature have been designed with the ambitious goal of being resilient against all possible reverse engineering attacks. Even though some of the constructions are based on intractable computational problems, we do not know, in practice, how to generate hard instances of obfuscated problems such that all forms of program analyses would fail. In this thesis, we address the problem of software protection by developing a weaker notion of obfuscation under which it is not required to guarantee an absolute blackbox security. Using this notion, we develop provably-correct obfuscating transforms using dependencies existing within program structures and indeterminacies in communication characteristics between programs in a distributed computing environment. We  show how several well known static analysis tools can be used for reverse engineering obfuscating transforms that derive resilience from computationally hard problems. In particular, we restrict ourselves to one common and potent static analysis tool, the static slicer, and use it as our attack tool. We show the use of derived software engineering metrics to indicate the degree of success or failure of a slicer attack on a piece of obfuscated code. We address the issue of proving correctness of obfuscating transforms by adapting existing proof techniques for functional program refinement and communicating sequential processes. The results of this thesis could be used for future work in two ways: first, future researchers may extend our proposed techniques to design obfuscations using a wider range of dependencies that exist between dynamic program structures. Our restricted attack model using one static analysis tool can also be relaxed and obfuscations capable of withstanding a broader class of static and dynamic analysis attacks could be developed based on the same principles. Secondly, our obfuscatory strength evaluation techniques could guide anti-malware researchers in the development of tools to detect obfuscated strains of polymorphic viruses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obfuscation</field><field name="subject">software security</field><field name="subject">program transformation</field><field name="subject">global state monitoring</field><field name="subject">slicing</field><field name="subject">distributed computing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Being aged' in the Everyday: uncovering the meaning through elders' stories</field><field name="creator">Wright-St Clair, Valerie A</field><field name="description">It&#8217;s like the sun and the tide. The aim of this study was to understand the meaning of &#8216;being aged&#8217; through the everyday experiences of those who are aged. Philosophically, this interpretive study was informed by hermeneutics and interpretive phenomenology. The writings of two twentieth-century philosophers, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger, guided the study&#8217;s design and research methods. The phenomenon of interest is &#8216;being aged;&#8217; a thing which is ordinarily taken-for-granted in the everyday. However, much is already spoken and empirically &#8216;known&#8217; about the phenomenon by those who are not yet aged. Methodologically the study&#8217;s design sought to &#8216;put aside&#8217; those voices and listen in closely to what elders themselves had to say about being in their everyday lives. Individual research conversations were conducted with fifteen participants; four Maori elders aged 71 to 93 and eleven non-Maori elders aged 80 to 97 years. All were living in private residences on Auckland&#8217;s North Shore and recruited by way of the general electoral roll. The conversations were focused on gathering the stories of particular everyday events as well as the person&#8217;s reflections on aging. Anecdotes drawn from the conversations formed the research text. Hermeneutics informed the interpretive engagement with this text. As a non-Maori researcher, cultural integrity of the text and the interpretations was enhanced through partnership with a Maori advisor. Dwelling hermeneutically with the anecdotal text was a way of listening to the spoken and unspoken words. Four overarching notions were illuminated and form the study&#8217;s findings. They are my interpretive descriptions of the ordinary ways of &#8216;being in the everyday,&#8217; the experiences of &#8216;being with others&#8217; in advanced age, the announcing of being aged in the uncomfortableness of &#8216;experiencing the unaccustomed&#8217; and how &#8216;aging just is&#8217; there in an everyday way. Reflecting phenomenologically on the findings, the meaning of being aged is in its ordinariness. My thesis is that being in the ordinary everyday in advanced age both conceals and reveals the phenomenon of being aged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">everyday</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">elders</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321007 Geriatrics and gerontology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging reluctant writers: the nature of reluctance to write and the effect of a self-regulation strategy training programme on the engagement and writing performance of reluctant writers in secondary school English</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Shaun</field><field name="description">The studies reported in this thesis examine the way engagement and motivational theories provide insight and understanding into how to engage, more effectively, reluctant writers at the secondary school level. Models of &#8216;writing engagement&#8217; and &#8216;reluctance to write&#8217; are proposed which represent a synthesis of findings from literature reviews and from a series of four studies employing a range of quantitative and qualitative methods. Study One investigated the beliefs of experienced teachers of English about the nature of reluctance to write. The teachers were interviewed separately and asked to describe the characteristics of reluctant writers that they had taught displayed. The teachers identified the behaviours and beliefs that they believed these students exhibited and described what they tried to do to improve student engagement with writing. Study Two developed a tool to measure different levels of engagement with writing. A questionnaire was piloted with 99 Year 10 students from four different secondary schools and then further tested and refined with 265 Year 10 students from two secondary schools. The final version of the resulting instrument was later used in the final phase of this project as a means of measuring improvements in reported engagement levels as the result of an intervention. Study Three explored student beliefs about what hindered or aided their engagement with writing in the English classroom. Four focus groups were conducted involving 28 students from the two schools that had participated in the questionnaire study. The focus groups were divided into two types: engaged and reluctant writers. Results from the focus group study clarified the differences and similarities between the two groups of writers and helped to refine understanding of what was important in engaging writers with school based writing. The results suggest that interest in a topic and the perceived relevance of the task to the student are the main factors influencing engagement. Other findings suggest that reluctant writers are more likely to be influenced by teacher, self-belief and knowledge and skill factors than engaged writers who are more likely to want choice and control over their writing. Some gender differences also appeared. In particular, girls appeared to be more aware of the influence of self-belief factors on engagement, and reluctant girls appeared to be particularly influenced by teacher factors. Finally, Study Four was an intervention study exploring the impact a self-regulation strategy development treatment had on the engagement and writing performance of Year 10 students. Students&#8217; ability to self-regulate during the writing process had been identified in each of the previous studies, and in prior research, as an important factor affecting writing engagement and achievement scores. This study specifically sought to measure if the intervention had a differing impact on reluctant versus non-reluctant students. Four treatment groups completed the writing engagement questionnaire before and after the intervention period. Pre and post samples of writing performance were also taken. Findings from this study showed that the reported levels of motivation to engage with writing, of reluctant writers, improved significantly as a result of the treatment and that the treatment had a significantly positive impact on the writing performance of all groups of students. The results from this research suggest that the proposed models of engagement with writing and reluctance to write include important aspects of the two constructs. The study also shows that a self-regulation strategy development intervention set in a regular classroom environment can have positive impacts for all students, and suggests that reluctant writers benefit the most from such interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of the relationship of the Crown in New Zealand with iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Healy, Susan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the nature of the relationship that the state in New Zealand, the Crown, has established with M&#257;ori as a tribally-based people. Despite the efforts of recent New Zealand Governments to address the history of Crown injustice to M&#257;ori, the relationship of the Crown with Iwi M&#257;ori continues to be fraught with contradictions and tension. It is the argument of the thesis that the tension exists because the Crown has imposed a social, political, and economic order that is inherently contradictory to the social, political, and economic order of the M&#257;ori tribal world. Overriding an order where relationships are negotiated and alliances built between autonomous groups, the Crown constituted itself as a government with single, undivided sovereignty, used its unilateral power to introduce policy and legislation that facilitated the dispossession of wh&#257;nau and hap&#363; of their resources and their authority in the land, and enshrined its own authority and capitalist social relations instead. The thesis is built round a critical reading of five Waitangi Tribunal reports, namely the Muriwhenua Fishing Report, Mangonui Sewerage Report, The Te Roroa Report, Muriwhenua Land Report, and Te Whanau o Waipareira Report.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">S'an&#233;antir ou s'&#233;panouir: avatars d'asc&#233;tisme anorexique dans la litt&#233;rature fran&#231;aise du XIXe au XXIe si&#232;cle</field><field name="creator">Wrigley-Brown, Lynette</field><field name="description">Intrigued by a striking resemblance between certain behaviour, characteristics and preoccupations in characters from French literary texts, on the one hand, and in modern-day anorexics on the other, we have undertaken a study of representations of abnegation.  In reading female ascetic piety, particularly in an extreme and sterile form known as &#8220;scrupulosity,&#8221; as it is seen in Madame Gervaisais, by the Goncourt Brothers, and in the representation of adolescence in L&#8217;Histoire de ma vie, by George Sand, I aim to explore similarities and differences between these two &#8220;conditions.&#8221;  Next, certain texts by Zola, Vincent van Gogh and Simone de Beauvoir allow me to study a wide range of responses to the same questions as those which motivate anorexia nervosa and scrupulosity: questions of balance between the spiritual and the material, of perfectionism, of excessive obedience, of refusal of pleasure, and of a capacity for self-destruction.  Paradoxically, all the &#8220;characters&#8221; studied here (including those &#8220;characters&#8221; created by means of autobiography or letter writing) are represented as possessing tendencies which define these two &#8220;conditions,&#8221; tendencies which are capable of leading either to extraordinary fulfilment, an unheard of creativity, or to self-destruction motivated by a desire for perfect virtue.  Reading these texts in the light of anorexia nervosa allows new insights into them, in turn offering a new perspective on anorexia nervosa, suggesting its long involvement in the cultural history of Europe.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anorexia</field><field name="subject">scrupulosity</field><field name="subject">scruples</field><field name="subject">asceticism</field><field name="subject">scrupule</field><field name="subject">anorexie</field><field name="subject">Mouret</field><field name="subject">Gervaisais</field><field name="subject">Zaza</field><field name="subject">Sand</field><field name="subject">Goncourt</field><field name="subject">Beauvoir</field><field name="subject">Gogh</field><field name="subject">asc&#233;tisme</field><field name="subject">abnegation</field><field name="subject">Zola</field><field name="subject">abn&#233;gation</field><field name="subject">Histoire de ma vie</field><field name="subject">perfectionism</field><field name="subject">perfectionnisme</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420209 French</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440207 Religion and society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hamlet's transformation: An application of Stanislav Grof's holotropic theory to adolescents who are experiencing grief and loss</field><field name="creator">Bray, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis extends Stanislav Grof's work on psycho-spiritual transformation by considering whether adolescents can experience what he and Christina Grof (1989, 1990) have called &#8222;spiritual emergency&#8223; (SE). Grof contends that the human psyche, when stimulated by new material originating from loss experiences, may spontaneously reorganise itself. This process either unfolds gently as spiritual emergence or overwhelms the individual as SE. This thesis examines Grof&#8223;s holotropic theory, using Shakespeare&#8223;s Hamlet as an illustration, to establish theoretically how SE might be experienced and observed in an adolescent. Hamlet&#8223;s powerful responses to the death of his father, the loss of his inheritance and the remarriage of his mother are explored via Grof&#8223;s extended cartography of the human psyche and a close analysis of Hamlet&#8223;s soliloquies. As counselling verbatim, the soliloquies provide an important opportunity to discuss how significant experiences of loss have the potential for developmental transformation in adolescence. The possible incidence of SE in adolescence raises questions about how we identify, understand and support young people undergoing this process of transformation. In addition to analysing Hamlet&#8223;s experiences in the light of Grof&#8223;s theoretical framework, the thesis discusses the broader literature on grief and loss and the work of a range of other developmental, spiritual, transpersonal and integral psychologists and philosophers. The thesis engages Grof&#8223;s ideas critically and assesses their relevance for adolescent counselling practice and counsellor education in the New Zealand context. This thesis challenges some widely accepted views among counsellors and educators. It argues for the acknowledgement and identification of the SE experience and recommends that further research be conducted with adolescents. It concludes that an understanding of the deeper dimensions of personal experience can assist professionals to be more effectively engaged with young people throughout their educational journeys.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedded speech recognition systems</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Octavian</field><field name="description">Apart from recognition accuracy, decoding speed and vocabulary size, another point of consideration when developing a practical ASR application is the adaptability of the system. An ASR system is more useful if it can cope with changes that are introduced by users, for example, new words and new grammar rules. In addition, the system can also automatically update the underlying knowledge sources, such as language model probabilities, for better recognition accuracy. Since the knowledge sources need to be adaptable, it is in&#176;exible to statically combine them. It is because on-line modi&#175;cation becomes di&#177;cult once all the knowledge sources have been combined into one static search space. The second objective of the thesis is to develop an algorithm which allows dynamic integration of knowledge sources during decoding. In this approach, each knowledge source is represented by a weighted &#175;nite state transducer (WFST). The knowledge source that is subject to adaptation is factorized from the entire search space. The adapted knowledge source is then combined with the others during decoding. In this thesis, we propose a generalized dynamic WFST composition algorithm, which avoids the creation of non- coaccessible paths, performs weight look-ahead and does not impose any constraints to the topology of the WFSTs. Experimental results on Wall Street Journal (WSJ1) 20k- word trigram task show that our proposed approach has a better word accuracy versus real-time factor characteristics than other dynamic composition approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech Recognition</field><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of anti-tumour activity of the DNA binding agent SN 28049</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Catherine</field><field name="description">SN 28049 is a novel DNA intercalating anti-cancer drug developed at the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre as part of ongoing research into topoisomerase II poisons with high activity against solid tumours. SN 28049 was curative against murine Colon 38 tumours, a model of colorectal adenocarcinoma which is generally unresponsive to topoisomerase II poisons (1), while two clinically used topoisomerase II poisons, doxorubicin and etoposide, were respectively moderately active and inactive against this tumour. The aim of this thesis was to use human tumour cell lines in order to develop an understanding of the mechanism of anti-tumour activity of SN 28049. Topoisomerase II poisons induce DNA double strand breaks which signal through multiple pathways, and two of these, the &#947;-phosphorylation of histone H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) and the induction of p53 protein were investigated in HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma cells and in NZM3, NZM6 and NZM52 melanoma cells. SN 28049 induced only a small increase in &#947;- H2AX phosphorylation, comparable to that mediated by doxorubicin and etoposide. However, a low concentration of SN 28049 (25 nM) stimulated p53 protein expression in HCT 116 cells to levels in excess of those observed in response to doxorubicin or etoposide. The activation of p53 by SN 28049 cells was investigated using the HCT 116 line and an isogenic line lacking p53 expression. As assessed by expression of the representative p53 transcriptional targets FAS, p21WAF1 and survivin, SN 28049 was considerably more active than doxorubicin or etoposide in stimulating the p53 pathway. However, there was little evidence of SN 28049 inducing either G1 arrest or apoptosis in these cells. SN 28049 instead induced p53-dependent G1 tetraploid arrest following mitotic failure in the absence of cell division. In response to a five-hour drug exposure and further growth in the absence of drug, HCT 116 p53 +/+ cells arrested with a &#8216;4N&#8217; DNA content, expressing high levels of G1-phase cyclin E. At later times, senescence associated &#946;-galactosidase (SA-&#946;-Gal) activity increased, indicative of senescence. Under similar conditions, HCT 116 p53 -/- cells continued cycling with a DNA content of &gt;4N. In contrast, doxorubicin added under similar conditions to HCT 116 p53 +/+ cells caused cycle arrest with an &#8216;8N&#8217; DNA content and signs of senescence, while etoposide induced only signs of senescence. The activity of SN 28049 and a series of its analogues was also compared to that of doxorubicin and etoposide in both the HCT 116 p53 +/+ and p53 -/- lines using growth inhibition assays. When cells were cultured at a density that allows exponential growth, SN 28049 selectively inhibited HCT 116 cells expressing wild-type p53, and the selectivity was related to potency. However, responses to SN28049 were not distinguished qualitatively from doxorubicin and etoposide. In contrast, under conditions of high cell density, SN28049 and several active analogues maintained selectivity for HCT 116 p53 +/+ over p53 -/- cells while doxorubicin and etoposide lost their selectivity. The ability of SN 28049 to activate p53 was retained at high cell density. It is concluded that SN28049 has two cellular actions. The first, shared with doxorubicin and etoposide, is mediated by topoisomerase II-induced DNA damage, is cell cycle non-specific and leads to cell cycle arrest. The second, which is unique to SN28049 and is most easily observed in a cell line (HCT 116) growing at high cell density to ensure minimal expression of active topoisomerase II, involves bypass of mitosis and entry into a G1 tetraploid phase and is characterised by high expression of p53 and its downstream products. It is hypothesised that this second cellular action could explain the high in vivo activity of SN 28049.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability in karst resources management: the case of the Gunung Sewu in Java</field><field name="creator">Sunkar, Arzyana</field><field name="description">Although land is abundant, biophysical constraints on Gunung Sewu Karst in Java, Indonesia, limit soil fertility and water availability. Gunung Sewu farmers depend heavily on the land for their survival yet they have a scarcity of the resources needed for productivity. Faced with the need to survive, they have developed cultural, physical and social self-insurance strategies to increase the return from those resources available to minimise the risks to their food security and income. Strategies for land use choices are driven by socio-economic circumstances (social, economical and cultural needs), while strategies for income are driven more by the physical environment. The study confirms that human adaptation strategies are as important as environmental circumstances in determining the consequences of people&#8217;s interaction with the land. The rocky desertification that occurs in the area reflects the unsustainability of current rural practices, although this cannot be blamed entirely on current practices. Historical analysis of Gunung Sewu land use shows that environmental degradation is often triggered by external social factors such as population growth, politics and economic problems as much as, or more than, by the limitations imposed by biophysical factors. Therefore, the sustainability of current resource management in the area cannot be measured by the current extent of land degradation. Instead, there is a need to focus on the causes that underpin the dynamics of a system, not the effects (impacts), i.e. the underlying causes of people&#8217;s motivation and behaviour with respect to resource management must be considered. In effect, sustainability indicators for resource management in Gunung Sewu should be addressed through causal indicators portraying the interactions between people and environment. A system dynamics approach coupled with steps from PICABUE methodology are used to develop sustainability indicators. From a system dynamics perspective, five interacting sub-systems make up the resource management system of Gunung Sewu, i.e. water, demography, food production, economy and culture (where water is treated as exogenous factor). Out of these subsystems, culture is the most influential but the least influenced. The sustainability indicators for the system are soil conservation effort, interest in traditional farming, education level, births, onfarm income, outmigration, rice consumption and crops consumption, each crammed with sensitive parameters, most of which belong to the culture sub-system. This suggests the important of cultural indicators in an evaluation of the resource management sustainability of a resource-poor area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gunung Sewu Karst</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Evaluation of Nanoparticulate Drug Delivery Systems for Anticancer Drugs</field><field name="creator">Ganta, Srinivas</field><field name="description">The main aim of this study was to develop nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for chlorambucil (CHL) and asulacrine (ASL). CHL is a DNA alkylating agent. In an attempt to alter the pharmacokinetics (short half-life, rapid clearance and high volume of distribution) and improve the anticancer activity, CHL was incorporated into a lipid nanosphere (LN) formulation. The LN were composed of soybean oil as the internal oil phase, egg lecithin as the primary emulsifier, cholesterol as the phospholipid layer stabilizer, and water as the external phase. PEG-modified (long circulating) and DOTAP-modified (cationic) LN were prepared to evade the reticulo-endothelial system and enhance cellular delivery, respectively. LN prepared by ultra-sonicater and microfluidizer had an average particle size below 200 nm, with a CHL encapsulation efficiency of over 97%. Zeta potential of the LN ranged from -30.6 to +41.5 mV. The LN exhibited good physical stability over six months at 4&#176;C and 25&#176;C. In vitro evaluation on SKOV-3 cells showed that the cytotoxicity and the pro-apoptotic activity of CHL were significantly enhanced when given in the LN formulation compared to the CHL solution (P&lt;0.05). An altered pharmacokinetics with increased plasma AUC and elimination half-life, and reduced clearance were observed after intravenous administration of CHL incorporated LN compared to a CHL solution (P&lt;0.01). A marked reduction in the tissue distribution of CHL was also noted when it was given in LN. In addition, CHL incorporated in LN showed greater anticancer activity compared with the CHL solution in colon-38 tumour-bearing mice (P&lt;0.01). These results suggest that LN could be an effective parenteral carrier for CHL delivery. ASL is an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. In an attempt to improve its efficacy by altering the pharmacokinetic profile, ASL was formulated as a nanocrystal suspension (NS). The NS was consisting of ASL nanoparticles produced by high pressure homogenization and stabilized by stabilizers. The lyophilized NS exhibited good stability over three months at 4&#176;C and 25&#176;C. The dissolution and solubility of ASL were enhanced in NS form compared to un-milled ASL (P&lt;0.05). Initial peak plasma concentration and AUC were remarkably reduced in the plasma after intravenous administration of NS compared to the ASL solution (P&lt; 0.01). This suggests reduced systemic exposure to the drug.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequency selective wallpaper for mitigating indoor wireless interference</field><field name="creator">Sung, Hui-Hsia</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an effective technique for interference control with the use of frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) in indoor wireless environments. An FSS with a bandstop frequency response was applied to an existing wall as a wallpaper to transform the wall into a frequency- selective (FS) wall. The FS-Wall can be made to deliberately filter out undesired interference, and accordingly improve wireless system performance. In-situ measurements have shown that the FS-Wall prototype can attenuate 5.3GHz{5.8GHz (IEEE802.11a) transmissions by 15dB in addition to the unmodified wall attenuation, whereas other radio services, such as cellular telephony at 1.8GHz, experience only little attenuation. The FS-Wall created performed consistently (with acceptable attenuation levels) with varying signal incident angles from 0&#177; to 56&#177;. The 15dB reduction in signal strength is considered sufficient to isolate a system from external interference, and could potentially improve a WLAN system throughput by 2.2 times. The FSS performance has been examined intensely by both equivalent circuit modelling and practical measurements. Factors that influence FSS performance such as the FSS element dimensions, element conductivities, dielectric substrates adjacent to the FSS, and signal incident angles were investigated. By keeping the elements small and densely packed, a largely angle- insensitive FSS was developed as a promising prototype for FS-wallpaper. Such an FS-wallpaper can be applied directly to the wall (with no intervening spacing) with insignificant mutual interaction between the FSS and the wall. Accordingly, the resultant FS-Wall can be modelled by cascading the effects of the FS-wallpaper and the wall. Good agreement between the modelled and the measured results was observed, which suggests that the equivalent circuit model can be used confidently to assist FSS design. Fabrication techniques and practical installation issues associated with the development of FSS for indoor wireless applications were also investigated in this thesis. With the use of an angle-insensitive bandstop FSS, this research has demonstrated a feasible solution for mitigating external interference into indoor wireless systems. This research work has linked the fields of antenna design, communication systems and building architecture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vulnerability of Indigenous Forests in Changing Landscapes</field><field name="creator">Aleksa, Adriana Irene</field><field name="description">Indigenous forests all over the world are suffering habitat alteration, loss of original extensions, and increase of isolation levels, affecting their existence and sustainability. In New Zealand about 70% of the original forest cover has been destroyed since human settlement, converting them to a rare and threatened resource. Part of the problem is because native forests are often immersed in a landscape where other land uses are competing for the same space. Effective conservation management of these indigenous forest remnants requires information about their vulnerability to threats, in space and time. Few studies provide an integrated assessment of the extent to which socio- economic effects are responsible for native vegetation vulnerability and how these relationships change through time. In this study socio-economic drivers at different scales are related to land cover changes. To analyse vulnerability of indigenous forests a temporal dataset was developed from aerial photography for the years 1942, 1961, 1984, and satellite images for the years 1999 and 2006. They were managed within a GIS, recording the extent and distribution of these forests and other principal land covers in a study area of ca. 80,000 ha in the Northland region. Information about incentives to land production and to conservation was compared to changes of composition, configuration and conversion of land cover. Spatial conditioners of change, such as elevation, land use capability and land legal protection, were also assessed as possible constrainers of indigenous forest loss. Results showed that the incentives to land production had changed their significance for vulnerability of indigenous forests through time. These became conditioned by other land covers and incentives to conservation, and besides, indigenous forest was a quite stable cover where the physical characteristics of their location were unsuitable for land production. I concluded that at scale of decades, changes in area of indigenous forest were reversible; non- linear; driven by political, institutional and economic changes but that, biophysical characteristics of the landscape can preclude conversion. Such conclusions may help to set priorities for the long term protection and management of indigenous forests.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than wives?: a study of four Church Missionary Society wives in nineteenth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ross, Catherine R.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Green Prescription physical activity intervention: a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary health care</field><field name="creator">Elley, Carolyn Raina</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 'Green Prescription' physical activity intervention amongst less-active adults in primary care, using the Auckland Heart Study (AHS) questionnaire to assess change in activity. The validity of two physical-activity questionnaires, the AHS and the GSS questionnaires, was assessed initially, comparing their performance with 7-day activity diaries and pedometers amongst less-active adults in primary care. A cluster randomised controlled trial was then conducted in the waikato region of New Zealand, with 42 general practices randomised to give the Green Prescription or 'usual care'. A systematic screening process identified less-active 40-79 year-old patients. Main outcome measures included change in physical activity, quality of life (SF-36), coronary risk, and blood pressure, over a twelve-month period. Costs of the programme and offset costs of primary and secondary health care utilisation, productivity, and exercising, were collected prospectively for cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective. The AHS questionnaire was found to have adequate reliability and validity, and to be the most appropriate measurement tool for use in primary care research. In the Green Prescription trial, 74% of general practitioners (n=117) and 66% of screened eligible patients (n=878) participated. Follow-up rate, at one year, was 85% (n=750). Mean total energy expenditure increased by 9.4 kcal/kg/week (p=0.001) and leisure exercise by 2.7.kcal/kg/week (p=0.02) or 34 minutes/week more in the intervention group than the control group (p=0.04). The proportion of the intervention group undertaking 21/2 hours/week of leisure exercise increased by 9.72% (p=0.003) more than in the control group (NNT=10.3). SF-36 measures of 'general health', 'role-physical', 'vitality', and &#8216;bodily pain' improved significantly more in the intervention group (p&lt;0.05), as a result of the Green Prescription intervention. There was a trend towards decreasing blood Pressure, no increase in adverse events, and no statistically significant difference in four-year risk of coronary heart disease. The cost of delivering the Green prescription was $170.45 per participant from a funder's perspective and $37.16 (95%CI:-$945.21,$1019.53) from a societal perspective. To increase leisure-time exercise by one hour per week cost $25.36 per month from a programme funder's perspective and $5.47 (95%CI:-$138.90,$149.84)per month from a societal perspective. The AHS questionnaire was considered reliable and valid. The Green Prescription intervention is effective in increasing physical activity and improving quality of life over 12 months without evidence of adverse effects. The intervention is more cost-effective than other physical activity interventions reported in the literature and may be cost-saving in terms of long-term health gains.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular pathology of the hyper immunoglobulin M syndrome</field><field name="creator">Ameratunga, Rohan</field><field name="description">The Hyper Immunoglobulin M syndrome (HIM) is a rare primary immune deficiency disorder characterised by an inability to produce immunoglobulin isotypes other than IgM and IgD. The B cell-surface antigen CD40, and its conjugate T cell counter-structure, CD40 ligand (CD154), mediate immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgE and IgG4 in the presence of cytokines such as interleukin 4. Patients with the X-linked form of the hyper IgM syndrome (XHIM) have mutations in the CD40 ligand gene which is the molecular basis for impaired immunoglobulin isotype switching in XHIM. This thesis is a tale of two HIM patients, one with XHIM (patient H1) and the other (patient M1) with a novel immune defect which has yet to be fully characterised. Analysis of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) products of the CD40 ligand gene from patient H1 revealed two mutant transcripts, one missing exon 4 and the other missing both exons 3 and 4. In addition, the cells of patient H1 also produce small quantities of wild type cD40 ligand transcripts. Molecular analysis has shown that this complex splicing defect is precipitated by a point mutation at the invariant 3&#8217; splice acceptor site with a g&#8594;c substitution at position -1 (tcacGTA) of intron 3. RT-PCR studies have shown that the cells of the mother of patient H1 produce both wild type and deleted CD40 ligand transcripts, consistent with her carrier state. Genomic sequencing of intron 3 has shown that she is heterozygous for the point mutation (tcacgEGTA), confirming her carrier status. Analysis of other family members, including the sister and the maternal grandmother, has indicated that they have not inherited the mutation. Patients with XHIM are predisposed to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis and to Cryptosporidiosis. Studies of T cell function in patient H1 has identified a defect in antigenspecific proliferation which provides an explanation for the susceptibility of XHIM patients to opportunistic infections. In contrast to patient H1, the cells of patient M1 have wild type CD40 ligand sequence and express normal amounts of cell surface CD40 ligand indicating that he does not have XHIM. Flow cytometry and in vitro antibody synthesis studies have shown that the B cells of this patient are able to undergo immunoglobulin isotype switching both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike the mild T cell defect shown in XHIM patients, a severe T cell defect is present in this patient who also has impaired CD40-induced B cell function. The impaired CD40 function may be secondary to the T cell defect. The demonstration of wild type CD40 ligand transcripts in the patient with a splicing defect may explain the milder phenotype seen in some XHIM patients. The identification of the T cell defect should result in re-classification of XHIM as a combined immune deficiency disorder The characterisation of patient M1 extends the phenotypic spectrum of the hyper IgM syndrome to include a severe T cell defect in the context of normal CD40 ligand structure and function.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between reductive metabolism, DNA damage and antitumour activity of the hypoxia-activated prodrug PR-104 in preclinical models</field><field name="creator">Singleton, Rachelle</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is a characteristic of solid tumours and a potentially important therapeutic target. PR-104, a prodrug designed to target hypoxic cells, is currently in phase II clinical trial. PR- 104 is converted systemically to the alcohol PR-104A which is reduced selectively under hypoxia to its hydroxylamine and amine metabolites. This thesis aims to determine the mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity of PR-104 in preclinical tumour models. Specific objectives were to identify biomarkers of response to PR-104, and to ascertain which features of tumours determine their sensitivity to PR-104 monotherapy. PR-104A demonstrated hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity for all nine human tumour cell lines investigated in culture, but with widely differing hypoxic/oxic differentials because of large differences in aerobic cytotoxicity. Hypoxic cytotoxicity correlated with DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) frequency (measured using the alkaline comet assay), suggesting ICL are invariably responsible for hypoxic cytotoxicity. There was a similar relationship between ICL and aerobic cytotoxicity, except for four lines with very low rates of aerobic PR-104A reduction. Nonetheless, monotherapy activity of PR-104 in tumour xenografts of all nine cell lines showed a strong correlation with ICL at 24 hours (r2 = 0.733, p&lt;0.001) indicating that DNA crosslinking is the dominant mechanism of cytotoxicity in the pharmacologically relevant dose range. A hypoxia-selective increase in the DNA double strand break marker &#947;H2AX was also observed in all cell lines after PR-104A in vitro, with kinetics and cell cycle distribution consistent with DNA replication arrest at ICL. This marker also correlated with cytotoxicity in tumours (r2 = 0.465, p&lt;0.001). The wide variation in &#947;H2AX levels between cell lines at equivalent cytotoxicity suggested &#947;H2AX is less useful than ICL as an absolute biomarker, but has possible utility for comparing response of aerobic and hypoxic cells within the same tumour. Reduced PR-104A metabolites in tumours also correlated with cytotoxicity (r2 = 0.585, p&lt;0.05), but less well than for ICL. Unexpectedly, the results suggest that rates of intratumour activation of PR-104A are not primarily determined by hypoxia (measured using pimonidazole binding) or expression of the major hypoxic reductase cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, and that aerobic nitroreduction is a major contributor to its monotherapy antitumour activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypoxia</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">biomarkers</field><field name="subject">bioreductive agents</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of steroids by human mammary tissues</field><field name="creator">Couch, Ronald Alexander Fyfe</field><field name="description">Human mammary tissue was incubated in vitro with [7-3H] dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-sulphate) and in agreement with other investigators this steroid conjugate was metabolized to DHA and other steroid products.

(Margaret Jane)</field><field name="description">Transplacental glucose transport is vital to fetal growth. Although the presence of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3 has been demonstrated in mammalian placenta, the factors regulating these genes remain unclear. Therefore, the overall aim of these studies was to clone ovine GLUT1 (oGLUT1) and oGLUT3 cDNAs, and to use these to investigate gene expression during ovine placental development and function. Ovine GLUT1 (~2.2 kb) and oGLUT3 (483 bp) cDNAs were isolated and cloned. Sequence analysis demonstrated that oGLUT1 showed high homology (97 - 99%) with other mammalian species, whereas oGLUT3 did not (84 - 88%). Northern analysis demonstrated that oGLUT1 mRNA abundance increased from d 45 to d 120 of gestation, then decreased towards term (d 145 &#177; 2), whereas oGLUT3 mRNA abundance increased throughout gestation. Western analysis showed oGLUT1 protein levels increased during late gestation, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of oGLUT1. Localisation experiments revealed spatio-temporal differences in ovine placental GLUT expression. In early gestation (d 45), oGLUT1 protein was restricted to fetal trophoblast cells. By mid gestation oGLUT1 immuno-signal was predominantly localised to maternal villous and endometrial tissue. By late gestation oGLUT1 mRNA was most strongly localised to maternal syncytiotrophoblast and villous tissue, whereas oGLUT3 was predominantly localised to fetal trophoblast cells. Placental oGLUT expression was regulated differently by acute (3 - 8 h) versus long-term (&gt;6 d) alterations in late gestation maternal glucose supply. No evidence was found for regulation of placental oGLUT gene expression by long-term maternal undernutrition, but oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 mRNA and oGLUT1 protein were elevated by short-term (24 - 48 h) maternal hypoglycemia. Acute maternal hyperglycemia transiently increased oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 mRNA abundance, whereas oGLUT1 protein (but not mRNA) levels increased after long-term maternal hyperglycemia. Infusion studies provided no conclusive evidence for regulation of placental oGLUTs by long-term administration of growth hormone (GH) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the late gestation fetus. Following acute (4 h) fetal IGF-1 infusion, placental oGLUT3 mRNA abundance was greater in growth restricted (placental embolisation) than in normal fetuses, although the reason for this difference remained equivocal. This thesis describes isolation, cloning and sequence analysis of oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 cDNAs. These studies confirmed the presence of GLUTI and GLUT3 mRNA in ovine placenta, and demonstrated ontogenetic and nutritional regulation of placental oGLUT1 and oGLUT3. In addition, these results indicated that regulation of placental oGLUTs may occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Binding capacity of albumin and renal disease</field><field name="creator">Dromgoole, Sydney Herbert</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in presympathetic neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat</field><field name="creator">Comer, Alison Mary</field><field name="description">The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) contains a population of bulbospinal neurons which are critically involved in the tonic and reflex control of blood pressure. They project to the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord and excite sympathetic preganglionic neurons. The RVL region also contains the C1 adrenergic group of neurons, some of which are also bulbospinal RVL vasomotor neurons. The objective of this study was to investigate RVL neurons at the cellular and molecular level, to gain a better understanding of the properties of this heterogeneous population of neurons. Two main approaches were used to achieve this. The first studied the expression of several genes in RVL micropunches and single acutely dissociated RVL neurons using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The second utilised antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (aODNs) to reduce expression of two adrenaline-synthesising genes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), in C1 adrenergic neurons in the RVL. Semi-nested RT-PCR analysis of tissue micropunched from the RVL region of adult rats established the expression of mRNA transcripts for glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), TH, PNMT, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), noradrenaline transporter (NET), glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2), neuronal glutamate transporter (EAACI) and glial glutamate transporter (GLT). The expression of mRNA for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) and the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT-1) was also detected in rat brainstem. The micropunch technique combined with RT-PCR offers a simple non-radioactive way to identify genes being expressed in the RVL and other medullary regions. Single neurons were acutely dissociated from the RVL of 13 - 2l day old rats, and classified as spinally projecting or non-spinal by the presence or absence of retrogradely-transported fluorescent beads injected into the upper thoracic segments. Dissociated bulbospinal RVL neurons did not exhibit any spontaneous firing, and there was no evidence of any pacemaker-like properties. A fast-activating (spike-like) inward current could be elicited by depolarising voltage steps, and could be abolished by application of tetrodotoxin. Extracellular application of either kainic acid or L-glutamic acid onto RVL cells under voltage-clamp conditions elicited dose-dependent inward currents. Individual neurons were collected by aspiration into a glass micropipette and the cell contents analysed by RT-PCR. Detection of either GAPDH or NSE mRNA was used as the criterion for selecting cells for further analysis, and 80% of the neuron samples tested expressed one of these genes. A subpopulation of spinally-projecting neurons expressed PNMT or TH (50%), indicating that they were catecholaminergic. Bulbospinal RVL neurons were also found to express mRNA for the MR (45% of those tested), the GR (5%), NET (10%), and EAAC1 (58%). GLT, GAD67 and GAT-1 were not expressed in any bulbospinal neurons, but they were detected in 5 - l0% of non-spinal neurons tested. Expression of mRNA for MR, EAAC1 and NET was also observed in subpopulations of PNMT-positive and -negative bulbospinal neurons. Expression of NET protein, assessed by immunohistochemistry, was found to be similar to NET mRNA expression in C1 adrenergic neurons in the RVL. These results indicate that single-cell RT-PCR is a powerful method for elucidating the functional characteristics of a defined neuronal population, and that it is possible to perform whole-cell patch-clamp recording prior to RT-PCR analysis, allowing linkage of the molecular analysis of mRNA expression to the electrophysiological properties of these neurons. The method is very sensitive, enabling low copy-number mRNA transcripts to be detected, and can be used to provide key information about blood-pressure regulation at the molecular and cellular level. The final part of this study used aODNs to attempt to knockdown expression of TH or PNMT in C1 neurons in the RVL. The aODNs were either injected or infused unilaterally into the RVL of adult rats in vivo, and 4 - 14 days later the animals were sacrificed and the expression of TH or PNMT protein assessed using immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for TH was unchanged by injection or infusion of an aODN targeting TH mRNA. Immunoreactivity for PNMT was decreased in 2 out of l0 infusion experiments, but this was achieved using an aODN with one base pair mismatch to the PNMT mRNA sequence, and could not be repeated with aODNs of the correct sequence. This study was the first attempt to target the PNMT gene with aODNs, and although preliminary in nature, it provided some useful information for future studies of this system. Antisense ODN suppression of genes in the RVL may prove to be an interesting future avenue for investigating the functional significance of specific genes being expressed in the RVL region.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Involvement of zinc in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Cuajungco, Math P</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of cortisol in the human feto-placental unit</field><field name="creator">Dormer, Robyn Alethea</field><field name="description">A method for assaying cortisol and cortisone using chromatography on either Paper or Sephadex LH-20 columns, followed by competitive protein binding, has been applied to umbilical cord and maternal plasma samples.

For cord venous plasma, the mean level of cortisol was 5.6 &#177; 1.5 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 6) and of cortisone was 13.5 &#177; 2.4 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 6). Maternal plasma gave a mean value of cortisol of 42.3 &#177; 4.5 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 6) and of cortisone of 6.2 &#177; 0.9 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 6).

Further assays employing a radioimmunoassay for cortisol, and competitive protein binding for cortisone have been applied to cord plasma samples of prematurely-delivered fetuses, after treatment of betamethasone to the mother (12 mg/day for one or two days). The mean value of cortisol in samples from fetuses delivered up to 24 hours after treatment was 2.6 &#177; 2.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 4) and the mean value of cortisone was 2.2 &#177; 2.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 14).

Kinetic parameters of the human placental 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system were assessed using a microsomal preparation in 50% glycerol buffer. The Michaelis constant for cortisol was 1.88 x 10-6M, in the presence of NADP, and 0.56 x 10-6M, in the presence of NAD. Vmax values varied with concentration of cofactor, increasing from 0.031 to 0.076 &#181;moles cortisone produced per minute per mg protein with increasing concentration of NADP from 0.036 mM to 1.2 mM. The value of vmax, for an initial concentration of 1.2 mM NAD, was 0.0598. Substrate inhibition was not evident at the level of cortisol employed (up to a cortisol concentration of 1 x 10-4M). Corticosterone, cortisone, progesterone and pregnenolone inhibited enzyme activity. The results of this study suggest that fetal cortisol is produced by the fetal adrenal, and fetal cortisone originates primarily from the conversion of maternal cortisol to cortisone across the placenta, by the action of the 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural progenitor cells in the Huntington's Disease human brain</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Maurice A</field><field name="description">The recent demonstration of endogenous progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain raises the exciting possibility that these undifferentiated cells may be able to generate new neurons for cell replacement in diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells in the rodent brain subependymal layer (SEL), adjacent to the caudate nucleus, proliferate and differentiate into neurons and glial cells but no previous study has characterised the human SEL or shown neurogenesis in the diseased human brain. In this study, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the regional anatomy and staining characteristics of the normal and HD brain SEL using light and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results demonstrated that the normal and HD SEL contained migrating neuroblasts, glial cells and precursor cells but there were more of each cell type present in the HD brain, and that the increase in cell numbers correlated with HD neuropathological grade. The normal and HD SEL was stained with a proliferative marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to label dividing cells. The results showed a significant increase in the number of dividing cells in the HD brain that correlated with HD grade and with CAG repeat length. Furthermore, the results showed that neurogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by co-localisation of PCNA and the neuronal marker &#946;III-tubulin. Also, gliogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by the co-localisation of PCNA with the glial marker GFAP. These studies also revealed a 2.6 fold increase in the number of new neurons in the HD SEL. PCNA positive cells were distributed throughout the SEL overlying the caudate nucleus but most notably the ventral and central regions of the SEL adjacent to the caudate nucleus contained the highest number of proliferating cells. I examined the SEL for mature cell markers and demonstrated many of the same cell types that are present in the normal striatum. With the exception of neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, there was a reduction in the number of mature neurons in the HD SEL. The NPY neurons were more abundant in the HD SEL suggesting they play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. The results in this thesis provide evidence of increased progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the diseased adult human brain and indicate the regenerative potential of the human brain. These findings may be of major relevance to the development of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intracellular signalling by arachidonic acid metabolites</field><field name="creator">Berry, Elicia Bee Ean</field><field name="description">In intrauterine tissues, pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs) have been identified as key mediators in the maintenance of pregnancy and parturition. The rise in PGD2 detected in the amniotic fluid before labour prompted the research presented in this thesis which describes the effects of 15-deoxy &#916;12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a non-enzymatic metabolite of PGD2, on amnion-derived WISH and JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells as models of the amnion and chorion trophoblasts, respectively.15d-PGJ2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines in a concentration-dependent fashion (2.5-10 &#181;M). Apoptosis was characterised by condensation of chromatin (visualised after Hoechst 33342 staining), appearance of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation upon electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis, and activation of caspase-3. Apoptotic cell death was inhibited in the presence of serum (0.5% w/v) and albumin, not serumderived growth factors (insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2 or epidermal growth factor (EGF), was determined as the key survival factor. Since 15d-PGJ2 is reported to activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-&#947;, the activities of PPARs were assessed using JEG3 cells transfected with a PPAR-response element reporter construct (pTK-PPREx3-luc). The PPAR-&#947;-specific ligand, rosiglitazone, induced PPRE mediated activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while the PPAR-&#947;-specific irreversible inhibitor, GW9662, fully inhibited this induction. However, GW9662 only partially inhibited 15d-PGJ2-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 may also activate either of the other isoforms. The expressions of PPAR-&#945; and -&#948; were identified in amnion, choriodecidua and placental membranes and PPAR-&#948; was significantly increased all tissues with labour. PPAR-&#945; expression was reduced in chorio-decidua, but was significantly higher in placenta with labour. The changes observed with labour suggest that regulation of PPAR expression and function may have a role in the mechanisms that maintain pregnancy or initiate labour. The anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2 were also investigated by measuring interleukin (IL)-1&#946;-stimulated prostaglandin and cytokine productions by WISH cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 for 3 hours. 15d-PGJ2 exerted differential effects that were dependent upon its concentration. At low nanomolar physiologic concentrations (1-10 nM), 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2, but not cytokine (IL-6/IL-8) production or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression. This effect was attenuated by GW9662, by transfection with dominant negative PPAR constructs, and was reproduced by rosiglitazone. At micromolar (1-10 &#181;M) concentrations, 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated COX-2, PGE2 and cytokine productions and these effects were not blocked by GW9662 or mimicked by rosiglitazone. GW501516 (PPAR-&#948; agonist) also inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2 production, but only at high concentrations (1 &#181;M). IL-1&#946;-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity was significantly inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 (10 &#181;M) and GW501516 (1 &#181;M), but increased by rosiglitazone (10 &#181;M). In conclusion, this is the first report of an effect of 15d-PGJ2 at low nanomolar physiologic concentrations and 15d-PGJ2 mediates its actions through PPAR-&#947; (&lt;0.1 &#181;M) and PPAR-&#947;-independent(1-10 &#181;M) pathways, the latter through inhibition of NF-kB and/or activation of PPAR-&#948;. Further studies on the effect of physiologic concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 on primary gestational tissues will provide understanding on the role(s) 15d-PGJ2 plays in fetal membrane remodelling and its involvement in the inflammatory processes associated with labour and parturition.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies into the release mechanisms of human placental lactogen in vitro</field><field name="creator">Choy, Vernon John</field><field name="description">A procedure to study the in vitro release of HPL was developed.

The aim of work presented in this thesis was to study various T cell responses in mice to one protein of M. leprae, designated the 18 kDa protein. Mice were immunised with recombinant 18 kDa protein and lymph node cells tested later in proliferative T cell assays. The in vitro response was specific for the 18 kDa protein and proliferation dependent on the immunising dose as well as in vitro antigen concentration. The proliferative response required CD4+ T cells, which recognised the antigen in the context of major histocompatibility class II molecules. The T cell response was tested in various recombinant and congenic pairs of mouse strains. BALB/cJ (H-2d), BALB.B (H-2b), B10,BR (H-2k), and B10.M (H-2f) mice were all high responder strains, while the C57BL/10J (H-2b) mouse strain was a low responder. By comparing the genetic characteristics of these high and low responding strains, it was deduced that both H-2 and non-H-2 gene(s) contributed to the magnitude of responsiveness.F1 progeny mice from high and low responder parents responded in a way that showed that high responsiveness was inherited in a dominant manner. Limiting dilution assays indicated that the frequency of cells proliferating in response to the 18 kDa protein correlated with high and low responsiveness of cells from secondary lymphoid tissue. The low frequency of C57BL10/J responding lymphocytes to the 18 kDa protein probably accounted for the reduced in vitro IL-2 production observed in this mouse strain. The T cell response of mice immunised with either the 18 kDa or M. leprae antigens revealed the following. The 18 kDa protein-primed lymph node cells responded to both M. leprae and. M. tuberculosis, suggesting a shared 18 kDa protein T cell epitope by these pathogens. The M. leprae-primed lymph node cells showed no significant response to the 18 kDa protein, but responded similarly to M. leprae and M. tuberculosis antigens. The results were obtained using both bulk cultures and limiting dilution experiments. This indicated that the l8 kDa protein was probably not a dominant antigen in primary murine immune responses against M. leprae. Proliferative T cell epitopes on the 18 kDa protein were examined in several mouse strains. Each mouse strain responded to one dominant region after immunising with 18 kDa protein. The dominant T cell epitope was not identical in all strains. The peptide consisting of residues 106-l25 of the 18 kDa protein was dominant in BALB/cJ and BALB.B mice, whereas the B10.BR mice responded to peptide 31-50 and C57BL/10J mice to peptide 16-35. Lymph node cells primed with individual synthetic peptides and challenged with 18 kDa protein in vitro revealed additional T cell epitopes which were not recognised following immunisation with 18 kDa protein. Cytotoxic T cell epitopes on the l8 kDa molecule were investigated, using an in vitro-priming system. Only one region of the 18 kDa protein elicited cytotoxic T cell responses. This T cell epitope was restricted to mouse strains of H-2b haplotype. The cytotoxic response was a feature of CD8+ T cells and the lysis of target cells depended upon peptide concentration. Cells infected with a recombinant retrovirus carrying the 18 kDa gene were used to prime mice for the induction of cytotoxic T cells in vivo. Cytotoxic T cell responses were detected but none were specific for the 18 kDa protein. Inflammatory T cell responses to the 18 kDa protein were investigated in a number of mouse strains, using a delayed-type hypersensitivity footpad assay. The C57BL/10J mouse strain elicited a similar or even greater response than other strains tested, in contrast to proliferative T cell responses where C57BL/10J was a low responder strain. The number of immunizations influenced the type of immune response elicited in mice. Multiple immunisations with the 18 kDa protein resulted in a reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity response concomitant with the appearance of antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Several 18 kDa-specific T cell lines derived from BALB/cJ, B10.BR, and C57BL/10J mouse strains were generated. T cell lines from the BALB/cJ strain showed characteristics of TH1 and TH0 phenotypes and one line responded to peptide 46-65 of the 18 kDa protein. The B10.BR- and C57BL/10J-derived T cell lines responded to peptide 31-50 and 106-125 respectively and secreted IL-3 upon stimulation, but neither IL-2 nor IL-4 were detected. Various subsets of T cells might play different roles in the immune response against pathogens. The T cell subsets involved in protection might not be identical to those eliciting a strong immunological reaction. T cell responses against intracellular parasites are discussed in relation to factors that govern protective immunity.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genetic study of cleft lip and cleft palate: Auckland, 1960-1976</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Cyril James</field><field name="description">A study of cleft lip and cleft palate was carried out in order to determine whether or not any differences in incidence between Europeans and Polynesians were accompanied by differences in recurrence risks, and to test the genetic hypotheses currently favoured as explanations of familial agggregation of these disorders. An incidence study vas undertaken on all live births in the Auckland urban area for the years 1960 to 1976.Family information was obtained from these probands and from other affected persons or their close relatives, by interview at the cleft palate clinic at Middlemore Hospital. The ascertainment probability for cleft 1ip and cleft palate probands was about 95% and was not correlated with any of the demographic characteristics measured on the probands. After correction for ascertainment, the incidence of cleft palate in Maoris was estimated to be 1.867/1000 1lve births. For Europeans the estimate was 0.643/1000. The corresponding figures for cleft lip with or without cleft palate were 0.397/1000 and 1.195/1000. The sex ratio for cleft palate was 0.485 with heterogeneity between the races. For cleft lip the sax ratio was 0.649 overall. There were no secular or seasonal trends in the incidence of facial clefts and no significant effects of maternal age, or paternal age. The mean birth rank for probands with cleft lip with or without cleft palate was higher than expected. For probands with cleft palate, mean birth rank was not significantly elevated. The pattern of additional malformations in these probands was similar to those reported in similar studies from other centres. The recurrence risk for cleft palate was 1.8% overall. Although it was s1ightly higher in polynesian families than in European families, the difference was nowhere near statistical significance. For cleft lip the recurrence risk was 2.6% overall, with the risk being slightly higher in Polynesian families, but again not significantly higher than in European families. Using current analytical techniques, no discrimination was possible between a generalized single autosomal locus model and a multifactoriar threshold model. A consideration of the parameter estimates for both models suggests that the multifactorial threshold model is the more appropriate one to use for the calculation of recurrence risks in complicated family situations. It is concluded that further family studies of this nature would no longer be warranted unless hypotheses can realistically be tested on the samples available. However, incidence studies in special populations will remain important for hypothesis testing. Following on the work using animal models, a study of face shape within and among races in New Zealand may provide clues to the aetiology of facial clefts, particularly isoleted cleft palate. It will be important to follow changes in incidence over time and discover what effects intermarriage and cultural changes might have on the incidence of facial clefts.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor-1 after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: effects and modes of action on neuronal survival</field><field name="creator">Guan, Jian</field><field name="description">Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)s naturally occur in the central nervous system (CNS) and have an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation during brain development and maturation. IGFs, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)s and their receptors are expressed in damaged brain regions suggesting a role for the IGFs system after brain injury. It is now known that neurons can die some hours, even days after an injury. This programmed death is termed delayed neuronal death (DND). The process of DND might provide a therapeutic window of opportunity for insulin/IGFs to reduce brain damage after an insult. Unilateral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury was induced using a modified Levine rat model. Intracerebral ventricular (ICV) administration was chosen for the delivery of the peptides. The effects of IGF-1 on neuroprotection were tested when given either before or after the HI insult. The dose response of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue was also determined. The distribution of IGF-1 after HI injury was examined following central administration of 3H-IGF-1. The mode of action of IGF-1 on brain rescue was studied by comparing the treatment effects of IGF-1, IGF-2, des-N-(1-3)IGF-1 (des-IGF-1), insulin, N-terminal tripeptide of IGF-1 (GPE) and (+)-5-Methy1-10,11-dihydro-1H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5,10-iminemaleare (MK801). IGF-1 reduced cortical infarction and neuronal loss when given after, but not before, an HI insult in a dose dependent manner. HI brain injury enhanced the penetration of IGF-1 into the brain parenchyma after ICV administration possibly via perivascular pathways and white matter tracks. The effective dose of IGF-I did not alter cortical temperature and serum glucose concentration. Insulin did not alter the outcome at an equimolar dose to IGF-1. The treatment effect of des-IGF-1 was only found at a higher dose. IGF-2 counteracted the treatment effects of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue and tissue uptake of 3H-IGF-1. An equimolar dose of GPE showed a similar response to IGF-1. MK801, an N-methy1-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist did not show significant effect in this model. In summary, IGF-1 was neuroprotective after HI brain injury. The effect of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue depends on the dose and time of delivery. The treatment effect of IGF-1 was independent of hypoglycaemia and hypothermia. The results suggest that this effect is mediated via type one IGF receptors. Distinctive treatment effects by des-IGF-1 and IGF-2 suggested a critical role for IGFBPs on neuronal rescue with IGF-1. A secondary mode of IGF-I action on brain rescue could be through the proteolytic production of GPE. In summary, IGF-1 can improve neuronal outcome in vivo suggesting possible clinic application as a therapeutic agent.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiology of circulating insulin-like growth factor binding proteins: studies in the sheep</field><field name="creator">Gallaher, Brian William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory sensation in asthmatic subjects and matched controls</field><field name="creator">Gaeta, Helen</field><field name="description">Asthmatics most "at risk of death" from their asthma are those that have severe asthma with a history of severe life threatening attacks (SLTAs). Some asthmatics are poor perceivers of the severity of their asthma. It is not known whether these two groups form a homogeneous population. The aim of this thesis was to establish whether this was the case by comparing the sensitivity of asthmatics classified as severe with a history of severe life threatening attacks, asthmatics without a history of SLTAs, mild and moderate asthmatics, and matched controls to externally added resistive loads during inspiration. It also aimed to establish whether poor sensitivity to externally added resistive loads during inspiration was associated with diminished amplitude or increased latency of scalp potentials evoked by inspiratory occlusion. Two studies were conducted to meet the first aim. The first study tested the applicability of the equal variance normal-normal model of signal detection theory as a descriptor of subjects' performance when discriminating between different levels of externally added resistive loads during inspiration. Twelve subjects rated their capacity to distinguish between pairs of resistive loads ranging from 2-33cmH2O/L/s presented during a single inspiration. Data were collected for 100, 200 and 300 single breath trials. The results showed that the model fitted the data well; that 200 trials provided performance indices that were sufficiently precise to distinguish between relatively low, average and high levels of sensitivity; and that, for the modality tested, respiratory sensation complied with Weber&#8217;s Law. The second study applied the validated procedure to test the ability of 25 asthmatics classified either as severe, or mild or moderate, and 25 matched controls to distinguish between pairs of external resistive loads ranging from 2-33cmH2O/L/s presented during a single inspiration. Analysis of the data (ANOVA) showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of subjects to distinguish between resistive loads regardless of whether they were severe asthmatics with or without a history of SLTAs, mild or moderate asthmatics, or matched controls. It was concluded that asthmatics with poor sensitivity to the respiratory sensation tested and asthmatics most "at risk of death" from their asthma were not a homogeneous group, but poor sensitivity coupled with severe asthma, and a history of SLTAs most likely increased the risk of death to that patient. Four studies were conducted to meet the second aim. The first three studies were concerned with determining the reproducibilty of the scalp potential evoked by inspiratory occlusion (designated respiratory event related evoked potentials, RREP) and establishing a reliable recording protocol for the RREP that was relatively free of artefact. The results showed that the RREP was relatively stable over time and the best recording sites were cephalic electrode pairs C3-Cz and C4-Cz (10-20 International System). The fourth study examined the relationship between the ability of 25 asthmatic subjects and their matched controls to distinguish between levels of resistive loads added to inspiration and the latencies and amplitudes of the first positive and first negative components of the RREP. Correlation analysis showed that there was no relationship between sensitivity to added resistive loads during inspiration and RREP component parameters. It was concluded that diminution or absence of the early components of the RREP was not indicative of impaired perception of respiratory sensation though some issues regarding the appropriateness of the analysis still require resolution.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collagen fibres, force and intracellular calcium in rat cardiac trabeculae</field><field name="creator">Hanley, Peter John</field><field name="description">A thin cardiac muscle preparation of rat (ventricular trabeculae) was used in the two studies described in this Thesis. First, I investigated the mechanisms by which volatile anaesthetics decrease cardiac contractility using trabeculae loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Second, I employed confocal laser scanning microscopy to determine the three-dimensional microstructure of perimysial collagen fibres over the range of sarcomere lengths (1.9 - 2.3 &#181;m) in which passive force increases steeply. The volatile anaesthetics halothane (0.23 &#8211; 3 %) and isoflurane (0.48 - 4%) produced dose-dependent decreases in the amplitudes of the intracellular Ca2+ transients and twitch force. They also produced changes in cellular autofluorescence, consistent with an increase in the concentration of the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotides and flavoproteins. When the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator signals were corrected for changes in cellular autofluorescence, the volatile anaesthetics did not significantly change diastolic [Ca2+]. In the presence of halothane or isoflurane, restoration of Ca2+ transients to control levels, achieved by elevation of external [Ca2+], did not restore peak force. Moreover, maximal Ca2+-activated force, elicited using ryanodine tetani, was reduced by halothane and isoflurane. Thus, the negative inotropic actions of halothane and isoflurane in cardiac muscle reflect both reduced availability of Ca2+ and decreased responsiveness of the contractile system to Ca2+. Reconstructed three-dimensional images showed that perimysial collagen fibres are wavy (as distinct from coiled) cords which straighten considerably as sarcomere length is increased from ~1.85 &#181;m (near-resting length) to ~2.3 &#181;m. These observations are consistent with the notion that the straightening of these fibres is responsible for limiting cardiac sarcomere length to ~2.3 &#181;m.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the projections of the superior cerebellar peduncle and the rubrothalamic and nigrothalamic projections in the rat, and their relevance to the homologies of the anterior parts of the ventral nucleus of the thalamus in the mammalian brain</field><field name="creator">Faull, Richard Lewis Maxwell</field><field name="description">Since there has been no detailed study of the projections of the superior cerebellar peduncle (S.C.P.) with the most recently developed silver impregnation technique - the Fink-Heimer method - such a study has been carried out in the albino rat following complete unilateral destruction of the S.C.P. In order to assist with the interpretation of the thalamic terminations of the S.C.P., studies have also been made of the thalamic projections of the red nucleus and substantia nigra. The results are based on experiments in 56 animals: 22 for the investigation of the Projections of the S.C.P., 12 for the investigation of the rubrothalamic projections, and 22 for the investigation of the nigrothalamic projections. Oblique electrode approaches were devised which enabled the placement of discrete peduncular, rubral or nigral lesions with only the minimum of incidental damage to the surrounding Structures. The rubrothalamic projections were studied by the method of successive degeneration. The animals were generally killed after a survival period of 5 to 7 days and the axon degeneration was demonstrated with the Fink-Heimer silver impregnation technique. To analyse and record the experimental results, the patterns of degeneration were identified with the light microscope and meticulously plotted on diagrams of the brain using a projection system. To gain the fullest possible picture of the fibre projections, experimental material was analysed in coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes. The principal results of this investigation in the rat are as follows: (i) The confirmation of Ramon y Cajal&#8217;s (1903) original description that the fibres in the S.C.P. project caudally via ipsilateral and contralateral descending pathways to the pons and medulla and rostrally via a contralateral ascending pathway to the midbrain and diencephalon. (ii) The demonstration: (a) that the ipsilateral descending pathway terminates in the parvocellular reticular formation of the pons and medulla; (b) that the contralateral descending pathway terminates topically in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the pontine nuclei and the inferior olive, and also in the magnocellular nuclei of the reticular formation and the nucleus reticularis paramedianus;(c) that the contralateral ascending pathway terminates mainly in the red nucleus in the midbrain and throughout the Vm-V1 complex of the thalamus, and also in various other midbrain, subthalamic and thalamic nuclei. (iii) The demonstration: (a) that the cells of the red nucleus project to the Vm-Vl complex; (b) that the substantia nigra projects by a dorsal tegmental route to Vm and to adjacent parts of the V1 complex in the thalamus, and that the pars compacta of the substantia nigra projects to the striatum. (iv) The identification of the Vm-V1 complex as the homologue in the rat thalamus of the nuclei ventralis lateralis et anterior thalami of the higher primates on the basis of the distribution of cerebellar, rubral and nigral afferents to these nuclei.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential cancer preventative properties of sweetpotato anthocyanin-rich polyphenolic complex</field><field name="creator">Asadi, Khalid</field><field name="description">Anthocyanins are a widespread source of naturally occurring colorants distributed in fruits, vegetables, and beverages such as red wine.

Reproductive efficiency is a major component of this objective. With the use of cryopreserved semen and artificial insemination, bull fertility is a large factor in herd reproduction. General semen characteristics such as volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility and sperm morphology characteristics are classic methods of assessing fertility. For over 50 years, scientists have attempted to correlate normal sperm morphology with male fertility. Confounding reports as to this correlation may be due to the variability associated with the methods used to determine normal morphology. Due to subjectivity and variability, development of objective and consistent analysis methods receive considerable attention. One subjective method is computer assisted sperm head morphometry analysis (ASMA). Precise and objective sperm head size and shape can be quantified using ASMA. The objectives of this dissertation were to 1) develop processing and analysis methods for the accurate quantification of bull sperm heads, 2) assess the inherent instrument, sample and observer variability associated with the analysis of bull sperm heads and, ultimately, 3) quantify the effects of cryopreservation on bull sperm head size and shape and 4) determine the relationship of sperm-head morphometry and post-thaw fertility of cryopreserved bull semen. A standard semen sample dilution, sperm staining method and microscope magnification level improved the instrument performance in assessing bull sperm head morphometry. There were no significant replication or observer effects detected on sperm head measurements. The heads of bull spermatozoa did show a significant decrease in dimensions after cryopreservation, indicating an effect among all bulls. Furthermore, in a subsequent study, no significant differences between pre-freeze and post-thaw sperm head measurements of two groups of bulls with high and low non-return to oestrus rates were detected. However, the change in sperm head width/length pre-freeze and post-thaw was weakly correlated with the post-thaw fertility among bulls. These results indicate that when standard methods of sample preparation and analysis are used, ASMA is an objective method of analysing bull sperm head dimensions. Measurements provided by the ASMA system show that uniform results are acquired among different observers. A single analysis of one slide, analysing 100 sperm heads, provides precise information regarding the sample. Because sperm head dimensions are affected by cryopreservation, samples of fresh semen will have to be utilised in future studies to determine whether differences in sperm head morphometry are detectable between fertile and subfertile bulls and to quantify the dimensions of spermatozoa of fertile bulls. Furthermore, pre-freeze measurements of morphometry do not appear to be correlated with post-thaw fertility of cryopreserved bull semen, based on non-return to oestrus rates.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic expression patterns of major lens membrane proteins</field><field name="creator">Grey, Angus Cheverton</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of structure to function of the superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin A</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Keith R</field><field name="description">The relationship of structure to function in the superantigens of Staphylococcus aureus 1 Enterotoxins were isolated from expression in E. coli using the pGeX vector. Yields of up to 20 mg/litre of culture of purified toxin were achieved. 2 Recombinant SEA, SEB, SED and SEE produced by this system were identical to the wild type enterotoxins by several biological and biochemical criteria. 3 The unique T-cell receptor binding site of SEA and SEE was identified by the use of a panel of hybrids between these two toxins. Four different assays showed that the different V&#946; specificity of these toxins was determined by G200, S206 and N207 in SEA and at P206 and D207 in SEE. 4 Residues on both SEA and HLA-DR were identified that directly interact upon binding, thus defining the MHC class II binding site of SEA. The requirement of zinc for SEA binding to HLA-DR allowed the identification of the MHC class II binding site on SEA. This requirement was shown to be due to zinc bridging between these proteins. The zinc binding residues in SEA were demonstrated to be H187, H225 and D227. 5 Histidine 81 in the &#946;-chain of HLA-DR1 was shown to be the fourth residue in the tetravalent coordination of zinc. 6 This investigation in conjunction with the crystal structure of SEB and other mutational studies has collectively identified the T-cell receptor binding site of the enterotoxins. This study also located the MHC class II binding site of SEA and on the crystal structure of SEB the zinc coordinating residues cluster together, well separated from the T-cell receptor binding site. Thus proving that these superantigens cross link the T-cell receptor and MHC class II antigen. 7 The location of the zinc coordinating residues together with the crystal structures of SEB and HLA-DR1 allowed the construction of a structural model of how SEA binds to HLA-DR1. This model predicts that SEA binds across the end of the peptide groove and significantly that the orientation of the T-cell receptor in the recognition of the SEA-MHC class II complex is different to the orientation used to recognise peptide-MHC. This non conventional recognition of superantigen is compatible with the influence of polymorphism in both the T-cell receptor and MHC class II on superantigen recognition.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of metabolic insult on amino acids in the ciliary epithelium, lens, and retina</field><field name="creator">Hu, Guo Min</field><field name="description">Ischaemic insult deprives ocular tissue of oxygen and essential metabolites leading to anatomical and functional changes. One way to gauge the effect of ocular ischaemia is to determine changes in amino acids likely to be modified due to the intricate interrelationship between cellular metabolism and these compounds. Such an approach, using quantitative silver-intensified immunogold detection of a range of immunoglobulins, can provide a metabolic profile of cells (metabolome). Despite the known alterations in the ciliary epithelium and lens function secondary to ocular ischaemia, little is know about the metabolic profile in both normal ocular tissue and in ocular tissue exposed to metabolic insult. The major goal of this thesis was to investigate the metabolome of the ciliary epithelium and lens under normal and ischaemic conditions, in parallel to that of the retina, with complete spatial and single cell resolution. The results showed that a glutamate/glutamine cycle exists between the ciliary epithelium and lens, in analogy to the metabolic relationship between neurons and glia in the retina. with the localisation of glutamine synthetase and glutamate transporters, amino acids including glutamate and glutamine accumulate in the ciliary epithelium for secretion, so that lens amino acid levels can be sustained. Experimental manipulations reported in this thesis include enzyme inhibition and exposure to acute ischaemia, both leading to fluctuations of the amino acid levels/distributions in the ciliary epithelium and retina, and changes in amino acids associated with cellular metabolism. In the ischaemia/reperfusion experiments, despite recovery of anatomical features, there were persistent metabolic changes in the ciliary epithelium after four days reperfusion, which results in lower amino acids both in the ciliary epithelium and lens. Further, studies of glutamate transporters led to the discovery of a unique mechanism of glutamate release involving the cystine-glutamate transporter at the photoreceptor ribbon complex. In conclusion, the results offer a parsimonious explanation for the common association of altered ciliary body function and cataract secondary to ischaemic insult and provide evidence for highly conserved amino acid metabolic pathways within ocular tissues.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320900 Optometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Polynesians</field><field name="creator">Abbott, William</field><field name="description">Genetic differences between Polynesians and Europeans may contribute to the many differences in disease frequency that occur between these races. This thesis describes studies that were designed to determine if genetic influences contribute to the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Polynesians. Alleles suitable for gene flow measurements were identified and used to find associations between European genes and indices of chronic HBV infection in Polynesians. An ecologic study found a negative association between European genes and the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in five Polynesian ethnic groups (p&lt;0.05). In a case control study, there was a positive correlation (r=0.90, p=0.04) between the percent of European genes in a Polynesian ethnic group and the difference in the percent of European genes between the HBV carriers and the anti-HBs positive controls in that ethnic group. Thus, the possibility that genetic factors are a major cause of the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Polynesians cannot be excluded. A twin study or candidate gene studies will be necessary to take this work further. We attempted to identify candidate genes in the Tcr &#946; chain variable region (V &#946;)locus that might contain polymorphisms that influence the human in vivo immune response to the HBV. V&#946;7.4 was associated with the immune response to a vaccine containing recombinant HBsAg in two separate studies (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.05). The frequency of.V&#946;7.4 was low in the cord blood of neonates born to HBsAg positive mothers (p=0.001). The frequency of V&#946;5.1 was high in the cord blood of neonates of HBeAg positive mothers (p&lt;0.001). Thus the V&#946;7.4 and V&#946;5.1 genes may be preferentially used in the human immune response to the HBV and may be an appropriate place to seek polymorphisms that influence the immune response to the HBV and susceptibility to a chronic HBV infection.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic chondron function in articular cartilage</field><field name="creator">Hing, Wayne Anthony</field><field name="description">This study examined the behaviour of articular cartilage chondrocytes and the role of the pericellular microenvironment in modifying cellular behaviour during dynamic loading events. While the structural composition and metabolic function of the chondron have been examined previously, little is known about its physiology. Consequently, it was hypothesised that 'the chondrocyte behaves dynamically within the chondron microenvironment, and that the microenvironment plays a critical role in minimising the volume regulatory activity required to maintain the health of the chondrocyte throughout the physicochemical changes associated with the loading cycle.&#8217; Four research objectives addressed the hypothesis. The first was to develop an environmental perfusion chamber and experimental protocols for dynamic imaging of articular chondrocytes in vitro and ex vivo using time-lapse video microscopy. The system developed, which was composed of a chamber and unique complimentary heating system, enabled temperature control, media perfusion and variable delivery of environmental factors, over long imaging periods without fluctuations in focus or loss of cell viability. Secondly was to examine short and long term behaviour of chondrocytes cultured in agarose gel, alginate beads and vibratome prepared explants. The results showed dynamic activity of cytoplasmic organelles, constant changes in position of the chondrocyte within the microenvironment and cellular secretory events that influenced its organisation. Unique information regarding these biological responses will be vital for future research. Thirdly was to examine the role of the microenvironment and its territorial and interterritorial matrices in volume regulation of intact tissue. The microenvironment occupies a critical position between the bulk of the cartilage matrix involved in load bearing deformation and physical changes and the chondrocyte, which attempts to minimise its volume regulatory response while maintaining active metabolic management of the matrices. Fourthly was to examine the role of the microenvironment in volume regulation isolated chondrocytes. Its robust structure appears responsible for physical and chemical protection of the chondrocyte. This study provided the first evidence that the microenvironment can influence the volume regulatory response of the chondrocyte. The composition and integrity of the microenvironment influence the ability of the chondrocyte to respond to osmotic challenge and the intact microenvironment functions efficiently in vivo to minimize the exposure of the chondrocyte to dynamic osmotic challenges that could compromise function.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the nexus of loneliness, stigma, health complaints, and primary medical care in older New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Hector-Taylor, Loma Helen</field><field name="description">The nexus or linkages between loneliness, stigma, health complaints, and primary medical care in older New Zealanders was explored from a social constructionist perspective. The intent of the studies was the support and explanation of the underlying arguments of the thesis. For this age group loneliness is a clinical condition which merits greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment from general practitioners than it presently receives. As a society we silence and stigmatise loneliness in our senior citizens making it likely that they will present indirectly to their doctors when experiencing severe effects of the condition. This behaviour will increase their risk of inappropriate medical intervention at possible cost to themselves and to society. A cross sectional, randomly selected survey of 300 New Zealanders over 60 years old, aimed to establish the patterns of loneliness in the sample using quantitative analysis. The second qualitative study used the methodology of discourse analysis to identify the themes concerning loneliness and medical care in the accounts of older adults, and how these were used. Fourteen people, deemed by their doctors to be lonely and to need frequent medical care, were interviewed in order to further knowledge of the dynamics of loneliness and the medical encounter. Fifteen percent of the sample of 300 had moderate to severe loneliness scores. The sociodemographic indicators of loneliness were extremely easy for a practitioner to recognize. Less than 2% of the total of self reported doctor visits were explicitly for loneliness. According to Barsky's (1981) model, the most likely pathways to the doctor were through symptom amplification and lowered self ratings of health, with a less likely pathway through focusing on and worrying about symptoms, leading to perceived need for medical care. The predictive variances in regressions of loneliness on all health outcomes, except for self reported visiting of more than one doctor for symptoms, were lower for chronic than for situational loneliness. The most important conclusions from the second study were the identification of three rhetorical strategies or "etcetera clauses" which provided a social prescription for the indirect presentation of loneliness by older people. Loneliness may be discussed with the doctor; if it affects your physical health; if you are consulting for another reason; and if the doctor picks it up. Also, the individual doctor defines loneliness as a worthy, or non-worthy, condition for consultation.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child Immunisation: reactions and responses to New Zealand government policy 1920-1990</field><field name="creator">Day, Alison Suzanne</field><field name="description">My thesis has explored the history of child immunisation in New Zealand from a socio-medical perspective. The framework has been hinged around the actions and immunisation strategies of the Health Department over the period 1920 to 1990 and the responses of parents to those actions and strategies. One of the most important concepts considered was how the Health Department decided on and then implemented immunisation policy during the period. Health professionals played a significant role in the delivery of immunisation to children and have impacted on a number of policy changes. After World War Two, with an increase in the number of vaccines on offer, the specialised expertise of the World Health Organization and the Epidemiology Advisory Committee in policy determination became very influential. The responses to departmental immunisation policies by parents demonstrated a significant change during the period, although most apparent in the 1980s. From a situation of wariness (and perhaps indifference) in the 1920s and 1930s to almost total vaccine acceptance from the 1950s, the 1980s were, by contrast, illustrative of parental assertiveness especially concerning side-effects. The advent of feminism in the 1970s and the issues of informed consent in the mid-1980s assisted in raising levels of parental awareness in immunisation which continued into the 1990s. Ethnic and socio-economic background also contributed to different levels of acceptance of immunisation, which will be addressed. Opposition to immunisation tended to wax and wane during this period. Two groups were dominant, although at opposite ends of the time spectrum. Both were small but vocal in their views. Nevertheless, neither group made much impression on New Zealand parents, although they were both an irritant to the Health Department. Overseas experiences in immunisation were interwoven throughout my thesis to set the New Zealand events in an international context. The introduction of a particular vaccine was compared and contrasted with similar schemes elsewhere to give an appreciable understanding of New Zealand&#8217;s position. Vaccine controversies overseas were also examined to determine their influence in New Zealand. Immunisation policy has been shaped by a myriad of factors and influences from both inside and outside the country. There were extensive changes over the years in the way parents, health professionals and the Health Department perceived immunisation which will be examined in my thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental manipulation of fetal growth</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Francis Harry</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis investigated the effects of low doses of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I on fetal growth and metabolism in normally growing and growth-restricted (IUGR) late-gestation ovine fetuses. Intra-amniotic and intravenous routes of administration were studied. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the effects of daily intra-amniotic injections of IGF-I for l0 days to fetuses with IUGR induced by placental embolisation. Embolisation produced asymmetrical IUGR with moderately severe effects on the gut. Gut weight, gut wall thickness and crypt mitoses were reduced. Villus enterocytes in the ileum contained numerous vacuoles, suggesting either functional adaptation or delayed maturation. IGF-I treatment increased amniotic fluid IGF-I concentrations 5-fold, but decreased plasma concentrations. The effects of embolisation on the gut were reversed, except for the enterocyte vacuolation in the ileum which was more pronounced with IGF-I treatment. Fetal gut uptake of glutamine from the circulation was reduced in IGF-I treated animals, but uptake from amniotic fluid may have increased. Fetal liver and spleen size were reduced. The distribution of placentome types was also altered with IGF-I treatment. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate the clearance of 125I-IGF-I from amniotic fluid. The half-life of 125I-IGF-I in amniotic fluid was 24 hours. Significant amounts of 125I-IGF-I remained unbound for up to 144 hours in both amniotic fluid and plasma. The predominant binding protein in amniotic fluid was IGFBP-3, and the proportion of 125I-IGF-I that was bound in amniotic fluid was strongly correlated with relative levels of IGFBP-3. Uptake of intact 125I-IGF-I across the fetal gut was clearly demonstrated, and continued for at least 36 hours following injection. A preliminary pharmacokinetic model of intra-amniotic dosing with IGF-I is presented. The aim of the final experiment was to investigate the effects of a chronic intravenous infusion of a low dose of IGF-I to normally growing late-gestation fetuses. There were no effects of IGF-I treatment on fetal growth or metabolism. Five fetuses were found to be IUGR at post mortem due to the effects of facial eczema in the ewe. A post hoc analysis of the effects of intravenous IGF-I in IUGR fetuses was therefore performed. IGF-I treatment significantly increased growth rate of IUGR fetuses and increased fetal blood aminonitrogen levels. Mean placentome weight was increased and the distribution of placentome types was altered. IGF-I treatment of IUGR fetuses reduced fetal lactate production. There were no differences in measures of fetal body or organ size at post mortem. The data from these investigations into the experimental manipulation of fetal growth provide clear evidence of the reversal of some of the effects of established IUGR, demonstrate uptake of intact and free IGF-I across the fetal gut, and, for the first time, suggest that IGF-I may increase the rate of fetal growth in IUGR. Amniotic fluid is the most readily accessible fetal compartment. The experiments described in this thesis suggest that fetal supplementation with IGF-I via the amniotic route may be a feasible, efficacious and clinically applicable therapeutic stratagem for the IUGR fetus.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of proteins in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland</field><field name="creator">Evans, John Jerram</field><field name="description">Ovine neurophysin was extracted from fresh-frozen whole pituitary glands using hydrochloric acid at pH 1.2-1.6. After salt precipitation neurophysin was separated from other extracted protein by gel-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G.75. Ion exchange chromatography on CM-sephadex C.50 using acetate buffer in a pH gradient was employed to resolve the neurophysin fraction into three components. Contamination of the preparations by non-neurohypophysial hormones was investigated. Antibodies which were raised in rabbits against ovine and porcine neurophysin were observed to have reactivity with neurophysins of the same and different species as the source of the antigen. Soluble proteins in the neural lobes of a number of mammals were separated by electrophoresis on starch-gel and tested, by immunodiffusion, for immunological reactivity with an anti-porcine neurophysin-II serum. A number of proteins, sometimes more than three per animal, reacted positively with the antiserum. Immunofluorescence histochemistry was used to demonstrate neurophysin-like antigen in tissue slices. Initially tissue was frozen unfixed and sectioned in a cryostat prior to fixation in 95% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. subsequently an improved method was developed in which tissues were fixed in saline-formalin and embedded in paraffin and immunohistochemistry carried out on deparaffinised sections. Immunofluorescence on tissue fixed in saline formalin was more intense and cells were resolved more sharply than on slices of fresh-frozen tissue. Neurophysin antigen was observed in the magnocellular nuclei of adult rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits and also in accessory cell groups in the hypothalamus. Material reactive against anti-neurophysin sera was also present in the neurohypophysis. Furthermore, neurophysin-like material was demonstrated in axons of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial fibre tracts, especially in guinea-pig tissue slices. Immunoreactive material in axons was more abundant in tissue from dehydrated guinea-pigs. Neurophysin-like antigen, as detected by immunodiffusion and immunofluorescence was depleted in the neural lobes of dehydrated rate. Staining by aldehyde fuchsin showed that dehydration also caused a reduction in neurosecretory material in rat neurohypophyses. In the guinea-pig neurohypophysis, neurosecretory material was observed to have a lobular distribution whereas immunofluorescence was lobular on frozen sections but of even intensity on paraffin sections. Dehydration caused a depletion of histochemically-detected material in the guinea-pig neural lobe. Immunofluorescence histochemistry enabled detection of neurophysin antigen in rat hypothalami at 17 days gestational age. Fetal calves of 130 days and rabbits of 29 days gestation were also seen to have immunoreactive material in the hypothalamus and neural lobe. Evidence for modification of neurophysin-like material in the perikaryon or in proximal parts of the axona of the guinea-pig hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system was obtained by observing the effects of different treatments of HNS tissue blocks and slices on histological stains.

The overall goal of the project was to provide information likely to improve the health and wellbeing of young people and thereby contribute, in the long term, to a reduction in youth suicide. This project, which was undertaken by Ms Coggan over a period of 26 months, involved collaboration with the Mental Health Foundation, and included the participation of community groups and young people. While several community-based strategies to address youth suicide were developed and implemented as part of this project, only three were central components of the Youth Suicide Prevention Project. The first strategy involved the use of a questionnaire designed to obtain information on the range and level of risk-taking behaviours occurring among young people and their perceptions of health-harming activities. The information obtained both assisted a local community to develop strategies to enhance the health and wellbeing of its young people and provided information to policy-makers on the extent of risk-taking behaviour and its association with self-harm. The second community-based strategy was the development and trialing of a teaching resource for use in forms three and four. This resource (Mental Health Matters) was designed to provide students with an opportunity to acquire information and skills to better promote and protect their mental health. The final strategy involved the conduct of a community action programme focused exclusively on youth health. Included in this programme was the provision and dissemination of local information on youth health and the conduct of three workshops: i) developing a mentally healthy school; ii) improving the identification, referral and acute management of suicidal young people; and iii) a community activation workshop designed to allow a community to prioritise strategies to improve youth health. Four aspects of formative input to the Youth Suicide Prevention Project are reported in this thesis: the developmental phase, the Youth Health and Risk-taking Survey, the Mental Health Matters programme, and the Youth Health Community Action Programme. This has involved the review of literature; the use of archival data and records; attendance at meetings; participant observation; the identification of evaluation procedures and methods; the design of data collection techniques; qualitative and quantitative data analyses including consultation with a statistician; and report preparation and timely dissemination both to the participants and to the wider community. The main findings of this evaluation indicated: that adopting a range of 15-24 years for youth was not realistic; that the occurrence of youth suicide and attempted suicide was spread evenly within the North Health region; that young people and school personnel saw a need for health promotion strategies to be developed; that young people identified a need for information on how to help themselves and others in times of crisis; that young people at school would provide information on a range of risk-taking activities; that high levels of risk-taking were occurring among young people at school; that an association exists between certain risk-taking behaviour and self-harm; that the provision of local information on youth risk-taking behaviour could act as a stimulus for the development of community-based strategies to address these; that a curriculum based programme with a positive focus on mental health should, with modification, be implemented nationally; that there is a need for the wider community to have information to dispel the myths surrounding suicide and suicide ideation; and that it is possible to successfully conduct a community action project exclusively focused on the health needs of young people. Major implications identified for future projects were the importance of providing relevant and local data to enable a community to develop strategies to address youth health issues and the need to further examine the high levels of risk-taking behaviours and the association of risk-taking behaviour and self-harm. This project also showed that teachers and students supported the further development of a curriculum-based programme called Mental Health Matters. This project also highlighted the need for an ongoing process of interaction between the community and research-based knowledge to ensure that strategies, proposed by the community are able so be implemented. Finally, while there is a need to focus on youth at risk, this thesis has demonstrated a need to provide the wider community with information and resources to dispel all the myths that surround suicide and suicide ideation.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radar/Gdf6a function during zebrafish (Danio rerio)embryogenesis</field><field name="creator">Hall, Christopher James</field><field name="description">In the early vertebrate embryo, the vascular system is one of the first organ systems to form. Recently it has become evident that the development of mature, functional vessels requires not only signals derived from the endothelium itself, but a set of additional molecules that are not necessarily endothelium-specific. In zebrafish and Xenopus embryos two such tissues that are believed to secrete modulators of blood vessel assembly are the hypochord and primitive gut endoderm (PGE). These tissues intimately border the major axial vasculature. Radar/Growth/differentiation factor 6a (Gdf6a) represents a signalling molecule belonging to the GDF5, 6, 7 subgroup of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) superfamily. In the zebrafish, transcripts for radar are located in the hypochord, PGE and ventral tail mesenchyme (VTM), all tissues that border the developing axial blood vessels. This prompted an investigation into a potential role for this signalling bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) during the specification and assembly of the closely related vascular and haematopoietic systems in the zebrafish. Transient forced expression experiments confirmed an early ventralising activity for the Radar signal that resulted in the expansion of the haematopoietic/vascular compartment, known as the intermediate cell mass (ICM). However, a loss-of-function zebrafish model generated using morpholino technology demonstrated a critical requirement for this BMP signal in establishing the integrity of the axial blood vessels. Furthermore, this requirement was independent of the initial establishment of vascular patterning. Zebrafish embryos depleted of the Radar signal initiate a normal primitive circulation. However, soon after this commencement of normal flow, blood cells were observed to extravasate from the axial vasculature. Microangiography confirmed this leakage phenotype. Such an angiogenic/maturation role for Radar during vascular development was supported by a transgenic zebrafish line carrying an inducible copy of the radar gene. Homozygous transgenic embryos established a typical early circulation that became progressively restricted until no blood travelled throughout the entire embryonic tissue. In summary, the work presented in this thesis strongly suggests that Radar is involved in a signalling pathway required for establishing the integrity of the axial vessels during zebrafish development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renal blood flow in the conscious, unrestrained rat</field><field name="creator">Grady, Heather</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the rate of renal blood flow remains constant under normal physiological conditions. Methods were developed for long term studies of renal blood flow (using the Doppler flow probe) and blood pressure in the conscious unrestrained rat. Special care was taken to maintain and observe the rats under normal, physiological conditions. Since the Doppler flow probe measures blood velocity rather than flow, changes in renal arterial diameter will alter the output of the flow meter, even if flow is constant. In order to measure flow more accurately, chanqes in vessel diameter were prevented by a short length of silastic tubing inserted into the renal, ortery under the probe. Blood flow was expressed as a percentage of the maximal flow measured when the animal was completely relaxed. Using this preparation, renal blood flow was measured continuously under normal conditions in both the light and dark cycles. Studies were performed to assess the effects on renal blood flow of anaesthesia, surgery and stress, and to assess the effect on renal blood flow of blockade of the renal nerves. Renal blood flow was depressed approximately 50% by anaesthesia, due to the effects of the anaesthetic agent rather than the accompanying surgery. Renal blood flow did not fully recover for 3-4 days after anaesthesia with, or without surgery. Renal blood flow was depressed by stress, even though blood pressure was unchanged. A mild sudden auditory disturbance caused a transient 23% fall in renal blood flow. A continuous auditory disturbance, depressed renal blood flow by 16% for several minutes. Handling the rat resulted in a 33% fall in renal blood flow which lasted for over 30 minutes. When measured continuously, renal blood flow was found to vary considerably. When the rat was completely relaxed renal blood flow was highest (defined as 100%). Renal blood flow remained high when eating and drinking (79%), but fell when the rat became alert but completely still (74%). During general movement renal blood flow was low (73%) with flow lowest while grooming (64%). Flow was apparently related to the degree of alertness and to activity. The extent of variation of flow is such that the calculated mean daily value of renal blood flow was only 80% of the maximum flow observed during complete relaxation. The depression of renal blood flow seen during activity and disturbance was largely prevented during reversible blockade of the ipsilateral renal nerve, induced by slow infusion of xylocaine around the renal artery. It was completely abolished by bilateral renal nerve blockade with Xylocaine. The depressive effects of activity and disturbance on renal blood flow were restored an hour after the Xylocaine infusion ceased. These studies clearly show that renal nerve is involved in control of renal blood flow under physiological conditions. It is clear that renal blood flow varies markedly under normal physiological conditions and in response to the external environment. A constant renal blood flow is not a necessity for normal renal function.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honey and venous leg ulceration: a systematic review &amp; randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Jull, Andrew</field><field name="description">Aims: To investigate the effect of honey on wound healing by conducting [1] a systematic review of trials of honey in wound care and [2] a randomised controlled trial of honey-impregnated dressings for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (the HALT trial). Systematic review: Method - The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, AMED and LILACS were searched for controlled trials using honey for any type of patient with an acute or chronic wound. Honey manufacturers and researchers were contacted, citations scrutinised and the internet searched. Data from included studies were combined where studies were sufficiently alike. Findings - 18 trials were included. Honey significantly decreased healing time compared to conventional dressings for partial thickness burns (WMD -4.7 days, 95%Cl -5.1 to -4.3), but delayed healing time in comparison to early excision and skin grafting for mixed partial and deep thickness burns (WMD 25 days, 95%Cl 17.4 to 32.6). No significant effect was found for minor acute wounds or for honey compared to silver sulfadiazine in partial thickness burns. There were no trials of honey for treating venous leg ulcers. Randomised controlled trial: Method - The HALT trial was a pragmatic, open label randomised trial. Participants received either a manuka honey-impregnated calcium alginate dressing (n=187) or usual care (n=181) for 12weeks. Both groups received compression bandaging. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with healed ulcers at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, change in ulcer area, incidence of infection, adverse events, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Findings -104 participants in the honey-treated (55.6%) group and 90 (49.7%) in the usual care group healed at 12 weeks (absolute increase 5.9%, 95%Cl -4.3% to 15.7%, p=0.3). Time to healing was not significantly different between the groups (mean difference -1.8 days, 95%Cl -7.7 to 4.1, p=0.5), nor was change in ulcer area (mean difference 0.9cm2, 95%Cl -1.4cm2 to 3.2cm2, p=0.4)incidence of infection (absolute decrease 5.0%, 95%Cl -3.1% to 13.1%, p=0.2), ulcer recurrence (absolute increase 5.2%, 95%Cl -0.4% to 10.7%, p=0.1), or quality of life. The average cost of community-based treatment per participant was higher in the honey-treated group (NZ$862 versus NZ$795). More adverse events were reported in the honey-treated group (RR 1.3, 95%Cl 1.1 to 1.6, p=0.01). More participants reported pain as an adverse event when treated with honey (RR 2.5, 95%Cl 1.5 to 4.2, p=0.0001). Interpretation: Systematic review - Honey may be an effective treatment for partial thickness burns in comparison to conventional dressings. Honey does not appear to benefit healing in other acute wounds and may delay healing in mixed and partial thickness burns compared to excision and grafting. The HALT trial - Honey-impregnated dressings did not have any significant positive effect on venous ulcer healing and were more expensive than usual care. Participants treated with honey experienced more pain than control participants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterisation and evolution of zebrafish (Danio rerio) bmp9, bmp10 and gdf11</field><field name="creator">Bland, Ross James</field><field name="description">Three members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, bmp9, bmp10 and gdf11 were isolated from zebrafish genomic and cDNA libraries to further elucidate the role of these genes during embryogenesis. Zebrafish bmp9 and bmp10 belong to the BMP9/10 subfamily. The level of sequence similarity between the zebrafish and mammalian BMP9/10 subfamily members prompted an investigation into the evolutionary relationships of the zebrafish genes. The orthology of bmp9 and bmp10 were examined by phylogenetic and syntenic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis grouped bmp9, DSLI, Bmp9 and BMP9 into a single clade and bmp10, Bmp10 and BMP10 into another. Zebrafish bmp9 and human BMP9 were mapped to linkage group 12 and chromosome 17, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with a number of other genes mapped onto these respective chromosomes. Zebrafish bmp10 and human BMP10 were mapped to linkage group 5 and chromosome 2, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with mcm6/MCM6 and pax8/PAX8. The phylogenetic and syntenic analyses support the orthology of bmp9 and bmp10 to human BMP9 and BMP10, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis also suggests that chick DSL1 is not a unique member of the TGF&#946; superfamily but is the chicken ortholog of BMP9/Bmp9. The expression patterns of bmp9 and bmp10 were analysed by RT-PCR, Northern analysis, and by whole mount in situ hybridisation. No specific expression pattern was detected for either bmp9 or bmp10 by whole mount in situ hybridisation, indicating the low expression levels of these genes. The lower than expected sequence similarity to the mammalian orthologs and the low level of expression suggest a lack of evolutionary pressure between subfamily members. Zebrafish Gdf11 shows a high level of amino acid identity over the length of the entire protein to mouse GDF11. Phylogenetic analysis grouped gdf11, Gdf11 and GDF11 into a single clade. Zebrafish gdf11 and human GDF11 were mapped to linkage group 11 and chromosome 12, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with atp5b/ATP5b, dspg3/DSPG3, hoxcb/HOXC, and plasticin/PRPH on LG11/Hsa12. The phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, therefore, support the orthology of gdf11 to human GDF11. The expression pattern of gdf11 was analysed by whole mount in situ hybridisation. Expression of gdf11 was detected in both the dorsal and vegetal tail bud progenitors and during segmentation stages, expression becomes restricted to the caudal-most chordamesoderm of the tail bud. During the pharyngula stage, dynamic expression of gdf11 was detected in neural structures including the ventral hindbrain, midbrain and the forebrain. Expression of gdf11 was absent in the tail bud of ntlb195 mutant embryos but present in neural structures, indicating that the expression of gdf11 is regulated by different factors in these tissues. The function of gdf11 was analysed by microinjection of synthetic gdf11 mRNA. Overexpression of gdf11, however, resulted in the severe dorsalisation of the embryo, probably due to activation of a Nodal specific pathway.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microglial activation and inhibition: implications for neurodegeneration</field><field name="creator">Gibbons, Hannah Mary</field><field name="description">Accumulating evidence over the past 20 years has indicated that the brain has an endogenous immune system, mediated at the local level predominantly by microglial cells. The primary role of an inflammatory response is to protect the host against a foreign stimulus, remove damaged cells and to initiate repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. However, it has become increasingly evident that this inflammatory response, in addition to its role in host defence and repair, can exert detrimental effects in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation, as this response is now commonly known, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, the resident macrophage of the brain, play a central role in sustaining this inflammatory response through the release of proinflammatory and potentially cytotoxic mediators. Hypothermia is neuroprotective, and these properties are thought to be mediated, in part, by the suppression of microglial activation. The BV-2 microglial cell line was used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the activation and inhibition of microglia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of BV-2 cells led to the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the release of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin (PG)-E2, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, and a change to a phagocytic phenotype. This response was mediated by the initiation of signal transduction pathways that culminated in transcription and translation of the inflammatory genes. Hypothermia (33&#176;C) caused complete suppression of iNOS and NO whilst displaying little or no effect on IL-6 and TNF-&#945; respectively. In contrast, LPS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release was super-induced in response to hypothermia. A co-culture model of neuroinflammation was developed to investigate microglial-neuronal interactions. LPS/interferon (IFN)-&#947; activated BV-2 cells required direct contact with SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells to elicit a cytotoxic phenotype. Hypothermia and the selective iNOS inhibitor S-methylisothiourea (S-MT) protected against this BV-2-induced SK-N-SH cell death, strongly implicating NO as the major candidate molecule in microglial-induced neuronal cell death. Thus, microglial activation sustains the chronic inflammatory response in the CNS and in doing so contributes to further neuronal death. Inhibition of the detrimental facets of microglial activation may provide some protection against neurodegeneration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins in post-natal ruminants</field><field name="creator">Hodgkinson, Steven Charles</field><field name="description">Observations that IGF is produced and acts locally in multiple tissues raise important questions about the biological significance of the major pool of IGF present in the circulation. Does it represent a pool of endocrine IGF en route to the tissues or conversely growth factor produced in excess of autocrine/paracrine requirements undergoing elimination? The primary objective of this thesis was to examine the kinetics and distribution of circulating IGF in sheep with a view to determining tissue destinations and thereby potential functions of the blood borne hormone. The IGFBP play a central role in facilitating IGF action. Characterization studies of the IGFBP and an examination of their physiology and potential involvement in IGF transport are also important parts of this thesis. Such studies are necessary because potential therapeutic uses of IGF will depend on systemic administration and endocrine action. Early work involved structural/functional characterization of a batch of recombinant methionyl insulin-like growth factor-I (N-Met IGF-I) designated for this project. The peptide was heterogenous on reversed phase chromatography eluting as two major peaks of approximate abundance 1:2. These each had the amino acid constitution expected of N-Met IGF-I and were carefully characterized in a range of binding and biological assays. Whereas the early eluting peptide demonstrated much reduced activity in each assay system, the second peak proved equipotent to a highly purified ovine plasma IGF-I preparation and was chosen for the investigative work of this thesis. The early eluting peptide may represent a variant with mismatched disulphides. Initial characterization of IGF binding activity in ovine tissue fluids was performed by competitive IGF tracer binding techniques together with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and IGF-I affinity chromatography. Binding proteins (BP) of &gt;200, 150 and 40-50 kDa were revealed in these studies and shown to be widely distributed in body fluids. Thus the &gt;200 kDa binding protein, which is IGF-II specific, was identified in adult sheep plasma, colostrum, follicular fluid and fetal sheep plasma, and may be the ovine equivalent of the soluble type 2 IGF receptor. A 150 kDa binding protein complex, of mixed specificity for IGF-I and II, was also identified. In addition to vascular fluids, the 150 kDa complex was identified in mammay lymph, follicular fluid and, as a minor component, in vitreous humor. Binding proteins of 40-50 kDa were revealed in every fluid tested and multiple variants identified with distinct specificities for the IGF peptides. The BP 'make-up' of fluids and of 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa pools isolated by preliminary SEC was latter examined by IGF ligand blot analysis. Analysis of plasma 150 kDa pools revealed only the characteristic doublet of IGFBP-3 at 40-43 kDa, whereas the 40-50 kDa pool was heterogeneous containing IGFBP-3 together with smaller bands of 35, 30 and 23 kDa which may be the ovine equivalents of IGFBP-2, BP-4 and possibly BP-1. In support of the tracer binding data, IGFBP-3 was also identified in mammary lymph as were the smaller species. In an extension of the in vitro IGF tracer binding/SEC approach, kinetics of IGF equilibration with plasma binding sites was examined. Binding was found to be time and temperature dependent, reversible, dose responsive and relatively specific for the IGF peptides. Observations of special interest include a biphasic pattern of IGF-I equilibration with plasma, consistent with formation of the ternary 150 kDa complex of IGFBP-3, IGF and ALS, and evidence of relatively slow dissociation of IGF/BP complexes, suggesting that if release of IGF is required for full expression of IGF bioactivity in vivo, then specific processes may be involved. Avidity of isolated IGFBP complexes for Con A and heparin affinity adsorbents was also examined. The data indicate that the IGFBP belong to a relatively select group of proteins with high affinity for the glycosaminoglycan heparin suggesting roles for these proteins at the level of the capillary endothelium and/or extra-cellular matrix. Metabolic clearance of IGF-I and II was examined following intravenous (iv) bolus injection of the growth factors as radioiodinated tracer preparations. Tracer administration was followed by a rapid initial phase of clearance associated with tracer mixing in the vascular pool followed by intermediate and longer phases which appear to be direct consequences of interaction with and between the BP and to some extent accumulation of tracer degradation products in the circulation. Metabolic clearance of tracer complexed to the major molecular weight pools of BP was examined following SEC of sequential plasma samples. Average half-lives for IGF-I and II complexed to the 150 KDa and 40-50 kDa pools of carrier protein were established (150 kDa; 545&#177;25 min, 325&#177;30 min; 40-50 kDa, 34&#177;2 min, 9.6&#177;1.8 min, (mean&#177;S.E.M., IGF-I and II respectively)) and compared to free IGF-I (t1/2 &lt;5 min). Rapid clearance of free compared to bound IGF illustrates the central role of the IGFBP in maintaining IGF in the circulation and controlling tissue distribution. Whereas binding of IGF-II to different BP at 40-50 kDa (eg. IGFBP-2) may explain its shorter half-life compared with IGF-I, evidence suggests that IGF-I and II bind to the same carrier at 150 kDa. The observed difference in half-life of the 150 kDa complex is therefore suggestive of different metabolic handling of the BP depending on which of the IGFs is bound. The more rapid clearance of IGF-II complexed to the 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa carriers compared to IGf-I contributed to a more rapid clearance overall and is reflected in calculated metabolic clearance rates for IGF-I and II (IGF-I, 3.9 ml/min; IGF-II, 7.8 ml/min). Considering plasma IGF-II is significantly higher than IGF-I in post-natal sheep, a substantially greater secretion rate for IGF-II would be required to maintain plasma IGF-II in the face of the greater clearance rate. The secretion rate for IGF-II was estimated at ~ 1.6 nmol/min in the current study, some 8-fold greater than IGF-I. Clearance of IGF-I from plasma was associated with the appearance of radioactivity in lymph. Chromatography indicated that tracer in lymph was not degraded but retained its BP activity eluting on SEC complexed to high molecular weight BP. The data illustrate that blood borne IGF is distributed into the extra vascular space and may therefore be available to the tissues. This contention is supported by observations that relatively little radioactivity (&lt;20% in the course of these experiments) was cleared from plasma into urine suggesting that plasma IGF is not principally an elimination form. Similarly no other significant sites of elimination were identified. Questions of how physiological control of the BP may influence tissue distribution of IGF were investigated in the next major experimental section of this thesis. In the first study the influence of nutritional manipulation and GH treatment of growing lambs on the molecular distribution of IGF immunoreactivity in plasma was examined using a new IGF-I RIA in conjunction with SEC and saturation analysis for the estimation of the BP. Total plasma IGF-I was found to increase with nutritional intake (P&lt;0.01) and with GH treatment (0.25 mg/kg body weight/d; P&lt;0.001) but only on the higher intakes. Molecular size fractionation revealed IGF-I immunoreactivity in 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa binding fractions. 150 kDa bound IGF-I was increased on the higher plane of nutrition(P&lt;0.05) and by GH treatment (P&lt;0.001) but again, only at higher levels of nutrition. By contrast no change in 40-50 kDa bound IGF-I was observed with treatment. Unbound IGF-I was also identified in sheep plasma (2-5% of total) but demonstrated only slight changes in relation to treatment. Saturation analysis was an analytical approach chosen to estimate total binding capacity (TBC) and relative saturation of the binding protein pools. Evidence suggests that in ovine plasma constituents of the 150 kDa complex are available in excess of endogenous IGF (P&lt;0.001). Relative saturation of this species did not change with treatment despite the observed differences in 150 kDa bound IGF-I. The data suggest that components of the 150 kDa complex were themselves responsive to treatment. By contrast large differences in saturation of the 40-50 kDa species were observed (P&lt;0.001) despite little treatment dependent change in bound IGF-I. Binding capacity of the 40-50 kDa fraction was elevated at low levels of nutrition and suppressed on the higher feed intake resulting in near saturation. The data indicate complex regulation of the IGFBP in sheep. IGF-I, elevated in response to higher nutritional intake and by CH treatment was mostly distributed into the 150 kDa complex; paradoxically the species which most effectively maintains IGF in the circulation. Thus in conditions presumably conducive with growth related processes (high GH, high nutrition) access of circulating IGF to the tissues is apparently most restricted. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the view that 150kDa bound IGF represents a pool of endocrine IGF en route to tissue sites of action. Galactopoietic effects of GH in lactating ruminants appear to be exerted in the absence of a mammary GH receptor and are associated with increased plasma and mammary IGF-I content. Thus it has been proposed that blood borne IGF, acting in the classical endocrine fashion may be the mediator of GHs lactogenic effects. Consequently the lactating sheep surgically prepared by the catheterization of efferent mammary lymph may be a useful model for examining questions of IGF/BP physiology. In a further study, plasma and efferent mammary lymph concentrations of IGF-I were determined in lactating ewes before and after treatment with GH (10 mg/d) for 3 days. Analysis of paired plasma/lymph samples revealed that the capillary endothelium constitutes a barrier to the passage of macro molecules which reduces the concentration of IGF in lymph to ~ 35% plasma. A key observation from the current study was the GH dependence of mammary lymph IGF-I. Thus, GH was found to increase mammary lymph IGF-I concentrations by a proportionately greater amount than the increase in plasma IGF-I (P&lt;0.01). The increase in lymph IGF-I resulted from an increase in the concentration of IGF associated with both high molecular weight (150 kDa) and low molecular weight (40-50 kDa) binding fractions. However, the data indicate a proportionately greater increase in 40-50 kDa bound IGF-I in lymph compared with plasma suggesting that treatment either induces a selective redistribution of plasma 40-50 kDa IGF and BP into the mammary gland or, alternatively, treatment increases intra-mammary production of these factors. Ligand blot analysis of mammary lymph revealed IGFBP-3 and -2 as the major constituents of this fluid. IGFBP-2 declined in lymph with GH treatment whereas IGFBP-3 appeared to increase. Additionally, saturation analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of lymph IGFBP-3 was present in the 'free', uncomplexed form. Consequently observations that the total binding capacity (TBC) of the lymph 40-50 kDa fraction increased with treatment, would appear to result from an increase in IGFBP-3. Total binding capacity of the lymph 40-50 kDa binding fraction was found to increase by a proportionately greater amount that its plasma equivalent. Thus, if the lactogenic effects of GH are mediated by IGF distributed from blood into the mammary gland, the mechanism by which it is transferred would appear to involve BP of the 40-50 kDa pool and in particular IGFBP-3. In the final experimental section of this thesis a novel system was employed to examine tissue distribution and destinations of blood borne IGF-I. This involved intravenous infusion of the N-Met analog of IGF-I together with specific immunologic detection. For this an IGF antibody was employed which recognises the recombinant N-Met variant but demonstrates minimal cross-reactivity with any of a range of other IGF peptides including ovine plasma IGF-I and recombinant authentic sequence IGF-I. This antibody can therefore recognise the N-Met variant against a background of authentic endogenous IGF-I and was usefully applied to examining tissue destinations of the N-Met variant following iv infusion. Plasma N-Met IGF-I rose to plateau concentrations of ~150 ng/ml during iv infusion (Infusion rate, 8 &#181;g/kg/h). Analysis revealed the N-Met variant was distributed on plasma BP in much the same proportion as endogenous IGF. N-Met IGF-I immunoreactivity was identified in mammary lymph providing further evidence supporting the contention that blood borne IGF is distributed outside the vascular space. At the end of the infusion N-Met IGF-I was identified in all tissues examined contributing between 35% (in kidney) and 62% (spleen) to total IGF. Major differences in morphological distribution of blood derived (N-Met IGF) were revealed by autoradiography in post infusion tissue slices. Thus the N-Met IGF was found to contribute relatively little to total localizable IGF-I immunoreactivity in connective tissue elements of the samples examined (muscle and mammary) but, by contrast, blood derived (N-Met) IGF-I constituted ~85% of total IGF immunoreactivity in other tissues. In particular, these include the metabolically active regions of muscle and mammary (fibre and epithelium respectively). The evidence suggests therefore that fibre and epithelium may be targets for blood derived &#8216;endocrine' IGF. Differences in the abundance of blood derived IGF between tissues may relate to the accessibility (vascularization or capillary permeability) of specific tissues or, alternatively, to local rates of production and turnover of IGF in tissues. Thus the contribution of blood derived IGF to total localizable IGF may be expected to be less in tissues which actively synthesize IGF such as those in which autocrine/paracrine modes of IGF action are operative. Examples from the current study would be connective tissues of muscle and mammary. Conversely blood derived IGF would be expected to represent a greater proportion of total IGF in tissue targets for endocrine IGF. Support for the current data was obtained from IGF-I mRNA in situ hybridization studies performed on human fetal tissue (437). Stromal elements of muscle tissue (perimysium, epimysium) were identified as active sites of transcription as opposed to muscle fibre where message could not be detected. Thus the evidence suggests that the N-Met infusion model is a useful technique for delineating tissue targets for circulating (endocrine) IGF. It is now widely accepted that the primary actions of IGF on growth and development occur via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms close to its site of production. Nonetheless such arguments do not exclude the possibility of classical endocrine roles for the major pool of IGF present in the circulation. The primary thrust of this thesis has been to examine kinetics and tissue distribution of this pool of IGF. The data confirm the availability of blood borne IGF to extra vascular tissues and appear to indicate that it is distributed into the tissues on a selective basis and under physiological control. It may, therefore, be available to selected tissues to fill specific endocrine functions.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland, New Zealand : non-invasive screening for ciliary dysfunction and airway inflammation</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">Background: &#8216;Bronchiectasis&#8217; is usually a progressive disease defined as bronchial dilatation, with or without associated bronchial wall and lung parenchymal damage, and classically with pus in the bronchial lumen. There is no knowledge on the prevalence, aetiology, and severity of paediatric bronchiectasis in New Zealand. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder that can cause bronchiectasis and is characterised by specific structural ciliary abnormalities leading to impaired ciliary motility. It has been suggested that ciliary abnormalities may predispose Maori and Pacific Island people to bronchiectasis, but appropriate expertise and non-invasive technology to accurately investigate the condition has not been available in New Zealand. Additionally the exhaled gas nitric oxide (NO), a non-invasive marker of some types of airway inflammation, has been suggested as a useful screening test for PCD. The aims of this thesis were to: 1. Define the demographics, causes, and severity of the known paediatric bronchiectasis population of Auckland. 2. Establish a method for detecting primary and secondary ciliary dysfunction. 3. Explore non-invasive methods for differentiating primary and secondary ciliary disease. 4. Determine the prevalence of PCD in paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland. Methods: Observations were made on children with bronchiectasis who attended the Starship Children's Hospital, and a cohort of healthy children recruited from local Auckland schools. A retrospective review of the demographics and radiology scores (CXR and HRCT scan) as a measure of disease severity was made. The results were compiled into a bronchiectasis database and a measure of socio-economic factors (NZDep96 index) was incorporated. Equipment was created for the photometric method of assessment of ciliary beat frequency (CBF). After piloting, 3prospective studies were undertaken to evaluate skin prick allergy tests, exhaled and nasal NO, lung function and a nasal brushing for assessment of CBF and ultrastructural analysis in the normal and diseased children. Results. The estimated prevalence of paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland was ~2/10,000 and was disproportionately more common in the Pacific Island (6.3/10,000) and Maori children (2.8/10,000). Eighty eight percent of cases had bilateral disease, and 64% had 4 or more lobes involved. There was a wide range of presumed aetiologies but over half remained undiagnosed despite extensive investigation. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 3.2 years, and a median of 4 respiratory admissions pre-diagnosis. The NZDep96 index suggested significant associated socio-economic deprivation. A non-invasive protocol to brush nasal epithelium and the technology to assess CBF was created and piloted. Ethnic normal values were established for NO and CBF for healthy European and Pacific Island children. Insufficient Maori children could be recruited. CBF and NO values were not low and comparable with frequencies reported internationally using similar methodologies. Exhaled NO levels did not differ significantly between the children with bronchiectasis and controls, or between the bronchiectatic children who were and were not prescribed inhaled steroids. However CBF and nasal NO were lower in the children with bronchiectasis than controls. The percentage of abnormal ciliary structural defects in the control children was 3 times higher than reported controls, with no difference across ethnic groups. Similar abnormalities were seen in the children with bronchiectasis. These abnormalities were central microtubule defects, tubular additions or deletions, and partial dynein arm defects. In the individual children with bronchiectasis who had low CBF and nasal NO, no single primary ciliary defect was identified to conclusively diagnose PCD. Conclusions: Paediatric bronchiectasis is common and severe in Auckland. New Zealand but the condition has been neglected in terms of recognition. It is hoped that the establishment of a bronchiectasis database for children will not only facilitate collaborative research but also act as a template for a national bronchiectasis database for New Zealand, which can be used to support applications for health resources and funding. Importantly the thesis has resulted in a non-invasive method for assessing ciliary structure and function that could be used to investigate New Zealand children and adults. A wide variety of ciliary abnormalities were found in the New Zealand children that were most likely secondary phenomena, and the incidence of PCD in the population examined, if present, is small. More work is needed to increase the ciliary structural and functional 'library' for New Zealand children, and particularly for Maori children who were under assessed in this work. The possibility of another vulnerability factor, as yet not identified, either of innate immunity or airway defences may still underlie the high prevalence of bronchiectasis in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional and structural analyses of an olfactory receptor from Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="creator">Kiely, Aidan</field><field name="description">In insects, olfaction is mediated by a large family of integral membrane proteins, called olfactory receptors (ORs), that mediate the transduction of odorant binding into a neuronal signal. A functional assay for insect ORs was developed utilising calcium imaging in Sf9 cells. The Drosophila melanogaster OR, Or22a, was expressed using transient transfection, and its activity measured by monitoring increased intracellular calcium levels using a calcium&#8211;sensitive dye. The interaction of the odorants ethyl butyrate, pentyl acetate and ethyl acetate with Or22a were both dose&#8211;dependent and sensitive, with EC50 values of 1.53 x 10&#8722;11 M, 5.61 x 10&#8722;10 M and 3.72 x 10&#8722;9 M, respectively. Furthermore, Or22a expressed in Sf9 cells has a similar response profile to a range of odorants previously tested in vivo. This assay system will provide a useful tool for the investigation of insect olfactory receptor structure and function. A consensus of eleven transmembrane (TM) domain prediction algorithms suggested a model for Or22a that contains seven TM domains, reminiscent of GPCRs. To test this model empirically, the membrane topology of Or22a was determined using epitope&#8211;tagging of predicted loops followed by immunochemistry. These experiments revealed that Or22a has seven TM domains but that its orientation in the membrane is opposite to that of GPCRs, having a cytoplasmic N&#8211;terminus. This orientation was also observed for Epiphyas postvittana Or1, which suggests that this inverted topology may be common to all insect ORs. To test whether Or22a forms higher order structures, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins inserted into the intracellular loops of Or22a was employed. The third intracellular loop interacts strongly with itself in homo&#8211;multimers, with interactions between the first and first loops and first and third loops also observed. These experiments show that ligand binding ORs can form multimeric structures in heterologous cells. The co&#8211;transfection of Or83b into S2 cells had no impact on these interactions, however Or83b is likely expressed in this cell line. Finally, models of how a ligand binding OR interacts physically with the ion channel Or83b are presented, and approaches that could be used to distinguish between these models are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and activity of enzymes in the human placenta: pharmacological &amp; toxicological consequences in AZT therapy</field><field name="creator">Collier, Abby Cherise</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XME) in the human placenta, in particular the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases' (UGTs) role in the metabolism, transfer and disposition of the drug AZT, and to develop the human placental perfusion model into the first trimester. UGT, &#946;-glucuronidase, Cytochrome p4501A (CYPIA) and CYP reductase were present and active in the human placenta. CYP2E1 protein was expressed but not active. CYPIA, CYP2EI and the UGT2B subfamily were expressed across gestation, but the UGTIA subfamily was only expressed in first trimester placentas. The localisation of XME (the syncytiotrophoblast layer bordering the placental villi) did not change with gestation but enzyme activity and affinity did. Greater activify but lower affinity of UGT and CYPIA were observed in first trimester placentas than at term. In contrast, &#946;-glucuronidase had a high affinity, low activity profile in early gestation but the opposite at term. UGT and CYPIA activities in the first trimester placenta were induced by maternal cigarette smoking and may be synergistically induced by combined alcohol consumption and smoking. A significant correlation with higher UGT activity and earlier gestational age was observed. CYPIA exhibited a significant, negative correlation with maternal age across gestation. Maternal variables had no effect on &#946;-glucuronidase and their effects on the activity of CYP2EI and CYP reductase were not established. AZT caused apoptosis in the placenta and also increased reactive oxygen species and altered XME. The absence of serum enhanced these effects. Alterations in XME expression and activities included a decrease in UGT activity and increases in CYPIA, &#946;-glucuronidase, CYP reductase and glutathione-&#1029;-transferase activity in response to AZT exposure. AZT transport in a perfusion model was bi-directional and reached equilibrium approximately 3 h after addition of AZT into the maternal reservoir. In contrast, transfer of AZT glucuronide (AZT-G) showed significantly greater transport rates out of the fetal compartment resulting in AZT-G concentrations approximately 2-fold higher in the maternal circuit. Transfer of the co-factor UDPGA was significantly greater in the fetal direction and almost complete after 4h of perfusion. The low levels of glucuronidation of AZT catalysed by the human placenta (approximately 2% of a dose) are not due to insufficient transport of the co-factor UDPGA and are unlikely to be significant in terms of maternal whole-body clearance. Therapeutic failure of AZT in protecting the fetus is unlikely to be due to metabolism and clearance performed by the placenta but may be due to placental cytotoxicity. The development of the perfusion model into the first trimester placenta is technically achievable, but was impossible with the tissue available for these studies due to the method used to obtain placentas.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prevalence, natural history, and determinants of non-synostotic plagiocephaly and brachycephaly in infants</field><field name="creator">Hutchison, Barbara Lynne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does District Planning under the Resource Management Act 1991 Protect Biodiversity?</field><field name="creator">Bellingham, Mark</field><field name="description">Biodiversity decline has continued at a rapid pace in New Zealand in the past 15 years (OECD 2007), in spite of specific provisions for biodiversity conservation under the Resource Management Act 1991 (Froude 1997, Bellingham 2004).  This thesis has examined problems with biodiversity conservation implementation in district plans, that arise from planners not making full use of the available factual base for district planning, a lack of monitoring in New Zealand&#8217;s RMA planning, and failures by ecologists and planners to properly understand and communicate information for effective district planning.  A critique of the policy and plan framework for biodiversity conservation in the Auckland Region and case studies in Rodney District and Waitakere City show there are strong provisions for biodiversity conservation in these plans that support the implementation of biodiversity conservation through district planning.  There was a moderate to high level of internal compatibility in the planning framework, apart from a policy conflict between urban growth and infrastructure development versus the protection of natural values and amenity.  Although the biodiversity factual base available for the Rodney District and Waitakere City district plans for district planning was sound, but it wasn&#8217;t often used to provide appropriate or sufficient information for district planning.  This was hampered by the poor state of the environment monitoring, and no process for monitoring the effects that resource consents and permitted activities were having on biodiversity condition.  This was exemplified by the discovery that the Rodney District Plan&#8217;s incentive-based regime for biodiversity conservation had failed to arrest the loss of 2.5% per annum of indigenous forest cover from 1977-1998.  This went undetected through a lack of plan monitoring.  In Waitakere City, district plan rules led to the indigenous vegetation cover on private land increasing by 0.5% per annum during the same period, and this was undetected by the council also.  District planning will continue to fail to achieve biodiversity conservation unless changes significant occur in planning practice, policy development and plan implementation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">district planning</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">RMA</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypnosis, hypersensitivity and mood: some interactions between mind and body</field><field name="creator">Laidlaw, Tannis Marilyn</field><field name="description">Hypnosis has been used as a treatment modality to change physiological functioning almost since it was discovered. Particularly, it has been used in the treatment of psychosomatic illnesses. A series of studies was planned to explore the use of hypnosis within the context of recent advances in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. Type I hypersensitivity reactions were chosen as indicators of immunological functioning in allergy. Study One: This study using modern methodology and statistical analyses set out to test the hypothesis that it was possible to decrease reactions to histamine by hypnotic suggestion. Five subjects, all asthmatic and untrained in hypnosis, were given three hypnotic sessions where they were asked to control their reactions to histamine. These sessions were to be compared to three baseline sessions. A decrease in reactions was noted on the second administration of histamine calling into question studies that relied on a two session comparison. On subsequent sessions much unexplained variance was encountered, with the day upon which the sessions took place contributing significant amounts of the variance, giving rise to questions about what could cause these day to day changes. Study Two: Given the results of Study One, a method was subsequently devised in which serial, five-fold dilutions of allergen or histamine were administered to the subject's forearm with a standard Osterballe-type prick lancetter and reactions were recorded photographically on slide film. Areas were determined by computer-assisted image analysis. Seven healthy volunteers were tested for 8 sessions (testing included Profile of Moods Scale and Brief Mood Rating questionnaires, blood pressure, pulse and skin temperature). Mean wheal size and titration gradient data from allergen reactions correlated strongly with the psychological factor of liveliness but not irritability, although no manipulation of mood was involved. A stepwise regression analysis accounted for 61% of the variance of the allergen data, and 31% was from the liveliness factor alone. Thus, the more lively the subject felt, the smaller was the allergic response. The third study looked at a sample of 117 adult New Zealand subjects who volunteered to be tested with the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (Form A). 38 of these people also were tested on a second test used to assess hypnotisability, the Creative Imagination Scale. Results indicated that the CIS can be administered with a minimum of preamble negating the value of special "think-with" instructions. It appears from the evidence in this study that both the CIS and the HGSHS:A measure characteristics that are stable over the years since the tests were first published. Reassuringly, they both can be used throughout the adult age group, with neither age nor sex testing differentially. The means and standard deviations were found to be similar to those of university aged students from various countries and cultures around the world over the years. The two hypnotisability tests were found to be correlated with each other but on a factor analysis each loaded separately giving evidence that the two tests are assessing different but related abilities. Study Four was an intervention study using 38 subjects who participated in a control session and cognitive-hypnotic intervention session that used the skin test methodology developed in Study Two. When the results of the two sessions were compared, significant decreases were found in the size of the wheals after skin testing with allergen or histamine. The hypnotic method employed in this study used three specific procedures that appear to have contributed to the high success rate: challenge to the assumption that the subject has 'no imagination', self-generated scenes and the entire process had the seriousness removed so there was little or no fear of failure. Again, the significance of mood variables was considerable in ameliorating the skin test responses, and hypnotisability was a significant factor in predicting success at being able to use the intervention. Overall, these four studies have revealed that hypnosis can be used to change at least one aspect of physiological functioning, reactivity to skin tests. Mood variables have emerged as important mediators, with implications that mood should be assessed whenever physiological variables are being measured.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The carotid labyrinth in the primitive New Zealand frog, Leiopelma hochstetteri</field><field name="creator">Ensor, Donald Rivers</field><field name="description">The amphibian carotid labyrinth was first described in 1738, but its purpose has never been satisfactorily explained. Much of the extant literature has either been restricted to a particular aspect of the organ, or has been based on erroneous information. This thesis used the New Zealand frog Leiopelma hochstetteri because its primitive status might render some characteristics of the carotid labyrinth more clearly evident. The "gross" anatomy of the tiny (0.5 mm diameter) organ was examined by wax-plate reconstruction and by scanning electron microscopy. The cytology of the capillary plexus tissue was studied by light and transmission electron microscopy using conventionally prepared sections. The higher resolution of the electron microscope permitted a more exact study of the innervation of the organ. Neurophysiological experiments were undertaken, but the very short (0.6 mm) and fine carotid nerve proved intractable. A study of the in vivo flow of blood through the labyrinth, resolving the pulsatile variations in flow caused by the action of the heart, was first made by visual observation and then using instrumental methods. The tissues of the capillary plexus contain the same characteristic associations of Type I and Type II cells, together with nerve fibres, as are described in the carotid bodies of the Mammalia, and in the carotid labyrinths of other Amphibia. These associations, which are believed to represent chemoreceptor units, apparently have efferent synaptic complexes against the membrane of the Type I cell. The dense-cored vesicles within the Type I cells fall within the size range described for the other species. Similar characteristic cell groups, complete with nerve supplies, were also observed in the surrounding connective tissue. The carotid nerve contains about 15 myelinated and up to 150 fine (0.15-0.5&#181;m) unmyelinated axons and leaves the sheath of the lingual ramus of the glossopharyngeal nerve through a ganglion of 25-40 cells. It supplies the labyrinth alone. The capillary plexus tissue, in which the characteristic cells are dispersed, is a densely cellular connective tissue and provides a network of random channels for the throughflow of blood. Melanocytes, collagen and elastic fibres, and nerve fibres are embedded in the matrix. The organ is mechanically passive since the only smooth muscle is found as a thin layer in the proximal main chamber. Blood flow measurements utilized the moving erythrocytes as tracers. Their movement, visible through the semi-transparent arterial walls, was recorded with a television camera and later analyzed with a microkymograph. Simultaneous recording of the ECG-related velocity measurements to the phase of the cardiac cycle. Flow in the common carotid was markedly pulsatile, entering the labyrinth in bursts and causing it to swell, while flow in the internal carotid was steady. Flow in the external carotid reversed for a large part of the cycle, returning to the roots of that vessel as the entire organ was distended. The organ owes its pulse-filtering behaviour to the resistive effect of the capillary plexus, combined with a reservoir-like storage due to the compliance of the fibroelastic capsule. This function concurs with Ask-Upmark's observation that all mammals have some pulse-filtering device interposed in their cranial arterial supply. I propose this to be the main function of the labyrinth, accounting adequately for its complex vascular structure. Its undoubted chemoreceptor function clearly can coexist happily with this vascular one.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and management of cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="creator">Beaglehole, Ruth Bonita</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of pertussis in New Zealand and risk factors for pertussis in New Zealand infants</field><field name="creator">Grant, Cameron Charles</field><field name="description">Literature review Pertussis mortality and morbidity Mass immunisation was associated with a decrease in pertussis mortality and a profound reduction in pertussis incidence. Despite this pertussis remains prevalent. Infants account for the majority of pertussis deaths and hospitalisations. Immunisation Pertussis vaccines protect against disease rather than infection. Despite immunisation pertussis remains endemic. The efficacy of different whole cell and acellular pertussis vaccines varies considerably. There has only been a small increase in immunisation coverage in New Zealand over the past 25 years. Currently between 80% and 90% of New Zealand children receive the primary immunisation series. Other epidemiological features Bordetella pertussis is a highly infectious organism. Neither infection nor immunisation results in lifelong immunity. Pertussis affects all age groups. It is more severe in females than in males. The incidence has always been highest in infants and children but the reported incidence in adults is increasing. Pertussis epidemics occur at four yearly intervals. The epidemic periodicity has not been changed by immunisation. Risk factors for pertussis Contemporary case control studies from the United States have shown that exposure to someone outside of the home with pertussis increases the risk of introduction of pertussis into the home and that infants of adolescent mothers and of mothers with a preceding coughing illness are at increased risk of pertussis. Small sample size and imprecise measurement of immunisation status have compromised these studies. Other factors associated with an increased risk of pertussis in infants include younger age, low birth weight, the infant's immunisation status and household crowding. Prior to this current case control study there was no knowledge on the effect of infant characteristics, infant immunisation status, parental and household characteristics, or socioeconomic factors on the risk of pertussis in infants. Methods The pertussis mortality and hospital discharge statistics and notification data from 1872 to 2000 were reviewed. The characteristics of children hospitalised with pertussis during the 1995 to 1997 epidemic were described. Risk factors for pertussis in infants were determined using a case control study with two different control groups. A matched case-control design was used to compare infants with pertussis with well control infants from the community. An unmatched design was used to compare infants hospitalised with pertussis to infants hospitalised with other acute respiratory illnesses. Results Historical review of pertussis epidemiology Immunisation was associated with a significant decline in pertussis mortality rates in New Zealand. Pertussis incidence rates in New Zealand are five and 10 times higher than in the United Kingdom or the United States. New Zealand pertussis hospital discharge rates increased from 1920 to 1950, decreased from 1950 to 1970 and have been increasing since then. The severity of disease among those hospitalised in New Zealand is comparable to other developed countries. Case control study of risk factors for pertussis in infants In the community control sample factors associated with incomplete immunisation included poverty and household crowding, advice from a doctor that immunisations be delayed and the caregiver not having a record of the infant's immunisations. Primary and secondary pertussis in case households occurred in all age groups. Over half of the primary cases were infants. Factors associated with an increased risk of pertussis included incomplete immunisation of the infant, children five to nine years of age living in the household, household members with pertussis during the preceding two months and the family doctor advising that an immunisation be delayed. Preschool attendance by a household member was associated with a decreased risk of pertussis. Infants of low birth weight and infants with younger mothers were not at increased risk of pertussis. In a multivariate analysis, non-immunisation of other children in the household and the presence of someone in the household with clinical pertussis were associated with an increased risk of pertussis in infants. The associations between household members with cough and the risk of pertussis varied with the age of the household members and imply an age dependent disease modifying effect of immunisation. For many of the children in the study households it seems unlikely that any health professional knew whether or not they were fully immunised. Conclusions Immunisation reduced pertussis mortality in New Zealand. Pertussis hospitalisation rates are increasing despite improvements in the immunisation schedule. Sustained sub-optimal immunisation coverage appears to be the dominant reason for New Zealand&#8217;s excessive pertussis disease burden. Primary school aged children are important in household pertussis transmission.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychosomatic dimensions of chronic musculoskeletal pain</field><field name="creator">Large, Bob, 1945-</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore some psychosomatic dimensions of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Pain is a phenomenon which is universally recognised and experienced but nevertheless presents a very real epistemological problem. For convenience, the philosophical approach chosen here is that of linguistic parallelism which views pain as a range of abstract concepts defined in a variety of &#8216;languages&#8217; or disciplines in a complementary and interactive way. Psychiatric formulations of pain include the concepts of conversion, object relations and the associations of pain with a developmental history of suffering and defeat and a diagnosis of depression. These ideas have been to some extent confirmed by nomothetic studies of pain patients. Chronic, as opposed to acute, pain is associated with a broad range of physical, emotional and social changes and is a problem of such clinical magnitude that special multidisciplinary clinics have now become a feature of clinical services in most large centres. My own experience as a psychiatrist working in the Auckland Pain Clinic is described in this thesis. Over a four year period, 172 patients were assessed, comprising 15-20% of the total referrals to the clinic. The modal age was 45-54 years, with a male/female ratio of 7:10. The duration of pain was 5-10 years, the back being the most common site and musculoskeletal pain was by far the most frequent presentation. Most of the patients presented with psychiatric disorders in the neurotic-personality disorder spectrum; depression, anxiety and hysteria being frequent diagnoses. These findings are similar to other studies reviewed. Treatment was instituted in half of the patients seen and half of the treated patients improved or recovered. One third of the original sample returned a completed follow-up questionnaire 18 months to 5 years after presentation. Just under a half remained improved or recovered, the treated patients faring no better or wrose than those who refused or were not offered treatment, or who were referred elsewhere. There was a high rate of further consultation amongst all groups, but especially so for those who declined treatment. The treated patients and those referred elsewhere were significantly more likely to have found the psychiatric consultation helpful. EMG feedback, drug withdrawal and psychotherapy were more frequently associated with improvement than pharmacotherapy on short-term evaluation. On follow-up only EMG feedback maintained an advantage, Issues which emerged were the relationships between chronic pain, depression and antidepressant medication response; the role of anxiety and tension in chronic pain and the strong tendency towards continued help seeking amongst the majority of patients. Muscle tension has been invoked in the aetiology and maintenance of a variety of pain syndromes. The most intensively researched areas have been tension headache and temporomandibular joint pain where EMG feedback has become an established treatment technique, although there is still some controversy as to whether EMG feedback has any advantage over relaxation training as such. The use of EMG feedback training in other musculoskeletal conditions has been less well researched and doubt remains as to the role of generalised muscle tension in the causation of these conditions. An EMG feedback study was undertaken at the Auckland Pain Clinic using a within-subjects control- design. Eighteen subjects (12 females and 6 males) with neck and back pain were studied in terms of subjective reports of pain and EMG activity measurements under standardised conditions. Three conditions were compared, viz EMG feedback training, a control condition and a waiting list condition. The sequences of presentation of these conditions was counterbalanced in a design using two sets of latin squares to pick up any order effects. EMG feedback was the only treatment which significantly reduced EMG activity across sessions. An order effect was evident in that biofeedback was most effective when presented first but less so when presented after the control condition. Although estimates of present pain correlated with EMG activity, there was no statistical difference between pain score reductions when EMG feedback and control conditions were compared. Pain scores tended to decline during both conditions but the scores for &#8220;worst pain over one week&#8221; tended to rise. During the waiting list condition, present pain tended to increase while &#8220;worst pain over one week&#8221; tended to decline. Eleven subjects experienced an overall decrease in pain scores at the end of the study, while seven had increased pain. Declines in pain scores tended to be associated with a biofeedback training effect but this was not statistically significant. Improvement in pain was associated with high Present pain/EMG correlations when a rank order correlation was computed. This study provides some support for the use of relaxation methods in the management of musculoskeletal pain. It suggests that muscle tension may well play a role in the production and/or maintenance of musculoskeletal pain, although it does not account for all of the variance. The more interpersonal factor of illness behavior may well explain some aspects of pain not accounted for by pathophysiological factors such as muscle tension. Parson&#8217;s notions of the sick role and Mechanic&#8217;s concept of illness behavior have stimulated the by Pilowsky and Spence. We have made use of this questionnaire development of an &#8220;illness behavior questionnaire&#8221;/in a study involving 200 pain patients. A cluster analysis of these results produced profiles very similar to those found in Adelaide and adds validity to the groupings described by pilowsky and spence. Characteristically, patients with chronic pain tend to view their problems in somatic terms and to deny other problems in their lives, or if problems are admitted, to ascribe these problems to their pain. Illness behaviour profiles were found to cut across diagnostic categories when results from patients overlapping between the clinical diagnostic study and the illness behavior study were analysed. These illness attitudes therefore seemed to provide an alternative level of description to diagnostic systems. An analysis of therapeutic outcome in patients undergoing the biofeedback trial did not support the use of illness behaviour profiles as a prediction patients discussed here. Third is the Freudian mechanism of &#8220;conversion&#8221; which may account for pain syndromes where pathophysiological changes are not necessarily evident. These three concepts provide interlinking mechanism between adverse life experiences(with unpleasant affect) and musculoskeletal pain. These are part of an intrapersonal system which is potently influenced by the interpersonal and physical environment of the individual. Illness behaviour is at the social interface between intrapersonal and interpersonal systems. Research directions are suggested which may further elucidate the workings of this proposed psychosomatic formulation of chronic musculoskeletal pain</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Maori face to gambling = Kanohi ki te kanohi</field><field name="creator">Dyall, L. C. T. (Lorna Christine Te Aroha)</field><field name="description">Background Prior to the commencement of this study, gambling was not considered a significant health issue for Maori, even though the first national gambling prevalence study in New Zealand in 1991, identified that Maori had at least three times the risk of problem gambling of non-Maori. In the early 1990s, through the provision of a gambling telephone helpline and gambling counselling services, it was identified that Maori and in particular Maori women, were increasingly seeking help with problems with gambling. Gambling is an integral part of the culture of New Zealand. To understand gambling and problem gambling requires an understanding of the social, economic and cultural context it plays in being Maori. Aim of Study This study investigated whether gambling and problem gambling is an emerging health issue for Maori and if so, the extent of the problem, its effects on Maori and health approaches, and interventions which are likely to be effective for Maori. A public health approach to address problem gambling has been investigated and a plan developed. Methodology This study has been undertaken from a Maori-centered and an action-oriented research approach. It has involved integrating existing and new information from the following sources: Maori patterns of gambling and expenditure, gambling prevalence data, Maori utilisation of gambling treatment services and gambling by indigenous people. Fifteen Maori problem gamblers have been interviewed to understand from the "inside looking out" their experience of problem gambling. Thirty key informants have also been interviewed to understand from the "outside looking in" their perspective as to whether gambling is an emerging health issue for Maori. This research has involved quantitative analysis and qualitative research. Findings This study has found that problem gambling is an emerging public health issue for Maori. The effects of problem gambling for Maori are invisible and masked by other health problems such as alcohol abuse or mental health problems. Maori prevalence of problem gambling is similar to other indigenous populations which have shared similar historical and socio-economic experiences. Problem gambling often leads to crime, imprisonment, development of other health problems and the break down of families. Focusing alone on problem gambling ignores the real issues for Maori, a wider perspective is needed which focuses on Maori and tribal development. A public health strategy is proposed to reduce Maori gambling related harm.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological and behavioural measures of central auditory processing in adult cochlear implant users</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Andrea Susan</field><field name="description">This study aimed to determine the relationship between auditory evoked potential measures, speech perception and frequency discrimination in 12 experienced adult cochlear implant (CI) users and to compare the evoked potential results in the CI subjects to those of a group of age- and gender-matched control subjects with normal hearing. The CI subjects all used the Nucleus CI-22 implant with the SPEAK processing strategy. Subject age range was 27-74 years (mean 50.9 years). All had used their implant for a minimum of one year (range 13-76 months, mean duration of implant use 37.5 months).Duration of profound deafness prior to implantation ranged from 1 - 40 years (mean 15.6 years).Middle latency response (MLR), obligatory N1-P2 cortical potentials, mismatch negativity and P3a auditory evoked potential were recorded. Speech perception was evaluated using tests from "The Minimum Speech Test Battery for Adult Cochlear Implant Users". Frequency discrimination was measured using a two-alternative forced choice procedure, to record difference limens (DL) for a 1000Hz tone. Duration of deafness correlated strongly with speech perception scores with poor scores reflecting greater years of deafness. The most sensitive of all the evoked potential measures was P2 latency, with strong relationships found between P2 and duration of deafness and speech perception scores. Earlier P2 latencies were associated with shorter durations of deafness and higher speech perception scores. In general, mismatch negativity was absent or degraded in CI subjects with poor speech scores. In better implant users mismatch negativity was typically present to both large and small frequency differences and demonstrated characteristic changes of increased latency and decreased area and amplitude for the more difficult discrimination task (as seen in the normal hearing group). Na amplitude of the MLR correlated negatively with duration of deafness, with small amplitudes reflecting greater duration of deafness. Frequency DLs were very variable, and no strong relationships were found between these and the evoked potential or speech perception measures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders of the human brain</field><field name="creator">Connor, Bronwen Jane</field><field name="description">Neurotrophic factors are a family of polypeptides that promote the differentiation, growth and survival of numerous central nervous system neurons during development and adulthood. It has been proposed that alterations in neurotrophic factor protein or receptor expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. Recent research supports the therapeutic use of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders. However, while information has been obtained regarding the structure and function of neurotrophic factors and their receptors (trk receptors) in the developing and mature rodent central nervous system, little research has been performed examining the expression and functional role of these factors in the normal and diseased human brain. This thesis investigated the role neurotrophic factors and trk receptors play in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. Using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridisation techniques, the regional distribution and cellular localisation of neurotrophic factors and trk receptors was examined throughout both the adult rat and normal human brain. The expression of individual neurotrophic factors and trk receptors was also examined in human post mortem normal, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease brain tissue, as well as in an animal model of apoptotic nerve cell death. Individual neurotrophic factors exhibited a specific and heterogeneous regional pattern of distribution throughout the adult human brain. Neurotrophic factor expression was detected in several neuronal populations which exhibit selective vulnerability in various neurodegenerative disorders. Alterations in the expression of neurotrophic factors within specific regions of the human brain may result in neuronal atrophy, possibly via apoptotic mechanisms. A significant reduction in the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed within the hippocampus and temporal cortex of the Alzheimer's disease brain. A loss of neuroprotection afforded by BDNF may contribute to the progressive atrophy of neurons in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The high-affinity trk receptors, trkA and trkB (full-length and truncated) were also altered within the Alzheimer's disease brain. TrkA receptor-immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes in the CA1 region of the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus, some of which were associated with &#946;-amyloid plaques. Truncated trkB receptors were found in high levels in senile plaques while the full-length trkB receptor was expressed in glial-like cells in the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. The appearance of trkA and trkB receptors in astrocytes and plaques in the Alzheimer's disease brain might be related to &#946;-amyloid deposition and could be implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) protein expression were also observed within the Alzheimer's disease brain. IGF-I-immunoreactivity was expressed in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes in the Alzheimer's disease temporal cortex. These observations may indicate that IGF-I is involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. The induction of IGF-I in response to neuronal injury may be an attempt to inhibit mechanisms that result in delayed neuronal death. In addition, neurotrophic factor expression was examined in the Huntington's disease brain. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and transforming growth factor-&#945; (TGF-&#945;) were significantly reduced within both the Huntington's disease globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Reduced GDNF and TGF- &#945; levels within the Huntington's disease brain may produce a loss of local or target-derived neurotrophic support within the basal ganglia and contribute to the preferential degeneration of medium-sized spiny projection neurons within the Huntington's disease striatum. Moderate hypoxic-ischemic (Hl) injury was used as an animal model of apoptotic nerve cell death. In agreement with the observations made in the Alzheimer's disease brain, moderate Hl injury resulted in the loss of BDNF within the rat hippocampus. In contrast, an increase in trkB (truncated) receptor expression was detected within glial cells in the rat brain. Alterations in BDNF and trkB receptor levels may lead to a loss of neuroprotection and the initiation of downstream mechanisms resulting in the induction of apoptotic processes. A cascade of events similar to those observed within the rat Hl model may occur within human neurodegenerative disorders. This study demonstrated that, while the neuropathogenesis of both Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease is complex, alterations in individual neurotrophic factor or trk receptor expression within selectively vulnerable cortical or subcortical regions may play a role in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, these results support the proposal that neurotrophic factors may be considered for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders by protecting against neuronal cell loss and by increasing the function of surviving neuronal populations.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of Giardia infection in New Zealand and the risk in children</field><field name="creator">Hoque, Mohammad Ekramul</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chamier the Epicurean : the life and works of George Chamier (1842-1915)</field><field name="creator">Sturm, Sean Roderick</field><field name="description">George Chamier (1842-1915) was an engineer and novelist, who was born and died in England, but spent most of his life on an eccentric orbit around the outskirts of the British Empire&#8212;through New Zealand, Australia and China and back to England again. After he had established himself as an engineer in Australia, he looked back on his life in a trilogy of autoethnographical novels, which work through the problem of how an &#8220;unsettled settler&#8221; such as he might get settled in the settler colonies. Philosopher Dick (1890) and A South-Sea Siren (1895) are set in the eighteen-sixties in North Canterbury, New Zealand on a back country station and in a small town respectively; The Story of a Successful Man (1895) is set in the eighteen-seventies in &#8220;Marvellous Melbourne.&#8221; This thesis, &#8220;Chamier the Epicurean,&#8221; examines Chamier&#8217;s life and (fictional) works in the light of two key questions. The first is: How can we understand the distinctive critical perspective on life in the settler colonies in the early days of European settlement that his novels articulate? The &#8220;outside insideness&#8221; of his position as an unsettled settler can account for the critical purchase he has on his own culture. Such a perspective is unusual in the history of local settler literature, not just because it is critical of settler society or &#8220;unsettling,&#8221; but because it is critical in an unusual way: Chamier unsettles himself by problematising his own position as a settler, thereby generating a critical autoethnography&#8212;to borrow Deborah Reed-Danahay&#8217;s definition, a critical &#8220;self (auto) ethnography&#8221; that is also &#8220;the ethnography of [his] own group,&#8221; his own ethnos (people). And the second question that informs this thesis is: How can we understand the relation between his life and works, given the degree to which the former seems to inform the latter? In the novels, he makes sense of his life in hindsight as a sentimental education. He has his autoethnographical &#8220;stand-ins&#8221; take on a series of sentimental personas in the attempt to get themselves settled as they move through the Australasian colonies in an ironic appropriation of the grand narrative of settlement as a progress from frontier to town to city. To see his life in hindsight as &#8220;mapped out&#8221; in this way was a gesture of aesthetic settlement that enabled Chamier to achieve an Epicurean equanimity he was able to find only fleetingly in the scramble of life in the settler colonies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control for uncertain networked control systems with random delays</field><field name="creator">Huang, Dan, 1980-</field><field name="description">Networked control systems (NCSs) are a type of distributed control systems where sensors, actuators, and controllers are interconnected through a communication network. This system setup has the advantage of low cost, &#176;exibility, and less wiring, but it also inevitably invites some delays and data loss into the design procedure. The focus of this thesis is to address the problem of analysis and design of networked control systems when the communication delays are varying in a random fashion. This random feature of the time delays is typical for commercially used networks, such as a DeviceNet (which is a controller area network (CAN)) and Ethernet network. Models for communication network delays are &#175;rst developed, in which Markov processes are used to model these random network-induced delays. Based on such models, we establish novel methodologies for stability analysis, control with disturbance attenuation, and fault estimation for a class of uncertain linear/nonlinear uncertain NCSs with random communication network-induced delays in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to- actuator channels. Data packet dropouts in the communication channels also have been taken into consideration in the modelling and design procedure. The main technique used in this thesis is based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin method, which results in delay-dependent controllers. We &#175;rst consider the design prob- lems for uncertain linear NCSs. In this case, state feedback controllers and dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to satisfy both stability and disturbance at- tenuation requirements for this class of NCSs. Moreover, a robust fault estimator that ensures the fault estimation error is less than a prescribed performance level is designed. We further go on to address the control problems for uncertain nonlinear NCSs. The nonlinear plant is &#175;rst described by the T-S fuzzy model. Based on this model, stability analysis, disturbance attenuation, and fault estimation problems are studied for uncer- tain nonlinear NCSs. It should be noted that system uncertainties, disturbances and noises are addressed in both cases. The existence of such controllers and fault estimators are given in terms of the solvability of bilinear matrix inequalities. Iterative algorithms are proposed to change this non-convex problem into quasi-convex optimization problems, which can be solved e&#174;ectively by available mathematical tools. Finally, to demonstrate the e&#174;ectiveness and advantages of the proposed design methodologies in this thesis, numerical examples are given in each designed control systems. The simulation results show that the proposed design methodologies can achieve the prescribed performance requirements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic modelling of rat invasions among islands in the New Zealand archipelago</field><field name="creator">Miller, Steven Duncan</field><field name="description">This project was formulated with the purpose of advancing knowledge of the invasion dynamics of rats within archipelagos in New Zealand. The concentration on islands reflected the conservation focus of this project - islands are the last refuges for many native New Zealand species that cannot survive in the wild on the mainland. This project can be divided into four areas: 1. Data collection: There was no intent for innovation here, but a deeper understanding of the environments in which rats are born, breed, migrate, and die was developed. 2. Development of tools for data exploration: &#8226; A user-friendly point-and-click graphical interface for the R program was designed to allow any user to easily explore simple genetic characteristics of the data. &#8226; A novel method for exploring the genetic similarity between individuals was developed and showcased with real data, proving successful in cases of both high and low genetic differentiation, and in detecting likely individual migrants. 3. Improvement of a method for estimating migration: &#8226; An attempt was made to improve the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure underlying this method. &#8226; The migration model used by the method was significantly improved, so that it could cope with any level of migration. Previously, results from situations where migration rates were high were invalid. 4. Investigated topics of ecological interest: &#8226; Field measurements of rats were used to show that Norway rats tend to have larger masses than ship rats, southern rats are generally larger than northern rats, but the effect on mass of living on an island as opposed to the mainland depends on the latitude. It was also shown that relative tail length is a good species discriminator. &#8226; Multiple paternity was confirmed for both Norway and ship rats. This breeding characteristic might form part of the explanation for why rats are such successful invaders. During the project, case studies involving rats on Big South Cape Island, Great Barrier Island and in the Bay of Islands were used to highlight the methods developed, and provided some unexpected and fascinating results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rattus spp.</field><field name="subject">Island ecology</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Placing the lived experience(s) of TB in a refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Jody</field><field name="description">Although rates of tuberculosis (TB) in much of the western world have steadily declined since the Second World War, this infectious disease remains a leading cause of death among those living in impoverished circumstances. Social science perspectives have argued that TB is as much a reflection of socio-economic inequality and the uneven distribution of power and resources as it is about biological processes.  In this thesis I explore the lived experience of TB within the Somali refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand.  While migrants and refugees are frequently blamed for the resurgence in TB in Western countries, very little is known about the determinants that underlie this manifestation of the disease. The present research addresses this gap in the literature by employing a transdisciplinary social science approach that considers the determinants of health and illness that range across the social, cultural economic and political domains of human experience. The geographical underpinnings of the work are borne out in the fundamental goal: to (literally and metaphorically) place the lived experience of health, disease (and particularly TB) within the Somali refugee community in the wider context of migration and resettlement.  Employing qualitative methods I draw upon participants&#8217; narratives to highlight the different ways in which Somali health beliefs and experiences have been shaped by wider structural forces.  I demonstrate that within Auckland, Somalis encounter multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage.  The combined impacts of this disadvantage have a profound influence on their health and illness experience, particularly in terms of the development and ongoing occurrence of TB.  Respondents with TB recounted widespread stigma that exacerbated the harm incurred by the illness itself.  Although Somalis are highly marginalised, the thesis acknowledges the agency and creativity exerted by people in fashioning the course of their life within the context of considerable structural constraints.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">illness</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">resettlement</field><field name="subject">Somalis</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the mechanical and oxygen barrier properties of microfibril reinforced composites</field><field name="creator">Shields, Ryan John</field><field name="description">A relatively new type of reinforced composite material, derived from immiscible blends of thermoplastic homopolymers, is characterised in this doctoral research.  Microfibril Reinforced Composites (MFCs) utilise common engineering and commodity polymers to create high strength and stiffness microfibrils dispersed in an isotropic matrix.  Unlike traditional polymer composites, MFCs use the dispersed component of a blend to create an even distribution of in situ reinforcing microfibrils via a simple extrusion, drawing and processing technique.  This research quantifies the mechanical and oxygen gas barrier properties of polyolefin-based MFCs containing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microfibrils.  It is concerned not only with identifying MFCs with the best properties, but also with how manufacturing parameters influence those properties.  Characterisation is split into several parts.  Initial investigations into blend development during extrusion and drawing were conducted.  The main purpose of this was to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing the morphological changes that occur during production.  Blend viscosity ratio and capillary number were identified as key factors in determining the onset of coalescence, deformation and break up of the dispersed polymer.  The effects on microfibril formation of several important manufacturing parameters were highlighted, with die diameter and extrusion speed the most influential of these.  A significant skin-core microstructure was observed.  Formation of elongated microfibres (with negligible molecular chain alignment) was shown to occur during extrusion, which was subsequently justified via modelling of the shear stress flow fields in the die. Drawn blends gave very high tensile strengths and stiffnesses due to highly oriented molecular chains.  A threshold draw ratio of 3.5, at which properties change considerably, was identified.  Mechanical properties of injection moulded MFCs from polypropylene were not considerably better than the neat matrix polymer.  However, those from polyethylene (PE) showed significant improvement via injection moulding and directional compression moulding.  MFCs with just 30% microfibril content displayed tensile properties up to six times greater than neat PE.  Measurements of oxygen gas permeability highlighted improvements of up to 65%.  Processing and cooling conditions were shown to significantly influence permeability via a Taguchi experimental design analysis.  MFC storage containers from PE/PET were injection moulded as proof-of-concept on completion of the research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymer</field><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291401 Polymers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291402 Composite materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of mannosylated peptides as components for synthetic vaccines</field><field name="creator">Kowalczyk, Renata</field><field name="description">The immune system often recognises tumour cells and infectious agents from the unique peptides found on their surfaces therefore, synthetic peptides of similar structure can be used as vaccines to stimulate the immune system. Despite the problems associated with proteolysis and delivery to the immune system,  peptide-based vaccines have enormous potential due to their ease of synthesis and purification. The aim of this research was to synthesise ligands for mannose receptors (MRs) that are found on human Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), for use in synthetic vaccines. Carbohydrate bearing antigens are recognised by MRs which play an important role in binding antigens, migration of dendritic cells (DCs) and interaction of DCs with lymphocytes.  Hence, incorporation of a sugar residue into a peptide chain can be used to enhance antigen presentation. This thesis describes the synthesis of fluorescein labelled O-mannosylated peptides using either manual or microwave assisted solid phase glycopeptide synthesis (SPGS) on pre-loaded WANG resin. The mannosylated peptides thus prepared can be tested for their ability to bind mannose receptors on human APCs in vitro. In order to prepare compounds that could be analysed in biological screens, a fluorescent label (5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) was introduced into the glycopeptides via the N&#945;- or the N&#949;-amino group of the lysine residue. It was found that preparation of the glycopeptide was more facile when the peptide chain was built onto the N&#949; of Lys (label into N&#945;) rather than onto the N&#945; of Lys (label into N&#949;). In order to overcome problems experienced when introducing more than one glycosylated building block into the peptide chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker was employed as a sugar carrier. It was found that mono- and dimannosylated building blocks attached to PEG carrier were incorporated more easily into the peptide chain compared to mono- and dimannosylated serine units. Importantly, microwave technology (CEM Liberty microwave peptide synthesiser) was used for SPGS which resulted in improved purity and yields of the glycopeptides thus prepared with a significant reduction in reaction times. The first fifteen glycopeptides prepared  in the present study were tested for binding to mannose receptors. Several compounds have shown improved binding to monocytes (bear MRs) in comparison to lymphocytes (do not bear MRs), in the presence of calcium ions. Calcium dependent binding is specific for C type lectin receptor family  that MRs belong to.

The problem is twodimensional and assumes invariance in the width of the plates. All non-linear physical effects are neglected. The plates are floating on a body of water of finite depth and each plate has uniquely defined properties. The problem is formulated by imposing boundary conditions on the eigenfunction expansion of Laplace&#8217;s equation. A set of transmission and reflection coefficients is generated, which is solved by applying the edge conditions and matching at each plate boundary. We label this solution method the Matched Eigenfunction Expansion Method (MEEM). The problem is solved for a variety of edge conditions including free, clamped, sliding, springed and hinged. To verify the MEEM results, the problem is also solved using a Green Function Method. The convergence of the two methods is compared and found to be almost identical. The MEEM is used to simulate wave&#8211;ice interaction in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ). The model removes the resonance effects and predicts that the transmitted energy is independent of floe length, provided the wavelength is more than three times the floe length. The model predicts an exponential decay of wave energy with distance of propagation through the MIZ, which agrees with experimental findings. The results have been summarised in a graph with the attenuation coefficient expressed as a function of period for various floe thicknesses. We also provide an estimate of the attenuation coefficient using an approximation theory. The displacements of the MEEM are compared against a series of laboratory experiments performed in a two-dimensional wave-tank and show good agreement. The attenuation model results are compared against a series of field experiments carried out in the Arctic and off the West Antarctic Peninsula. Generally, the decay rates of the model agree well with the field experiments in diffuse ice. We suggest that factors other than wave scatter are relevant in models of wave-attenuation in non-diffuse ice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescents&#8217; interpretation of smoking imagery in film: implications for future smoking</field><field name="creator">McCool, Judith.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disability following car crashes: an epidemiological investigation</field><field name="creator">Ameratunga, Shanthi Neranjana</field><field name="description">Background Road traffic injury is projected to rank as the third largest contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. Disability is a significant component of the burden of disease ranking. Most published data on traffic crash outcomes, however, focus primarily on deaths and hospitalisations. Reliable estimates of post-crash disability and information on factors that modify the disabling process are essential to prioritise and allocate appropriate resources for road traffic injury prevention and interventions that reduce the risk of secondary disability. Aims To quantify the risk of disability associated with serious injury crashes in car drivers in a defined population; to explore the extent to which this risk is modified by chronic alcohol abuse; and to critically review methodological approaches that can redress the inadequate epidemiological attention to injury-related disability. Methods Systematic reviews were conducted to examine the available epidemiological evidence quantifying the association of car crashes with disability and the effect of alcohol on the risk of post-injury disability. Studies published or presented between January 1980 and April 2003 were reviewed. No language restriction was imposed. A population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Auckland region of New Zealand recruited drivers exposed to serious injury crashes (identified through a surveillance system monitoring hospital admissions of injured car occupants). A representative sample of car drivers in the region was identified through roadside surveys (controls). The participants were interviewed at recruitment (to obtain pre-crash information from crash drivers and baseline data from controls) and re-interviewed at five and eighteen-months follow-up. Structured interviews on all three occasions included the Short Form-36, a global health change indicator, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Information on a range of potential confounders was sought at baseline through the interview, alcohol measurements and clinical records. Results Studies identified in the systematic reviews revealed that published estimates of the risk of post-crash disability ranged from 2% to 57%. The evidence regarding the effect of alcohol on post-injury disability is inconclusive largely because none examined this association directly. Most studies identified in the reviews were limited by several methodological problems including the absence of appropriate comparison groups, inadequate or no adjustment for confounding, significant potential for selection bias due to the study setting, high levels of loss to follow-up, and missing data. In the prospective cohort study, 215 crash drivers (75% follow-up) and 254 controls (69%) completed the 18-month interview. Overall, 40% of the drivers who were hospitalised, 20% of the crash drivers not hospitalised, and 7% of the controls reported deteriorated health at 18 months relative to their baseline health. This represents a tenfold excess risk of disability among hospitalised drivers and a three-fold excess risk among non-hospitalised crash drivers, relative to drivers in the general population. Among crash drivers reporting an overall decline in health, clinically important reductions in general and mental health were apparent over the follow-up period despite improving physical health and function. This trend was more evident among non-hospitalised than hospitalised crash drivers. Compared with drivers who were neither involved in a crash nor defined as hazardous drinkers, crash drivers who were hazardous drinkers had a seven-fold excess risk of a clinically significant (&#8805; 10%) decline in the SF-36 general health score (OR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.84-25.43). Crash drivers who were not hazardous drinkers had a three-fold risk (OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.14-7.89). The results indicated an important interaction between crash involvement and chronic alcohol abuse in potentiating the risk of disability. Conclusion Serious traffic crashes are associated with significant longer-term disability in a substantial proportion of survivors with an apparent worsening of mental health over time. Definitions of disability and estimates of the burden of disability following traffic injury remain highly variable in the published literature and it is timely for the international research community to develop a more systematic and consistent approach to this major and increasing component of the global burden of disease. By addressing the main methodological limitations of previous studies, this study revealed that chronic alcohol abuse potentiates the risk of post-crash disability. The findings suggest that measures for preventing road traffic crashes as well as efforts to identify problem drinkers among crash survivors should be intensified. The thesis highlights the need for robust indicators of non-fatal injury to monitor the impact of road safety programs and large-scale epidemiological studies to investigate the spectrum and determinants of post-injury disability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of a Maori Noho Marae smoking cessation intervention: utilising a kaupapa Maori methodology</field><field name="creator">Glover, Marewa</field><field name="description">Maori smoking prevalence rates are double those of non-Maori. Despite recent government funded health promotion targeting Maori, this disparity appears to be widening. Smoking prevalence rates for Pakeha New Zealanders continue to fall, whereas Maori smoking prevalence rates remain stable at 50% of all Maori adults over the age of 15. In response to community demand for smoking cessation assistance, some Maori health providers developed a residential intervention based on marae. This study examined the effectiveness of that approach to aiding smoking cessation among Maori. A secondary purpose of the study was to support the development of uniquely Maori approaches to research, by utilising a kaupapa Maori methodology. The literature on kaupapa Maori health research methodology was reviewed. Consequently, Te Whare Tapa Wha, a contemporary Maori paradigm is used as the central organising framework for analysing and understanding both the act of research and smoking behaviour. Two groups of smokers were interviewed, a group undertaking a Noho Marae smoking cessation programme (n=26) and a group of unaided quitters (n=104). Participants were interviewed prior to their quit attempt and again four months later. Nineteen of the unaided quitters were lost to follow-up. Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected. Few significant differences existed between the groups at the first interview. Among participants who completed both interviews, point prevalence at follow-up was 35% for the Noho Marae group versus 14% for the unaided group. The findings support the effectiveness of Noho Marae smoking cessation interventions. Recommendations on how to strengthen New Zealand's tobacco control programme are made. A greater emphasis on delivering to whanau, rather than focusing interventions on individuals, is recommended. Priority is currently given to groups identified as having higher smoking rates. Decline in smoking prevalence may be hastened by identifying and serving the groups most ready to change smoking behaviour. Further research is indicated, for example, to better understand the smoking cessation needs of pregnant Maori women.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of clinical outcome measures for children with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Mackey, Anna H</field><field name="description">There are a lack of reliable and valid clinical outcome measures to assess the effects of medical interventions in children with cerebral palsy, potentially compromising research and clinical practice in this area. The objective of this thesis was to identify and develop reliable outcome measures that could be used to evaluate the effects of botulinum toxin A in children with cerebral palsy. Six studies were undertaken in both normative and cerebral palsy populations to address this aim. Two studies investigated the reliability and validity of commonly used measures of lower limb function; three-dimensional gait analysis and visual gait assessment. Four studies investigated measures of upper limb function in children with cerebral palsy. An objective three-dimensional measure of upper limb function was developed and used to examine the reliability and validity of additional upper limb measures of muscle tone and arm function and to complete an objective assessment of upper limb botulinum toxin use in this population. The results demonstrated that three-dimensional and visual gait analyses are reliable and valid measures for children with cerebral palsy. For the upper limb this work has resulted in the development of an objective and reliable three-dimensional kinematic measure of upper limb function. A reliability assessment of the modified Tardieu scale found this measure to have poor reliability in detecting dynamic muscle tone in children with cerebral palsy, indicating limited value as a research tool. The results of the pilot study examining upper limb botulinum toxin A use in a group of ten children with hemiplegia, found small functional gains following treatment, as determined by the three-dimensional kinematic measure and Melbourne Assessment. These two measures were found to have moderate agreement in the determination of range of motion during specific upper limb functional tasks. This work has established the reliability and validity of a range of measures appropriate for use in children with cerebral palsy. The use of valid and reliable outcome measures provides a greater understanding of the complexities of cerebral palsy and ultimately will lead to improved outcome and greater treatment opportunities for families and children with cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element model of myocardial structure: implications for electrical activation in the heart</field><field name="creator">Le Grice, Ian John</field><field name="description">We have developed a mathematical representation of ventricular geometry and myocardial architecture using a three-dimensional finite element model which incorporates new information on the layered organization of cardiac muscle cells in ventricular myocardium. This model has been used to make a detailed and quantitative comparison of cardiac geometry and fibre organization. Extensive geometric measurements were made in dog hearts arrested in diastole and fixed at zero transmural pressure. These measurements included: ventricular epicardial and endocardial surface geometry (25 hearts), muscle fibre orientations (6 hearts), epicardial coronary vessels (24 hearts), and the specialized conduction system (3 hearts). A finite element mesh was fitted to geometric data for each heart and was shown to provide a faithful representation of the ventricular surfaces. RMS fitting errors were: epicardium 0.75 &#177; 0.18 mm, RV endocardium 1.75 &#177; 0.36 mm, and LV endocardium 1.24 &#177; 0.30 mm (with an appropriately refined mesh). Comparison of coronal cross-sections generated from the meshes demonstrated that ventricular shape is very consistent for hearts of similar size. Myocardial fibre fields were fitted to fibre orientation data and compared at matched sites. The fibre fits were shown to be within the range of measurement error. At equivalent sites fibre fields showed consistent regional differences in transmural fibre angle variation. Comparison of the geometric data revealed very similar patterns of both coronary vessel topology and Purkinje fibre distribution. Two further dog hearts were arrested and fixed as outlined above, and ventricular geometry was measured. The ventricular walls were subdivided into radial base-apex segments from which thick (100 &#181;m) sections were cut. Simple digital imaging procedures were used to characterize the macroscopic organization revealed in a) transmural and b) serial tangential thick sections. These studies confirm that ventricular myocardium is a discrete laminar structure rather than a uniformly branching continuum as has previously been believed. In the transmural plane, myocardial sheets run from endocardium to epicardium in a characteristic pattern which varies at different ventricular sites. It has also been shown that the extent of coupling between adjacent myocardial layers varies transmurally with more extensive interconnections between layers in the subepicardial and subendocardial regions than in the midwall. Our finite element model of cardiac anatomy has been extended to incorporate a representation of the laminar organization of ventricular myocardium. The refined model provides a very good representation of our experimental myocardial sheet data (RMS fitting error = 27&#176;). Finally we review the approaches to modelling electrical activity in the heart and demonstrate the use of our model in studies of ventricular activation.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The gallbladder epithelium in experimental cholelithiasis</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sum Ping</field><field name="description">1. The behaviour of the gallbladder epithelium in three models of experimental cholelithiasis has been studied. The models are : (a) rabbits when fed a lithogenic diet containing 0.75% dihydrocholesterol for 7 days (b) mice when fed a lithogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid for 42 days, and (c) guinea pigs when given subcutaneous injections of Lincomycin (60 mg/kg) for 7 days. 2. The morphological changes in the gallbladder epithelium during gallstone formation have been studied with light microscopy and autoradiography. In all three models, there was a marked increase in cell proliferation early in the lithogenic process before stones were formed. Epithelial dysplasia was common. In the mouse and guinea pig, these cellular proliferative and dysplastic changes progressed to metaplasia with new gland formation. 3. The quantitative and qualitative presence of mucus (glycoproteins) in the gallbladder epithelium has been studied by glycoprotein histochemistry of microscopic sections, by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and by chemical extraction and analysis of the monosaccharide radicles of the soluble glycoproteins. In all three models, a progressive increase in histochemical staining reaction in the epithelial cells was observed and commenced at a time before stones were formed. Results of the electron microscopic studies supported the histochemical study and in addition, demonstrated the presence of increased amounts of mucus droplets in the subapical zones of gallbladder epithelial cells. Extraction and chemical analysis of the soluble glycoproteins showed a quantitative increase in the glycoprotein content of the gallbladder, starting before stones were formed and persisted to when stones had formed. Both the histochemical and the chemical studies failed to demonstrate a qualitative difference in the mucus produced at different stages. 4. Fluid transport across the gallbladder mucosa has been quantitated by an in vitro preparation (Diamond 1964) in the rabbit and the guinea pig models- In both models, there was an increase in the rate of fluid transport detectable before stones were formed, and returned to normal values when stones were formed and after the lithogenic treatment was stopped.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of cell death in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">MacGibbon, Geraldine Anne</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterised clinically by dementia and progressive memory loss, and pathologically by neuronal degeneration, plaques (insoluble &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) protein) and neurofibrillary lesions (abnormally phosphorylated tau protein). The mechanisms by which cells die in AD remain largely unknown and controversial. There is some evidence to suggest that cell death in AD brains may occur by apoptosis, and that A&#946; might be involved in this process. Apoptosis, a type of cell death characterised by distinct morphological and biochemical features, is often the result of 'programmed cell death' (PCD). Many gene families have been proposed to be involved in the PCD pathway, including the caspase family, inducible transcription factor (ITF) family (including Jun, Fos and Krox genes), and members of the Bcl-2 gene family (including the death promoting gene Bax). It is possible, therefore, that some of these genes may play a role in cell death in AD. The hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in AD, showing cell loss mainly in the CA1-2 pyramidal cell layer. In this thesis, the hippocampus from AD and Control cases has been examined for markers of apoptosis and genes thought to be involved in PCD. In addition, the actions of A&#946;, human amylin (a structurally similar protein to A&#946;) and the A&#946; precursor protein (APP) have been examined in cell culture in an attempt to elucidate their mechanisms of action and relate this to the pathogenesis of AD. AD hippocampi showed increased DNA fragmentation as assessed by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL), but TUNEL-positive cells in AD generally did not exhibit 'typical' apoptotic morphology, and there was no evidence of the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. This indicates that 'typical' apoptosis may not be the predominant cell death mechanism in AD. However, there was some evidence of atypical 'broken' nuclei, which may represent a form of apoptosis that presents with a different morphology in aging tissue. This study found no conclusive evidence of increased expression of Fos or Jun family members in the CA1 region of AD hippocampi, however there were increased levels of the putative 'apoptosis-specific protein' and krox24 mRNA in this area which could be related to the cell death. There was no change in Bax expression in the CA1 region of AD brains (although increased Bax expression was observed in this region in a rat hypoxic-ischemia model where the CA1 neurons die by apoptosis). However, there was a decrease in Bax expression in the granule cells of AD hippocampi which could be related to the relative preservation of these cells in AD. Bax and ITF expression was observed in tangles, senile plaques and Hirano bodies in AD hippocampi, which may be related to the formation of these features and/or the pathogenesis of AD. There appeared to be changes in the cellular location of proteins in post-mortem tissue that made determination of ITF levels extremely difficult. In addition, patterns of ITF expression differed when different antisera directed at the same protein were used. These observations indicate that caution must be exercised when studying protein changes in post-mortem tissue. Application of insoluble A&#946; to cultured cells, and overexpression of APP or familial AD-linked APP mutants in cultured cells, did not cause toxicity or alter c-Jun gene expression. However, human amylin was toxic to cultured cells, and had different effects on c-Jun gene expression depending on the cell type. This shows that structurally similar proteins do not always act by a similar mechanism, and that care must be taken when choosing a cell culture system to study disease-related events. The finding that neither insoluble A&#946; nor APP/AD-linked APP mutants caused acute toxicity to cultured cells, coupled with the lack of relationship between TUNEL staining and A&#946; deposits in post-mortem AD tissue, indicates that deposited insoluble A&#946; and/or increased amounts of A&#946; may not represent the toxic event in AD. This thesis provides a detailed investigation of several factors that could be involved in the cell death process in the hippocampus in AD. The results presented find no conclusive evidence for &#8216;classical&#8217; apoptosis and/or increased ITF expression in the hippocampus in AD, but the changes in expression of krox24 mRNA, &#8216;apoptosis-specific protein&#8217; and Bax suggest that programmed cell death may well be a mechanism which is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences::320503 Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The studies of novel regulators of bone cell function</field><field name="creator">Lin, Jian-Ming</field><field name="description">The current study investigates novel factors in bone cell biology by using both in vitro and in vivo models. The results show that murine receptor activator of nuclear factor-KB ligand (muRANKL) and rat RANKL (rRANKL) stimulated, while human osteoprotegerin (hOPG) inhibited, 45Ca release and [3H]-thymidine incorporation in rat calvarial organ cultures, osteoclastogenesis from mouse bone marrow cultures and bone resorption in rat isolated mature osteoclast assays. Interestingly, truncated rRANKL(246-318) became an antagonist for non-truncated rRANKL in isolated osteoclast assays. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-8a at 25 ng/mL or greater potently stimulated osteoblast proliferation and mildly inhibited osteoblast differentiation. An autocrine mechanism may be involved in the regulation of osteoblasts based on detection of the expression of FGF-8 in these cells. Osteoclastogenesis was significantly reduced by FGF-8a at 0.05&#8212; 25 ng/mL, while the ratio of RANKL/OPG was elevated by this agent. &#945;-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH) markedly stimulated both osteoblast proliferation (at 10-9 M or greater) and osteoclastogenesis (at 10-8 M or greater) in vitro. The stimulatory effect on osteoclasts was associated with the increased ratio of RANKL/OPG. Systemic administration of &#945;-MSH resulted in a decrease in trabecular volume in tibiae. &#945;-MSH also stimulated canine chondrocyte proliferation, but had no direct interaction with mature osteoclasts. Milk basic fraction (MBF)-1, MBF-2, milk acidic fraction (MAF)-1 and MAF-2 were found to be mitogenic to osteoblasts in vitro. While MAF-1 inhibited and MAF-2 stimulated bone resorption in calvarial cultures, the peptic hydrolysates of the both fractions showed inhibitory effects in this model. Among the individual components identified from the milk fractions, lactoferrin was found to be an interesting novel anabolic factor, potently stimulating osteoblast proliferation at 1-10 &#181;g/mL or greater in both isolated osteoblast and calvarial organ cultures, as well as potently inhibiting osteoclast formation from bone marrow cells via a RANKL/OPG-independent mechanism. In summary, this study has revealed the possibility of the development of a RANKL antagonist through truncation of the molecule. In addition, the osteoblastic and osteoclastic effects of FGF-8a, &#945;-MSH and lactoferrin have been demonstrated for the first time. However, further study is still needed to better understand the mechanisms of their functioning and to evaluate their potential for clinical application.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure, regulation and function of the leukocyte &#946;7 integrins and CG-1</field><field name="creator">Leung, Euphemia Yee Fun</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the structure, regulation and function of the leukocyte &#946;7 integrins and a novel mouse protein termed CG-1. Members of the integrin family of adhesion molecules are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and play fundamental roles in diverse biological processes. The &#946;7 integrins (LPAM-1, HML-1 and M290) appear to play a special role in mucosal immunity and inflammation. They bind to cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) including MAdCAM-1, VCAM-1 and fibronectin which are expressed on inflamed endothelia and epithelia, and thereby contribute to the processes of leukocyte emigration and retention. An analysis of the &#946;7 gene promoter was undertaken to understand the regulation of expression of the &#946;7 integrins on different leukocyte subtypes. Primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis revealed that the start of transcription was confined to nucleotide positions +1 and +4. The 5&#8217; site contains the highly conserved CA motif found at the transcriptional initiation sites of eukaryotic genes. Transient transfection assays revealed that a small 292bp 5&#8217;-flanking region of the &#946;7 gene is responsible for cell-specific transcription. This promoter appears to be very compact with an array of potential and often overlapping cis-elements clustered around the transcription start site. The types of cis-elements in the &#946;7 gene promoter are reminiscent of those found in the transcriptional enhancers of the TCR, CD3, integrin &#945;4 subunit, and integrin Leu-CAM genes, in accord with the predominantly leukocyte-restricted distribution of the &#946;7 integrins in normal cells. However, proximal promoter activity was quite weak, and it is likely that distal enhancer elements are required to drive expression of the &#946;7 gene. The presence of an enhancer region located between nucleotide positions -690 and -397 was detected by both deletion analysis and DNase I hypersensitivity assay using the EL4 cell line. Functional studies of the trans-acting factors which bind the cis-acting elements contained within the &#946;7 promoter will aid in unravelling the signals imparted to leukocytes in blood vessels and in gut-associated lymphoid tissues that regulate M290/HML-1 and LPAM-1 expression. CG-1 is a coiled-coil leukocyte protein that is characterized by having extensive heptad repeats. It is immunologically related to, associated with, or identical to CD100, a cell surface antigen which shares a costimulatory function with integrins. CD100 influences the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells. Complementary DNAs encoding the mouse homologue of CG-1 were obtained by screening various mouse cDNA libraries with a human CG-1 cDNA probe. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of mouse CG-1 displays 83% identity with the human homologue, and the coiled-coil regions have been stringently conserved. CG-1 transcripts are expressed in a diverse range of cell lines and tissues, and are not restricted to haematopoietic cells. A complex pattern of insertions and/or deletions within CG-1 RNAs was revealed by comparison of the sequences of various mouse cDNA clones isolated from different cells and tissues. The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and human CG-1 are similar to the sequence of the chicken cardiac morphogenic protein ES/L30, suggesting that CG-1 and ES/130 are potentially related members of a gene family.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superantigens as vaccine delivery vehicles for the generation of cellular immune responses</field><field name="creator">Loh, Mei San</field><field name="description">The constant battle between pathogen and host has led to substantial diversity and adaptability of the host immune system. Pathogens too, have evolved unique mechanisms to evade their hosts. The production of superantigens is one of these mechanisms. Superantigens are potent T cell mitogens that have the unique ability to bind simultaneously to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). The resulting uncontrolled activation of up to 20% of all T cells and the subsequent cytokine release, can lead to fever, shock and death. Superantigens are not processed intracellularly like conventional antigens but instead bind as intact proteins to MHC class II molecules expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells. On the hypothesis that the unique properties of superantigens may serve useful for vaccine delivery, several bacterial superantigens were selectively mutated at their TCR-binding site with the ultimate goal of creating a safe, non-toxic carrier protein that could target antigen presenting cells by binding to MHC class II. Antigen presenting cells that expressed MHC class II were indeed targeted by the TCR-binding-deficient superantigens. Cellular internalisation of the superantigen into vesicles was observed as early as 30 min. These supcrantigens were also shown to traffic to, and be captured by, the lymph nodes of immunised mice. Using TCR-binding-deficicnt superantigens as vaccine carrier proteins, enhanced antigenicity and immunogenicity of the conjugated MHC class I-restricted peptide antigen. GP33, was observed in a mouse model. In vitro studies revealed up to 200-fold enhancement of antigenicity when GP33 was conjugated to superantigen. Enhanced immunogenicity was also observed in vivo, with conjugates providing protection against Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection after only a single immunisation. These results indicate that modified superantigens are able to safely deliver peptides for cross-presentation, and may serve as a novel mechanism for vaccine delivery.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising boys (and) video gaming: "Communities of Practice"?</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Jennifer D.</field><field name="description">The present investigation aimed to apply Wenger&#8217;s (1998) conceptualisation of the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept (being one concept within the broader framework of social learning theory) to video gaming, based on Gee&#8217;s (2003) suggestion that video gaming could be viewed as a &#8216;community of practice&#8217;. In addition, Paechter&#8217;s (2003a) recommendation that masculinities (after Connell, 1995, and inclusive of a Foucaultian notion of knowledge/power relations), could be additionally conceptualised as &#8216;communities of masculinities practice&#8217; was explored in relation to video gaming. The choice of &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; as the unifying concept for this study was favoured due to the application of the concept to a number of New Zealand, Ministry of Education initiatives. The research project aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept for application to boys (and) video gaming as a model for how the concept might be applied to a range of education-related social learning environments. A total of 284 Year 9 boys (13-14 years old), from five New Zealand schools were surveyed about their video gaming behaviours and understandings, and further 42 boys from a selection of these same schools took part in &#8216;lessons&#8217; to discuss in detail aspects of their video gaming. Evidence supported that; video gaming in itself cannot be conceptualised as a &#8216;community of practice&#8217; because there is no sense of mutual engagement in a joint enterprise in the playing of video games, (that was, there is no evidence to support the conceptual understanding of &#8216;community&#8217; or &#8216;practice&#8217;); and in addition, that while masculinities can be convincingly conceptualised as &#8216;communities of practice&#8217;, it is only when the activity of video gaming is seen as a resource within the shared repertoire of the &#8216;communities of masculinities practice&#8217;, in which masculinities, both hegemonic and less hegemonic are performed and reproduced, that video gaming can be linked with the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to where the conceptual and analytical lens offered by the &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; concept, appear to be more applicable to the world of boys and video gaming. Also reiterated is that romanticised notions of &#8216;community&#8217;, applied to the likes of an educational environment but devoid of conceptual foundation, can be little more than rhetoric when not carefully considered and supported by empirical evidence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sympathetic neural control of renal blood flow</field><field name="creator">Leonard, Bridget Louise</field><field name="description">Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) plays an important role in the control of renal hemodynamics and function. It achieves this control by changing the mean levels of activity and/or changing the power of the distinct frequencies that comprise this mean activity. My studies, presented in four parts, investigate how total renal blood flow (RBF) and intrarenal blood flow are controlled by these changes in RSNA. While RSNA and RBF both show oscillations at various frequencies, the functional significance and regulation of these oscillations is not well understood. To establish whether the strength of these oscillations is under differential control I measured the frequency spectrum of RSNA and RBF following volume expansion in conscious rabbits. At least 6 days prior to experiments animals underwent surgery to implant an electrode for recording renal nerve activity and a flow probe for recording RBF. Volume expansion resulted in a 25 &#177; 5% decrease in mean RSNA, paralleled by an increase in RBF. Renal denervated rabbits did not show an increase in RBF with volume expansion. Spectral analysis of the different frequencies in RSNA showed oscillations in RSNA between 0.2 to 0.4 Hz were selectively decreased following volume expansion (14 &#177; 3 to 6&#177;1% of total power in RSNA at &lt; 3Hz). A corresponding decrease in the strength of oscillations in RBF at this frequency was also seen (20 &#177; 6 to 8 &#177; 2%). In contrast the strength of respiratory (0.8 to 2.0 Hz) and cardiac (3 to 6 Hz) related rhythms did not change with volume expansion. These results show that selective changes in the different frequency components of RSNA can occur. While RSNA plays a significant role in the regulation of RBF, little is known about the role renal nerves may play in the control of regional kidney blood flows i.e. cortical and medullary blood flow (CBF and MBF respectively). This is an important question as the control of blood flow to the renal medulla has been shown to be critical in the long-term control of arterial pressure, chiefly through its influence on tubular reabsorption of salt and water. If renal nerves are involved in the control of medullary blood flow then they may also have a role in long-term arterial pressure regulation. My aim was to investigate the role RSNA may have in the regulation of both CBF and MBF. In a series of experiments, using pentobarbitone anaesthetized rabbits, I electrically stimulated the renal nerves whilst simultaneously recording RBF, CBF, and MBF. Three sequences of stimulation were applied, 1) varying the amplitude of stimulation, 2) varying the frequency of stimulation and 3) stimulation with a modulated sinusoidal pattern which allows determination of the frequency response characteristics of each flow. Increasing amplitude or frequency of stimulation progressively decreased all flow variables. RBF and CBF responded similarly, but MBF responded less. For example, 0.5 V stimulation decreased CBF by 20 &#177; 9% but MBF fell by only 4 &#177; 6%. The amplitude of oscillations in all flow variables was progressively reduced as the frequency of sinusoidal stimulation was increased. An increased amplitude of oscillation was observed at 0.12 and 0.32 Hz in MBF, and to a lesser extent RBF, but not CBF. MBF therefore appears to be less sensitive than CBF to the magnitude of RSNA, but more able to respond to these higher frequencies of neural stimulation. These results show that regional renal blood flows may be differentially regulated by RSNA and indicate a role for RSNA in the control of MBF. To further investigate the effects of RSNA on intrarenal blood flow I performed another series of experiments in which I reflexly increased RSNA while simultaneously recording CBF and MBF. I exposed pentobarbitone anesthetized, artificially ventilated rabbits to graded reductions in inspired 02 content. A separate group of animals with denervated kidneys underwent the same protocol. Graded hypoxia (16, 14, 12 and 10% inspired 02) progressively reduced arterial 02 partial pressure and increased RSNA (by 8 &#177; 3, 44 &#177; 25, 62 &#177; 21 and 76 &#177; 37% respectively compared with air) without affecting MAP. This was accompanied by progressive reductions in CBF (by 2 &#177; 1, 5 &#177; 2, 11 &#177; 3 and 14 &#177; 2% respectively) in intact but not denervated rabbits. MBF was unaffected by hypoxia in either group. Thus, reflex increases in RSNA cause renal cortical vasoconstriction, but not at vascular sites regulating MBF. Taken together results from both these studies provide strong evidence that MBF is less sensitive to the vasoconstrictor influence of RSNA than is CBF. However, larger, chronic increases in RSNA, such as occur in heart failure, could be associated with decreases in MBF. This may implicate RSNA in the long-term control of arterial pressure. The 0.3 Hz oscillation in RSNA, and thus MAP, is intermittent in its presence. In a final series of experiments I studied the underlying reasons for the presence or absence of the 0.3 Hz oscillation. Using conscious animals I studied the oscillation under a range of sympathetic stimulants. I was unable to induce an oscillation in MAP at 0.3 Hz and propose reasons for this. To allow further analysis, I performed a second set of experiments in which I induced the oscillation in RBF by electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve. I found that large amplitude oscillations in baroreceptor stimulation were required to induce oscillations in RBF and MAP. I speculate on what this may tell us about the nature of the slow oscillation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding leukaemogenesis: towards identification of leukaemia enhancers and suppressors through zebrafish genetics</field><field name="creator">Kalev-Zylinska, Maggie Lucy</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art education in New Zealand: issues of culture, diversity and difference</field><field name="creator">Smith, Jill (Jill Elizabeth)</field><field name="description">New Zealand is becoming increasingly multicultural and its school population progressively diverse. Ministry of Education policy documents present policy and curriculum direction which acknowledge the value of New Zealand's bicultural identity and multicultural society. These policies impact on the field investigated, secondary school art education. Developed under the influence of neo-liberal political theory, which emphasises economic sustainability rather than principles of social justice, they raise issues of the position and value of art education in the contemporary age of globalisation. Cultural theorists claim that schooling has a responsibility to educate for an equitable democratic society. Multicultural art education theorists argue that art education can make a significant contribution towards democratic practices. Evident in the literature from within New Zealand is critical, theoretical and philosophical debate on the framing of the arts curriculum and its socio-political and cultural contexts. There is no evidence, however, of practical investigation into how secondary school art teachers are interpreting and implementing the visual arts discipline in the arts curriculum or exploring the underlying issues of cultural diversity in an increasingly multiculturalised society. The thesis is underpinned by a critique of interpretations of culture, diversity and difference, an interrogation of pedagogical practices for culturally inclusive art education, and a critical analysis of curriculum policy. The research investigated, through case study fieldwork in secondary schools, the extent to which policy and curriculum directives and art education practice take into account the ethnic diversity and cultural differences of students from diverse cultures living in a contemporary globalised world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factors in the ischaemic heart</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Kenneth George</field><field name="description">Cardiac muscle has very limited ability to regenerate following injury. Loss of muscle due to myocardial infarction (MI) is therefore compensated for by hypertrophy of the surviving cardiac muscle. Deposition of inflexible scar tissue in the infarct zone leads to subsequent dysfunction of the heart, often culminating in chronic morbidity and eventual death due to heart failure. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) are members of a family of insulin-related peptides involved in tissue development, repair and replacement. Their involvement in these roles has been clearly demonstrated in skeletal muscle, but remains unclear in cardiac muscle. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the insulin-like growth factor axis following induced MI in sheep, in order to determine the relationship between time-based changes in the myocardium and insulin-like growth factor levels, and subsequently to determine the therapeutic effect of GH or IGF-I treatment on cardiac function following MI. To achieve the aims of the thesis, a model of MI was developed from the existing cardiology technique of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Using this model, MI was induced in adult ewes by selected coronary artery occlusion under fluoroscopic guidance. Subsequently, the model was further developed into one of stable heart failure, utilising serial microembolisations targeted by echocardiography. Results showed that, in the cardiomyocytes bordering the infarct, IGF-I mRNA, protein and receptor binding increased, whereas IGF-II mRNA and protein levels did not vary, although IGF-II receptor binding increased. Following these findings, IGF-I levels were manipulated by subcutaneous injections of either growth hormone or IGF-I, and by intra-pericardial IGF-I delivery via catheter. Results showed that neither growth hormone nor subcutaneous IGF-I were able to effect an improvement in cardiac function, although there were indications that a longer duration of treatment with subcutaneous IGF-I might have done so. Intra-pericardial IGF-I, however, resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in cardiac function. In conclusion, surviving cardiomyocytes at the infarct border show marked changes in IGF-I localisation, production and specific binding, indicating that IGF-I is directly involved in post-infarct events, possibly in the maintenance of cardiac function by the induction of hypertrophy. Delivery of IGF-I directly into the pericardium results in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction which is sustained after cessation of treatment. Such a result indicates that IGF-I may have a role as a therapy in the failing heart.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mutation in the gene encoding osteoprotegerin causes the severe bone disease Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia</field><field name="creator">Middleton-Hardie, Catherine</field><field name="description">Genetic analysis of a large family with Familial Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia, a rare autosomal recessive bone disease, identified linkage to a region of chromosome 8q that contains the gene for osteoprotegerin (OPG), a key regulator of bone remodelling. Sequencing of this gene in members of the family identified an in-frame 3 base pair deletion resulting in the deletion of an aspartate residue at position 182, within the critical TNF-receptor-like region. Wild-type and mutant OPG cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-His vector and expressed in HEK293 cells. Conditioned media samples containing the recombinant proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit bone resorption in a neonatal murine calvarial organ culture. Conditioned medium containing wild type OPG (wtOPG) inhibited bone resorption, whereas the conditioned medium containing the mutant protein (OPG&#8710;D182) had no effect. Subsequently, the peptides were tested in a murine bone marrow osteoclastogenesis system. In this assay, OPG&#8710;D182 had significantly lower activity than wtOPG. These results indicate the deletion of aspartate 182 impairs the ability of OPG to inhibit osteoclast formation and activation. The ability of wtOPG and OPG&#8710;D182 to bind RANKL has been investigated using a rRANKL-GST pulldown system. These experiments demonstrated the OPG&#8710;D182 had reduced ability to bind RANKL compared to wtOPG. A kinetic study using the surface plasmon resonance technology of BIAcore&#8482; revealed the RANKL binding affinity of OPG&#8710;D182 is lower than that of wtOPG. Altered processing of OPG&#8710;D182 causes hyperglycosylation in comparison to wtOPG. Glycosylation was shown to be important for the function of full-length OPG, probably due to a requirement of glycosylation for correct folding. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two glycosylation sites that contribute to the hyperglycosylation of OPG&#8710;D182. Glycosylation at one of these sites has potential structural implications by preventing disulphide bond formation and correct protein domain folding. The research highlights the effects of a single amino acid deletion on the structure and function of OPG. The deletion of aspartate 182 is a detrimental mutation that results in the severe phenotype seen in the patients, confirming the crucial role of OPG in normal bone physiology in humans.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of ryanodine receptor expression in the rat cochlea</field><field name="creator">Morton-Jones, Rachel</field><field name="description">Increases in intracellular Ca2+ play a central role in cochlear function. The ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular Ca2+ release channel, a ubiquitous element of Ca2+ signalling, has been implicated in the regulation of sound transduction and auditory neurotransmission. Despite this, the molecular basis underlying RyR-mediated Ca2+ signalling in the cochlea has been limited. This thesis investigates the molecular and functional characterisation of RyR expression in the cochlea. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 isoform mRNA transcripts in the rat cochlea and also in the spiral ganglion. Localisation of RyR protein revealed differential expression of these isoforms in the cochlea. Strong RyR immunolabelling for RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 were detected in the spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) cell bodies. RyR3 labelling extended to the synaptic terminals innervating the inner and outer hair cells. RyR2 expression also occurred in the inner hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Cells associated with ion homeostasis in the cochlea were also labelled, including RyR1 in spiral limbus interdental cells, and RyR2 and RyR3 in spiral prominence epithelial cells and stria vascularis basal cells. In the SGN cell bodies, confocal imaging of Ca2+ store release confirmed the presence of a functional RyR-gated Ca2+ store. Superfusion of glutamate and &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) evoked large Ca2+ responses in the SGN cell bodies that were dependent upon Ca2+ entry. However, subsequent depletion of SGN RyR-gated Ca2+ stores substantially reduced the glutamate- and AMPA-induced Ca2+ responses, demonstrating that the majority of the Ca2+ signal derived from RyR-gated Ca2+ stores via Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release. Involvement of the AMPA/Kainate-type glutamate receptor was confirmed by elimination of glutamate- and AMPA-induced Ca2+ responses with an AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist. These findings support a role for RyR in the regulation of auditory neurotransmission, sound transduction and cochlear electrochemical homeostasis. These data also demonstrate coupling between somatic AMPA-type glutamate receptors and RyR-gated Ca2+ stores, which is likely to influence auditory neurotransmission.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathophysiology of fetal asphyxia: factors that influence the severity and distribution of neuronal damage</field><field name="creator">Mallard, Eva Carina</field><field name="description">Perinatal asphyxia is thought to be a major cause of subsequent neurological deficits. Pathological studies suggest that many of these events occur before birth. However, the relationship between specific prenatal events and neurological outcome is not clear. This thesis tested the hypothesis that certain fetal factors play a role in determining the severity and distribution of neuronal loss following in utero asphyxia. Chronically instrumented fetal sheep at three different gestational ages; midgestation (90d), late-gestation (120-130d) or near term (&gt; 135d) were subjected to either a single or repeated insult. The insult consisted of an episode of either systemic asphyxia (umbilical cord occlusion) or cerebral ischaemia (carotid artery occlusion). The fetal parietal cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), cortical impedance (CI) indicating intracellular edema, blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and frequent fetal blood gases and metabolites were measured. Three days after the insult, histopathological analysis or immunohistochemistry was performed to determine neuronal loss and specific neurotransmitters respectively. Transient (10min) occlusion of the umbilical cord in late-gestation fetuses, resulted in severe fetal asphyxia, hypotension (24&#177;5mmHg, p&lt;0.01), bradycardia (72&#177;14bpm, p&lt;0.001), depressed EEG activity (-17&#177;2dB, p&lt;0.001) and intracellular edema. The intracellular edema resolved within 27&#177;6min, whereas the EEG activity was depressed for 5&#177;2h, despite rapid recovery of pO2. Neither seizures or infarction were observed. The degree of hypotension, increase in CI, lactate and recovery of post-asphyxial EEG intensity were more marked in 135d fetuses compared with the midgestation fetus (p&lt;0.01). Neuronal loss, which was only observed in the older group, was predominantly in the hippocampus and associated with the severity of hypotension during occlusion. Repeated episodes of cerebral ischaemia, altered the distribution of neuronal loss compared with single insults, inducing damage mainly in the striatum. The frequency of the insults determined the severity of the damage. Similarly, recurrent episodes of fetal asphyxia induced predominantly striatal neuronal loss. Each occlusion resulted in fetal hypoxia and bradycardia accompanied by increased T/QRS ratio as noted on the ECG. Progressively severe hypotension and lactic acidosis developed during successive occlusions. The EEG was depressed and CI increased with each occlusion. After the asphyxial episodes, blood pressure and heart rate returned to normal, while the T wave was inverted for 310&#177;60min. The EEG remained depressed for 90&#177;10min and intermittent seizures developed at 3.3&#177;0.6h after the last occlusion. The extent of neuronal loss correlated with the degree of hypotension, increase in T/QRS ratio, duration of post-asphyxial EEG depression and number of seizures. Immunohistochemical analysis showed loss of striatal GABAergic projection neurons. These findings demonstrate that certain prenatal factors, such as neurological maturation, pattern of the insult and cardiovascular instability can influence neuronal outcome following fetal asphyxia. An isolated brief episode of asphyxia can lead to selective hippocampal neuronal loss, while repeated insults induce predominantly striatal damage. These distributions of neuronal loss may be associated with postnatal sequelae such as learning disorders and cerebral palsy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemoprevention studies with Pacific foodstuffs: effects on xenobiotic metabolising enzymes and cytotoxicity</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Rachel A.

For the chronic study, male Fischer 344 rats were fed defined AIN-76A diet &#177; 10% foodstuff (taro, kumara, pineapple, or coconut), with or without IQ (300ppm for 52 weeks). In the acute study, male Fischer 344 rats were fed defined AIN-76A diet and gavaged with IQ (20 mg.kg-1, 3 days). Pathology was observed and changes in enzyme activities and expression examined. Simple fractionation of the foodstuffs was also performed and their effects on cell viability and enzyme expression were investigated in vitro in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and immortal human HT29 and P388 cells. In the liver, acute exposure to IQ affected enzymes consistent with complex xenobiotic response element / glucocorticoid response element activation, whereas chronic exposure was consistent with activation of the antioxidant response element. No pattern of enzyme change was obvious in other organs. Inclusion of South Pacific foodstuffs in the diet at 10% had a marked effect on enzyme activity in the liver and lung, although there was no consistent pattern for enzyme changes for a particular enzyme or foodstuff. Enzyme activity in the colon was below the level of detection. There was a complex response when IQ was included with the foodstuffs, which did not resemble the response to either IQ or the foodstuff alone. Fractionation of foodstuffs and in vitro cell-based work did not reveal the presence of compounds in the foodstuffs that explained the complex changes in pathology or XME observed in vivo. The interaction between foodstuffs and IQ in the body was complicated. This may be explained by the presence of many compounds within the foodstuffs that have additive, synergistic, or inhibitory actions on many pathways in the body and underlines the complexity of using whole foodstuffs, rather than a single, purified constituent, in chemoprevention studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of coercion of patients subject to the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992</field><field name="creator">McKenna, Brian G.</field><field name="description">The use of mental health legislation to determine involuntary treatment for people suffering from mental illness (civil commitment) is a controversial issue, centred on the ability of civil commitment to be coercive by limiting patients&#8217; choice, autonomy and self-determination The intent of the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 was to limit coercion by emphasising informed consent (even if treatment can be administered without it); recognising the civil rights of patients subject to civil commitment; and encouraging involuntary treatment in the least restrictive environment (the community). However, there is no evaluative research that considers the extent to which patients subjected to the legislation perceive coercion. The aim of this thesis was to consider the extent to which mental health legal status equates with coercion, the factors that impact on patients&#8217; perceptions of coercion and the factors that have the potential to ameliorate such perceptions. Empirical cross-sectional comparison studies, measuring perceived coercion using a validated psychometric measure, were undertaken at three points during the implementation of civil commitment. These involved a comparison between involuntary and voluntary patients admitted to acute inpatient psychiatric services, a comparison between involuntary patients admitted to acute psychiatric inpatient services and involuntary patients admitted to forensic psychiatric services, and a comparison between involuntary and voluntary outpatients. The studies found that legal status is only a broad index of the amount of coercion perceived by patients. Some voluntary patients feel coerced and some involuntary patients found the process non-coercive. Perceptions of coercion cannot be fully explained by socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, or by coercive incidents that occur throughout the process of civil commitment. Rather, the perceptions relate to the total experience of civil commitment, including the interactive processes with clinicians. In this regard, involving patients in proceedings that are experienced as fair and just (procedural justice) has a marked impact on reducing patients&#8217; perceptions of coercion. In conclusion, the findings are underscored by legal requirements and ethics in order to provide clinical guidelines for implementing civil commitment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of insulin-like growth factors in the fetus</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Mark Hope</field><field name="description">Fetal substrate supply is important in the regulation of fetal growth. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), insulin and placental lactogen (PL) may be important mediators in fetal growth regulation. However, nutritional regulation of circulating concentrations of IGFs, their binding proteins (IGFBPs) and PL during fetal life is poorly understood. The objective of this thesis is to characterise the influence of nutrition on the regulation of these hormones in the fetal circulation. Pregnant ewes were starved for 72 h and then refed for 48 h. After 48 h starvation fetuses were infused with glucose, amino acids or insulin while maternal starvation continued. Other fetuses of fed mothers were infused with recombinant oPL or IGF-I for 24 h. Fetal blood glucose, plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin concentrations all fell on maternal starvation. Fetal plasma IGF-I and insulin concentrations returned to near control values on fetal infusion of glucose or insulin but not amino acids suggesting glucose had a more important role than amino acids in plasma IGF-I regulation and that insulin may have mediated the effect of glucose. Fetal plasma IGF-II concentrations returned to control values on fetal infusion of glucose, but not insulin. Thus fetal plasma IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations appear to be regulated differently by fetal glucose and insulin. Fetal plasma IGFBP-1 and Bp-2 levels increased, while fetal plasma IGFBP-3 and type 2 receptor levels decreased, on maternal starvation. Fetal infusion of glucose or insulin returned fetal plasma IGFBP-1 to near control levels. All fetal plasma IGFBPs were near control levels after maternal refeeding. Fetal plasma IGFBPs and type 2 IGF receptor levels were influenced by nutrition but IGFBP-2, Bp-3 and the circulating type 2 IGF receptor appear to be at least partly regulated by factors other than glucose and insulin. In a separate experiment fetal plasma IGF-I concentrations increased on IGF-I infusion to fetuses whose mothers were on a low plane of nutrition but did not increase in fetuses whose mothers were on a high plane of nutrition suggesting that increases in fetal plasma IGFBP concentrations on maternal starvation or undernutrition may increase fetal plasma IGF-carrying capacity. Plasma concentrations of PL in fetuses whose mothers had been on a high plane of nutrition was higher during starvation than in fetuses whose mothers had been on a low plane of nutrition. Fetal plasma PL concentrations increased 3-fold on maternal infusion of glucose at the end of starvation but was unaffected by fetal infusion of glucose at a lower rate. Fetal plasma PL responses to starvation were influenced by prior nutritional status. The rate of glucose infusion appears to determine the occurrence of a fetal plasma PL response. Fetal blood amino acid nitrogen (AN) concentrations fell on fetal infusion of oPL but fetal blood glucose, plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin concentrations were unaffected. PL does not appear to have a role in the endocrine regulation of the IGFs in fetal sheep but may influence fetal amino acid metabolism. In these studies the fetal plasma concentrations of the IGFs, insulin, PL and plasma levels of IGFBP-1 to -4 have been demonstrated to be regulated by fetal substrate supply. These experiments provide further evidence that these hormones may be mediators in the regulation of fetal growth by fetal substrate supply.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of nuclear lipid signalling in adipocyte differentiation</field><field name="creator">O'Carroll, Simon J. (Simon Joseph)</field><field name="description">The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is one of the most intensely studied biological processes and has led to the understanding of a number of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. The nuclear phosphatidyl inositol (pl) signalling pathway, centred around the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC) &#946;I has been demonstrated to be involved in a number of cellular processes such as mitogenesis and differentiation. Recently components of another lipid signalling pathway, that involving prostaglandins, have also been shown to localise at or within the nucleus. To date, there have been no reports demonstrating the role of either of these nuclear pathways during the differentiation of adipocytes. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line was used to study the role of nuclear pI and prostaglandin lipid signalling in adipocyte differentiation. In Chapter 3 data is presented to show that two phases of nuclear PLC &#946;l activity occur during adipocyte differentiation. The first phase occurs within minutes of differentiation being induced, is regulated by the actions of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) l/2 and protein kinase c (pKC) &#945;, and is involved in the mitotic clonal expansion phase of differentiation. The second phase of activity occurs from day 2 of differentiation, is regulated independently of ERK 1/2 and pKC &#945; and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle factors cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4. In Chapter 4 I investigate the nuclear localisation of prostaglandin synthases, how their localisation is altered by differentiation, and the role of these enzymes in adipocyte differentiation is characterized through inhibitor studies. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES), prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), lipocalin prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) are localised to the nuclear membrane and their localisation changes during differentiation. The COX 1 and2 enzymes also localise within the nucleus and this COX 1 localisation appears to be cell cycle dependent. COX 2 is functionally coupled to mPGES and PGIS and plays a role in adipocyte differentiation as inhibition of COX 2 with a specific inhibitor (NS 398) completely blocks adipocyte differentiation. COX 1 is functionally coupled with L-PGDS and appears to be involved in lipid metabolism as the inhibition of COX 1 with a specific inhinitor (SC 560) partially blocks lipogenesis. In Chapter 5, I investigate the localisation of prostaglandin receptors in the differentiation process. 3T3- L1 cells express the prostaglandin E2 (EP4) receptor, prostaglandin F2&#945; (FP) receptor and the prostaglandin D2 (DP) receptor but these do not have a nuclear localisation. Activation of the DP receptor is involved in lipid metabolism as the DP receptor antagonist, BW A868C, partially inhibits lipogenesis. lnternalisation of prostaglandins appears to be necessary for differentiation to occur fully as treatment of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the anionic transport inhibitor bromocresol green (BCG) partially inhibits carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) induced differentiation and completely inhibits that caused by cyclopentenone prostaglandins. Thus, nuclear lipid signalling pathways appear to play a role in the process of adipocyte differentiation and a proper understanding of these pathways may lead to a better understanding of fat cell development and the role it plays in obesity and its related diseases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening and clinical detection of alcohol disorder in general practice</field><field name="creator">McMenamin, John</field><field name="description">Aim: This thesis reports on the implementation of key alcohol research findings to the screening and clinical detection of alcohol risk and disorder in a general practice. it aims to provide a literature review which will explain the nature of alcohol risk and disorder, why alcohol screening is necessary, and how this screening could be undertaken in general practice using a model of screening by healthcheck. Alcohol risk is presented as the likelihood of an individual to develop alcohol-related complications. Definitions of alcohol disorder are discussed and the reasons for adopting the DSM111R criteria explained. A study is reported in which healthcheck screening is used to improve detection of alcohol risk and disorder in the author&#8217;s general practice. Selected cases are presented to highlight particular issues relevant to alcohol in general practice. The study findings are discussed with reference to the literature review and recommendations on the use of the healthcheck Screening model in general practice presented. Method: All English language medical journals reporting alcohol-related research were identified by contents review (specialist alcohol and New Zealand journals), medline search (using keywords and related articles/author-specific searching) or cross.referencing from other reports. other alcohol-related professional reports were identified from library searches or obtained from original sources. From the literature review, a format was developed for the healthcheck questionnaire which included a brief alcohol screen. This brief questionnaire included three questions on consumption of alcohol, and two questions identifying concern about alcohol use, modified from screening questionnaires available at the start of the study, particularly the Canterbury Alcohotism Screening Test (CAST) and the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST). Adult patients registered with the practice were offered a personal invitation by the doctor to attend a healthcheck appointment. Recruitment was undertaken over a 3 year period for 30-69 year olds (754 eligible patients), and a 5 year period for 18-29 year olds (339 eligible patients). Patients attending the healthcheck completed a self-administered questionnaire which was reviewed by the practice nurse, selected examination items performed, and the results were discussed with the patient by the doctor. Alcohol risk was assessed and laboratory tests arranged if appropriate with follow-up appointment offered to those requiring further alcohol assessment. Patients were classified at increased risk by reported consumption, and diagnosed with alcohol disorder by DSM111R criteria (alcohol abuse or dependence). At the completion of each study period, the clinical notes of all patients in the study were reviewed to determine the screening rate and to review all recorded alcohol information including clinical indicators of alcohol disorder, alcohol risk for all screened patients, and the effect of screening on the prevalence of alcohol disorder. Results: Alcohol information was obtained on 851 of 1093 study patients (78%). Screening increased the detection of alcohol disorder from 4% (44 patients) to 8% (84 patients). clinical detection of alcohol disorder was associated with physical, psychological and social factors. Clinical factors most commonly included abnormal liver function tests, gastro-intestinal symptoms, hypertension, gout and mental health symptoms. Personal and relationship problems were also commonly linked to detection in a clinical context. Recruitment for healthchecks was highest among women (78%) with a high level of screening in both 18-29 year old (80%) and 30-69 year old groups(76%). Recruitment of men (70%) was notably more successful in the 30-69 year old group (85%) than in the 18-29 year old group (44%).As a test for DSM111R alcohol use disOrder, the brief alcohol questionnaire included in the healthcheck had a sensitivity of 0.93, a specificity of 0.85, a positive predictive value of 0.25, and a negative predictive value of 0.99. The questions on alcohol consumption were the most sensitive items, identifying increased risk (intermediate or high risk consumption) in 86% of patients with alcohol disorder. The remaining patients were identified by abnormal liver function tests. A positive screening test (consumption male&gt;20, female &gt;15 standard drinks/week) indicated a 1 in 4 likelihood of alcohol disorder, increasing to 1 in 2 if concern was reported on a screening question, or a liver function tests was abnormal. The healthcheck screening programme increased the detected prevalence of alcohol disorder from 4% to 8%. DSM111R criteria identified 32 patients with alcohol dependence and 52 patients with alcohol abuse. lcDl0 criteria identified 16 patients with alcohol dependence and 54 with harmful use. Nearly half of the patients meeting DSM criteria for disorder (48%) were not drinking at high risk levels (consumption male &gt;50, female&gt;35 standard drinks/week). Case examples drawn from the clinical notes indicated that alcohol information may come from multiple sources, and that classification of this information may be difficult, influenced not only by the completeness of the data available but also by medical interventions and other influences on patient alcohol use over time. Classification was also more difficult in some patients due to the complexity of the particular case. There were advantages identified in classifying disorder including enhanced therapeutic options, increased awareness of related issues and completeness of medical problem lists, although interventions in both risk and disorder were possible without formal diagnosis. Conclusion: there is good evidence in the literature supporting the value of general practice screening for alcohol risk and disorder. This type of screening meets accepted criteria. The importance of alcohol as a health problem is supported by both the prevalence of alcohol-related problems in New Zealand, and the relationship between alcohol and morbidity and mortality. lt is possible to recognise a latent or early symptomatic phase (risk or early abuse/dependence) and it proved possible in the study to collect this information on most patients using the healthcheck screen. There is evidence supporting the value of intervention in heavy drinking and it is reasonable to conclude that intervention in a pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic phase is of more value than waiting until more severe disorder is established. There are good screening tests available including consumption measures, patient questionnaires and laboratory tests. These are relatively inexpensive, generally easy to deliver, and provide sufficient information to determine which patients require further assessment of alcohol use. The use of the brief alcohol screening questionnaire as part of the healthcheck screen proved acceptable to patients in the study and was effective at detecting a high proportion of patients with alcohol disorder. The literature suggests that the AUDIT questions have advantages as screening questions given its international acceptability and its use in several general practice-based New Zealand studies. Although the AUDIT was not available at the time the practice study commenced, it could be incorporated in the health check questionnaire. Laboratory screening has an established supportive role, particularly the selected use of liver function tests. The role of other laboratory tests including carbohydrate-deficient transferring remains unclear and general practice research is required to determine if it has a place in screening and in which patient groups. positive screening tests require further assessment. As indicated in the case examples, this assessment may be undertaken gradually as patients attend the surgery. However, there is benefit if the assessment can be completed more fully. An alcohol assessment package for general practice would be useful. The involvement of practice nurses was essential to the successful delivery of healthcheck screening and this role could be further developed. The practice study shows it was possible to implement evidence-based alcohol screening in a general practice. The healthcheck screening model was a successful method of providing screening though recruitment of younger men could be improved. Uptake of healthcheck screening by other New Zealand general practices would require attention to the organisational factors shown to limit screening and preventive health care delivery.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myocyte injury and altered vascular function in developing myocardial infarcts</field><field name="creator">Sage, Martin David</field><field name="description">The temporal and spatial relationships between altered vascular function and cardiac muscle cell injury at the margins of developing myocardial infarcts were investigated, because such knowledge might provide potential for intervention in the evolution of myocardial infarcts and limitation of their size. Regional myocardial ischaemia was modelled in isolated rabbit hearts subjected to ligation of the ventral interventricular branch of the left coronary artery (0,30,60,120 or 240 minutes duration), the remainder of the heart being continuously perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution. After the experimental ischaemic period, the whole heart was fixed by perfusion with phosphate-buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde which, in preliminary studies, was shown not only to preserve the morphological appearance of cardiac muscle cells, but also to stabilise the distribution of flow through the myocardial blood vessels in the pattern pertaining immediately prior to fixation. Polymerising acrylic resin (L.R. White) was then injected into the vessels of the ischaemic and non-ischaemic regions simultaneously at identical pressures. Resin injected into the ischaemic region contained lead dioxide whilst that injected into the other vessels contained Fat Red 7B dye to allow identification of the source of supply of blood vessels within the heart. Cryofracture, freeze-drying and imaging by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a backscattered electron detector and low vacuum specimen chamber conditions were used. This made possible examination of transmural segments of myocardium spanning the margins of the ischaemic and control ventricular myocardium containing blood vessels filled by resin. SEM showed severe injury of cardiac muscle cells after 60 minutes of ischaemia, as characterised by separation and swelling of some organelles. Earlier ischaemic changes in some cells (focal increase in prominence of t-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) were seen after 30 minutes. There was a transmural progression in development of irreversible injury from the subendocardium to the epicardium between 60 and 120 minutes corresponding to the "wavefront phenonenon". The lateral margins did not show such marked progression and were typically sharply demarcated on a cell-to-cell basis after 60 minutes. An increase in the proportion of functional capillary pathways (from 55% to 85%) in early (30 minutes) ischaemia was succeeded by a profound perfusion defect, corresponding to the "no-reflow" phenomenon, which had a very close temporal and spatial association with severe injury of cardiac muscle cells. Loss of patency was associated with increased proportions of collapsed, compressed capillaries and swollen myocardial cells. This study demonstrated that there is a significant region of myocardium which for a period shows intermediate degrees of myocyte injury (and is thus potentially salvageable) in the subepicardial portion of the developing infarct. Contrary to the claims of various authors similar potentially salvageable lateral "border zones" were neither large nor non-existent. Within 150 microns of the typically abrupt boundary, small discontinuous areas (&lt;20% of this region) showed intermediate degrees of injury, and there was also an increased proportion of non-functional capillaries which were not collapsed or compressed, resulting in a 'low-flow' zone. This narrow lateral zone requires further investigation to determine whether it is static, and thus of negligible size, or whether it moves in advance of infarction and is thus pathogenetically significant.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction experts: An analysis of beginning teacher support in low-socioeconomic New Zealand primary schools</field><field name="creator">Main, Andrea Squirrel</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses induction programmes in low-socioeconomic New Zealand primary schools. A review of the literature indicates that effective induction is integrated and has four main components: pedagogical development, socioemotional support, professional agency, and structured balance. In addition, New Zealand&#8217;s induction programmes are reported to be strong by international standards. Literature is synthesised to create a framework of low-socioeconomic schools as induction experts. Although there have been large-scale analyses of New Zealand induction programmes, there has been no research on the integrated induction systems found in low-socioeconomic primary schools. A mixed-methods approach was used to investigate the support provided for beginning teachers (BTs) in these schools. Methods included a nationwide survey of BTs in low-socioeconomic primary schools, which was mailed to 467 primary and intermediate BTs (44% response rate). Additionally, from all 156 low-socioeconomic primary schools, five exemplar induction programmes were selected and visited throughout the 2007 school year. Survey analysis, success case methods, discourse analysis, and grounded theory methods indicated that induction in these schools is integrated and strong by international standards. Findings indicate that induction programmes in low-socioeconomic schools are pedagogical, supportive, and well structured; however, not all schools focus on enhancing the professional agency of teachers. Exemplar practices such as peer coaching, university partnerships, on-site BT support groups, curricular leadership roles, and formal programme evaluations were found at case study sites. Analyses of factor themes, cluster graphs, frequency-utility matrices, documents, events, and transcripts of meetings and interviews reveal several key findings. First, the Hauora model&#8212;a M&#228;ori concept of balanced pedagogical, spiritual, socioemotional, and physical development&#8212;may be applicable to induction in the New Zealand setting. Second, analyses indicate that low-socioeconomic schools have relatively strong induction programmes. Third, some teachers&#8212;particularly those beginning after the start of the school year or older teachers in their second year of teaching&#8212;may receive varied support. Findings from this research may provide framing for induction programmes in New Zealand as well as for international longitudinal studies of teacher induction models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">induction</field><field name="subject">beginning teacher</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">low socioeconomic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of the integrin beta 7 gene promoter</field><field name="creator">Pandey, Sushil K</field><field name="description">The integrin cell adhesion molecules &#945;4&#946;7 (LPAM-1) and &#945;E&#946;7 (HML-1/M290) reside at the surface of white blood cells, and are critical for establishing and retaining the gut immune system that protects us against intestinal infections. &#945;4&#946;7 contributes to lymphocyte homing to the gut by binding to the vascular addressin MAdCAM-1 expressed on high endothelial venules in Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes and the lamina propria. &#945;E&#946;7 expressed on activated lymphocytes retains lymphocytes at mucosal surfaces by binding to E-cadherin expressed on epithelial cells. Unfortunately &#945;4&#946;7 and &#945;E&#946;7 also contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and potentially multiple sclerosis by mediating the infiltration and retention of immune cells in inflamed tissues. Understanding the biology of integrins and other cell adhesion molecules will allow us to regulate their expression and function in vivo in order to attenuate inflammation. The mechanisms regulating the expression of integrins are poorly understood, but will be essential to unravel if we are to fully exploit newly devised gene therapy approaches to combat inflammation and cancer. The &#946;7 gene promoter was isolated in our laboratory in order to understand the mechanisms directing the expression of &#946;7 integrins. It has previously been shown that TGF&#946;1 stimulates lymphoid expression of &#946;7 and &#945;E RNA transcripts leading to de novo expression of &#945;E&#946;7 at the cell-surface. In contrast, &#945;4 subunit levels representative of the gut homing integrin &#945;4&#946;7 are decreased. This suggests that TGF&#946;1 produced by intestinal epithelial cells may switch migrating lymphocytes from expressing &#945;4&#946;7 to &#945;E&#946;7, thereby facilitating their retention within the gut intraepithelial compartment. This occurs by a mechanism involving the increased binding of nuclear factors to two TGF&#946;1 response regions (TGFBRR) designated TGFBRR 1 and 2 within the mouse &#946;7 gene promoter that had previously been identified as DNAsc I hypersensitivity regions. Here it has been determined that six potential Spl binding sites residing within the &#946;7 gene promoter interact with either Sp1 or both Sp1 and Sp3. TGFBRR1 contains one Sp1 binding cis-element whereas TGFBRR2 contains two such elements. Gene reporter analysis revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 positively and negatively regulate basal &#946;7 gene promoter activity, respectively. Sp1 synergizes with c-Jun, a member of the AP1 group of transcription factors to facilitate DNA-binding and to superactivate &#946;7 gene promoter activity. Deletion analysis revealed that a reporter construct containing a minimal &#946;7 gene promoter encompassing nucleotides (nt) -78 to +95 is more active than a reporter containing nt -690 to +95. Further analysis revealed the presence of a repressor site within nt -105 to -78. Since no TGF&#946;1 responsive Smad cis-elements could be detected within the promoter, it is believed that TGF&#946;1 controls expression of &#946;7 through multiple Sp1 binding sites. The interaction of Sp1 with c-Jun may facilitate &#946;7 gene expression, whereas Sp3 may antagonize Sp1-driven promoter activity. Presumably, other factors yet to be identified maintain tissue specificity. Whether the inhibitor region plays a role in the later process remains to be determined.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the relationship between family involvement and outcome in residential interventions for children</field><field name="creator">Woodfield, Melanie Joslyn</field><field name="description">Family participation in residential interventions for children has been reliably shown to enhance children&#8217;s adaptation to the community following discharge. This finding, however, had predominantly been observed in long-term residential programmes in North America. This thesis examines the influence of family involvement on outcome for children in a short-term residential intervention - the Children&#8217;s Health Camp, in Auckland, New Zealand. This service offers children and families, who may be experiencing social, emotional, physical and/or behavioural challenges, individualised interventions that often include a five-week residential stay. A &#8216;high family involvement&#8217; condition, a community-based programme that followed a residential intervention, was compared with a &#8216;low family involvement&#8217; condition (the traditional residential programme). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups on parent-report measures of child behaviour and parenting practices, although significant improvements in children&#8217;s behaviour (including emotional, social and conduct aspects) for both groups were found. Reasons for the lack of difference between the groups, and the difficulties inherent in conducting outcome research in a residential facility for children are highlighted. Other influences on outcome for children and families, such as residential staff members&#8217; attitudes toward family involvement were also examined. The optimal conditions for successful short-term residential interventions for children are proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Angels at our tables: New Zealanders' experiences of hearing voices</field><field name="creator">Beavan, Vanessa</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the experience of hearing voices in the general New Zealand adult population. This included mapping the topography of voices and the impact of the experience on participants&#8217; lives, exploring participants&#8217; explanatory models, investigating coping strategies and support structures, and developing a model of the essence of hearing voices.  Quantitative and qualitative analyses of questionnaire (n=154) and interview (n=50) data revealed a great diversity of experiences, both within and among participants.  Of all topographical variables significantly related to emotional impact (content, form, duration, intrusiveness and control), voice content was the only significant predictor variable, accurately predicting the emotional response of 93.3% of participants. Overall, participants who valued their voice experiences tended to have spiritual beliefs, a more positive emotional reaction and less contact with mental health services.  In contrast, participants who experienced mostly unwanted voices tended to have biological and/or psychological understandings of their voice experiences, a more negative emotional reaction to them, and increased contact with mental health services.  Participants reported using a vast array of coping strategies, with varying degrees of success. Individualised techniques were reported to be the most effective, followed by setting aside a time to listen to the voices. In terms of help and support, participants called for a model of intervention that accepted their voice experiences as real, took an holistic approach incorporating contextual, cultural and spiritual factors, and worked with voice-hearers, their families and the public to provide information about voice phenomena and normalise the experience.  Using a phenomenological approach, a model of the essential structure of hearing voices is proposed, comprising five components: the content of the voices is personally meaningful to the voice-hearer; the voices have a characterised identity; the person has a relationship with their voices; the experience has a significant impact on the voice-hearer&#8217;s life; and the experience has a compelling sense of reality. The implications of this research include validating voice-hearers&#8217; perspectives of the experience, informing clinical work with voice-hearers, and informing the development of local and national-level services, such as a New Zealand Hearing Voices Network.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Voices</field><field name="subject">Psychosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma</field><field name="creator">Peek, John Charles</field><field name="description">Testicular function is stimulated from the pituitary gland by the gonadotrophic hormones FSH and LH. The testis in turn regulates gonadotrophin secretion by negative feedback. The agents of feedback are steroids, and in addition, probably a protein hormone, which has been given the name inhibin. A method capable of detecting inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma (bSP) was developed. Administration of bSP at the time of castration to five-week old male rats inhibited the post-castration rise of serum concentrations of FSH and LH otherwise seen 24 h later. The degree of inhibition depended on the dose; 0.5 ml bSP or the equivalent amount of bSP-extract always suppressed FSH and LH to levels typical of intact rats. The rats' sensitivity to 0.2 ml bSP varied with the time of year, possibly reflecting seasonal changes in the onset of puberty. The time-course of action of bSP-extract was studied in intact rats. Serum FSH was suppressed 12, 24 and 48 h after a single injection, but not at 3 or 6 h. LH was suppressed at 6, 12, 24 and possibly 48 h.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the leucocyte activation antigens CG-1, CD100 and HML-1</field><field name="creator">Print, Cristin Gregor</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the investigation of three novel leucocyte activation antigens. The investigation began with the characterisation of the &#945;HML-1 integrin subunit. Immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blotting indicated that &#945;HML-1 associates with the &#946;7 integrin subunit to form a typical integrin heterodimer. &#945;HML-1 appears to be post-translationally cleaved into heavy and light chains which remain linked by disulphide bonds. With the aim of isolating the &#945;HML-1 protein, a 45kDa disulphide-linked polypeptide was isolated from leucocytes by two-dimensional non-reducing / reducing gel electrophoresis, and used to raise a polyclonal antiserum. This polyclonal antiserum detected a protein encoded by a cDNA in a &#955;gt11 leucocyte expression library. This cDNA was designated CG-1. It became apparent that CG-1 did not encode the &#945;HML-1 protein, but rather encoded a novel protein which is abundantly expressed in activated leucocytes and reproductive tissues, and weakly expressed in all other tissues examined. The CG-1 gene may be one member of a larger gene family, as two different chicken relatives of CG-1 have been isolated elsewhere. The deduced CG-1 amino acid sequence contains potential transmembrane domains and a potential nuclear localisation signal motif. On the basis of its primary structure the CG-1 protein is expected to form an &#945; helical coiled-coil dimer. A polyclonal antisera raised against a CG-1 - &#946;-galactosidase fusion protein detected a 300kDa protein on the surface of activated human leucocytes. The apparent molecular weight of this protein is halved following the reduction of disulphide bonds, supporting the contention that CG-1 is a disulphide-linked cell-surface dimer. This protein appears to be associated with tyrosine kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay. While participating in the Fifth International Conference on Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens we noted that the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera was remarkably similar to a novel leucocyte protein designated CD100. CD100 is a T lymphocyte co-stimulatory antigen capable of signalling in concert with the T lymphocyte antigen receptor to produce T lymphocyte proliferation. Like the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera, CD 100 was associated with tyrosine kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay, and appeared to be a 300kDa disulphide-linked cell-surface dimer. Anti-CD100 antibodies were able to remove the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera from leucocyte lysates in immunodepletion experiments. This suggests that CG-1 and CD100 are immunologically related, or that CD100 and the protein detected by the anti-CG-1 antisera are physically associated. Current research is directed toward determining the relationship between CG-1 and CD100, and investigating the signalling and costimulatory potential of these molecules. The three leucocyte activation antigens investigated in this thesis all appear to mediate leucocyte transmembrane signalling. All three molecules potentially form the basis of therapeutic approaches for immunoregulation of inflammatory and neoplastic disease.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovine placental lactogen: purification and properties</field><field name="creator">Reddy, Shivanand</field><field name="description">A procedure was developed to purify ovine placental lactogen (oPL) from fetal cotyledonary tissue of late gestation.

CsA is a potent suppressor of T-lymphocyte function and it&#8217;s biological effects have been defined almost exclusively in these terms. However, recent studies in which the agent was shown to exacerbate a T-lymphocyte independent, experimentally induced bacterial infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis), indicated that CsA had effects on host defence mechanisms other than T-lymphocytes. The present study, using animal models, was undertaken to identify the host defence component modified by CsA. Neutrophils are a key component in the early response to infection and the administration of CsA resulted in an increase in the number of these cells in the circulation. When the effect of CsA on the in vitro metabolic activity of neutrophils and their ability to kill microorganisms was investigated, no changes were observed, but the in vivo ability of neutrophils to emigrate from the vasculature to a sterile inflammatory foci was markedly impaired. A model of localised subcutaneous infection was used to determine the effect of this CsA-associated suppression of neutrophil emigration on the ability of the host to mount a response to an infectious challenge. In CsA treated animals, neutrophil accumulation in E. coli infected, subcutaneously implanted sponges was initially suppressed, allowing bacterial numbers to increase rapidly. By 48 hours this powerful bacterial stimulus overrode the suppressive effects of CsA and led to a substantial increase in the size of the neutrophilic infiltrate. This finding of an initially reduced inflammatory response, followed by an increase in the influx of inflammatory cells, provided a possible explanation for the earlier observation that CsA promoted infection and tissue damage in experimental pyelonephritis. The relationship between the effect of CsA on neutrophil emigration and the pathogenesis of experimental pyelonephritis was therefore investigated. When CsA was administered to animals prior to inducing pyelonephritis, the neutrophilic infiltrate was markedly suppressed in the early stages. As predicted, this led to a logarithmic increase in bacterial numbers, the infiltration of large numbers of neutrophils and, ultimately, an exacerbation of tissue damage. Further studies, examining the effects of CsA on neutrophil-mediated inflammatory mechanisms, identified impaired neutrophil-to-endothelial cell adhesion as the most likely explanation for the observed defect in host defences. The integrated nature of cellular defence mechanisms in infectious disease is highlighted by these investigations. when microorganisms invade tissue, even though the number and function of circulating leucocytes may be normal their effective participation in the host response to infection depends on the ability to emigrate from the blood vessels to the site of infection. In summary, the discovery of additional properties of CsA provide an explanation for the patterns of infectious disease in patients treated with CsA, in whom infection with extracellular pathogens is common. It also seems likely that the ability of CsA to suppress neutrophil emigration may contribute to the effectiveness of the agent in the management of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis and psoriasis.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive factors in the maintenance of chronic fatigue syndrome</field><field name="creator">Moss-Morris, Rona Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by persistent debilitating fatigue of uncertain origin. Precipitating and perpetuating factors of this illness are thought to be distinct and the aim of this thesis was to gain greater insight into the role of cognitive factors which may maintain the condition. This work was guided by two central frameworks, the self-regulatory model of illness representations and the cognitive taxonomy of psychopathology. These were used to define the different cognitive constructs and to investigate the way they function as a system to maintain pathological schema and disability in CFS. Three studies using different methodologies were conducted to test the hypotheses. The first employed a descriptive comparative design to ascertain whether CFS patients have unique cognitions which contribute to their disability over time. The sample was comprised of CFS patients without depression (n=39), CFS patients with a concurrent diagnosis of depression (n=14), patients with a primary diagnosis of depression (n=20); and healthy controls (n=38). The groups were matched in aggregate for age, gender, race, and education. Subjects completed the Cognitive Errors Questionnaire-Revised, which measures cognitive distortions relevant to both general and somatic events, and the Illness Perception Questionnaire, which measures the five dimensions of the illness representation in conjunction with other standard measures. Between-group analyses confirmed that the depressed group was distinguished by a low self-esteem, feelings of guilt and self-recriminations, the propensity to make cognitive distortions across all situations, and to attribute their illness to internal, stable and global factors. In contrast, the CFS patients were characterized by low ratings of their current health status, a strong illness identity, external attributions for their illness, and distortion in thinking that were specific to somatic experiences. CFS depressed patients had lower self-esteem than non-depressed patients and had the most pessimistic illness beliefs. A six month follow-up showed that CFS patients' cognitive structures and level of disability remained remarkably stable. Illness identity, serious consequences, somatic errors, and limiting coping accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in CFS patients&#8217; disability scores over time. These results are discussed in terms of their support for both of the cognitive models. CFS patients appeared to have distinct cognitions which were associated with ongoing disability. The subsequent two quasi-experimental studies were conducted in a single laboratory session. The first of these used standardized neuropsychological tests to determine whether psychological variables, particularly somatic focus, interfere with CFS patients&#8217; performance on high load attention tasks. The discrepancy between CFS patients&#8217; subjective reports of concentration and memory difficulties and objective evidence of these deficits was also investigated. The subjects included 25 CFS patients matched for age, gender, and intelligence with two groups of healthy controls. One of these groups underwent a somatic induction procedure as part of the investigation of the effects of somatic preoccupation on attention tasks. The tests included the verbal memory subscales from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a measure of divided attention and speed of information processing. The analyses of the induction data failed to support the validity of this procedure resulting in the somatic control group being dropped from the analysis. Consistent with previous studies the principal deficit in the CFS group appeared to be on the PASAT. The CFS group appeared to be less accurate than healthy controls in their appraisal of their performance, which were related to negative mood rather than objective performance. Depression was also related to high performance expectations in the CFS group, but not the controls. The results did not support the original assumption that somatic preoccupation contributes to neuropsychological difficulties in CFS. However, mood factors were clearly shown to impact on both the objective and subjective experience of symptoms. The aim of the final study was to investigate the concordance between the self-report data collected in study one and information processing biases in CFS. Comparisons of the CFS patients and healthy controls on a modified Stroop attention task and a self-schema memory task, found no evidence of an illness-related bias in CFS patients&#8217; processing of information. Rather, they demonstrated a significant tendency to be distracted by and remember depressed-relevant stimuli. The exception was their propensity to make somatic interpretations. These results are discussed in terms of the defensiveness hypothesis, which proposes that CFS patients&#8217; negative, external illness perceptions and somatic distortions may act as a defence against underlying feelings of low self-esteem. The complex nature of CFS patients&#8217; cognitive structures was revealed and the need to use measures which do not rely on self-reports was clearly demonstrated. These studies provided further support for the central role of cognitive factors and mood in perpetuating CFS.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the inducible transcription factors in status epilepticus-induced delayed neuronal death</field><field name="creator">Preston, Kerin Maree (nee)</field><field name="description">Status epilepticus (SE) is a serious neurological disorder, characterised by prolonged and/or frequent seizure activity. Following SE, a selective and delayed neuronal death (DND) occurs in limbic regions of the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the molecular basis of SE-induced DND in the Wistar rat hippocampus. Following the induction of SE, moribund (i.e. dead/dying) neurons were identified by histological staining, DNA fragmentation and an increase in activated microglia. Clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in apoptotic cell death was also observed to accumulate in the soma and axons of moribund neurons 72-144 hr following SE. Morphological evidence suggested that dying neurons exhibited many of the classical features of apoptosis (i.e. apoptotic body formation, oligo-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and rapid phagocytosis of debris) and therefore raised the possibility that SE-induced DND might be programmed (i.e. requiring de novo protein synthesis). To investigate this hypothesis I have examined the temporal and anatomical expression of a number of proteins which may have a critical role in SE-induced DND. The expression of the inducible transcription factors (ITFs) was examined as they couple extracellular stimulation to the transcription of late effector gene(s), resulting in long-term phenotypical changes in the neuron and therefore, they may couple SE-inducing stimulation with DND. A high correlation was shown between neurons which exhibited a delayed and prolonged ITFP expression and those which were selectively vulnerable to SE-induced DND (e.g. CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate hilar neurons). However, administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin following the induction of SE reduced the ITFPs expression, but resulted in an increase in SE-induced DND after 48 hr. However, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-like immunoreactivity were also shown to attenuate at this time after this procedure. Thus, protein synthesis inhibitors administered following SE may attenuate the level of trophic support and promote cell death. To further investigate the role of the ITFPs in nerve cell death, etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, which is known to facilitate apoptosis was infused into the hippocampus. The results suggested that a complex ITFP expression occurred which preceded nerve cell death. Moreover, this nerve cell death occurred earlier (12-24 hr) and was not anatomically selective. Furthermore, following the etoposide infusion, clusterin was expressed in the hippocampal pyramidal cells, in the dentate hilar neurons and in the dentate granule cells, however the latter exhibited the strongest BDNF-like immunoreactivity. In summary, circumstantial evidence suggests that the ITFPs may form a critical component in the cascade of events which couple toxic stimulation to nerve cell death. However, this thesis demonstrates that the ITFPs have a complex role in DND, as although the ITFPs may be sufficient to induce DND, they may not always be necessary (e.g. in the absence of sufficient trophic support).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the mechanisms of resistance of non-cycling cells to amsacrine and related antitumour drugs</field><field name="creator">Robbie, Maxine Ann</field><field name="description">Several studies have shown that non-cycling cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effects induced by amsacrine (m-AMSA; 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide). This resistance may limit the activity of m-AMSA and related 9-anilinoacridine antitumour agents against solid tumours. The biochemical mechanism(s) for this resistance have been investigated using spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster fibroblast (AA8 cells) in log- and plateau-phase spinner cultures. In early plateau phase most cells entered a growth-arrested state with a G1-G0 DNA content and showed a marked decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxicity after a 1-h exposure to m-AMSA or its solid tumour-active analogue, CI-921. Studies with radiolabelled m-AMSA demonstrated that changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced cell killing were not due to a difference in uptake or retention of drug by log- and plateau-phase cells, and there was no significant metabolism of drug by either log- or plateau-phase cells. Thus, after a 1-h exposure to [3H]-m-AMSA at 37&#176;C, a small proportion (1%) of cell-associated radioactivity was covalently bound to macromolecules, but most of the cell-associated radioactivity represented unchanged m-AMSA. There was no evidence for any oxidative metabolism to reactive quinoidal species in these tumour cells. However, studies with a fluorescence assay for DNA unwinding indicated that plateau-phase cells were 3 to 4 times less sensitive to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage than log-phase cells, and changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage correlated with changes in sensitivity to cell killing by m-AMSA as cell progressed from log to plateau phase. Further studies showed that the decrease in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA stand breakage correlated with a decrease in sensitivity to covalent DNA-protein complex formation in plateau-phase cells after m-AMSA treatment. Combined with evidence that the DNA lesions rapidly disappeared from both log- and plateau-phase cells following the removal of m-AMSA (half-time approx. 4 min), this indicated that the lesions detected by the FADU assay probably arose from the stimulation of DNA-topoisomerase II (topo II) cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA. K+/SDS precipitation assays with [32p] 3&#8217;-end-labelled pBR322 DNA indicated that nuclear extracts containing topo II activity from plateau-phase cells were 3- to 4-fold less sensitive to stimulation of DNA-topo II complex formation by m-AMSA than nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. This change in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA-topo II complex formation was therefore similar to that observed with intact cells. However, P4 unknotting assays indicated that topo II activity in nuclear extracts from plateau-phase cells was only 2-fold lower than that in nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. Resistance to treatment with m-AMSA may therefore reflect a decrease in topo II activity and/or a decrease in sensitivity of topo II enzymes to stimulation of cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA in non-cycling cells.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TATA binding protein in Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="creator">Reid, Suzanne J</field><field name="description">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder, affecting tens of thousands of people in New Zealand, as well as their families and caregivers. AD is characterised by extra cellular &#946;-amyloid (&#946;A) deposition, Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and progressive cortical atrophy. Abnormal protein accumulation is also a common feature of other late onset neurodegenerative diseases, including the heritable polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). One of this family of disorders, SCA17, is caused by an expansion of a polymorphic polyQ repeat in TATA binding protein (TBP), an essential transcription factor. Surprisingly, the wild type TBP repeat length ranges from 25-42, and in Caucasian populations the most common allele is 38, a size large enough to cause HD if within the huntingtin protein. Wild type length TBP accumulates in the disease structures of HD and in at least some of the SCAs. The work described in this thesis investigates the hypothesis that the TATA binding protein (TBP) contributes to AD. This thesis describes the discovery that TBP accumulates in AD brain, localising to NFTs. Also, a proportion of the detectable TBP present is insoluble; a signature of the polyQ diseases. TBP positive structures are shown to be present differentially between patients and its amount and distribution is not directly proportional to that of Tau or &#946;-amyloid positive structures. To investigate if the polyQ repeat length in TBP is associated with AD, alleles were genotyped from two large case/control cohorts. In one cohort, but not the other, older patients carried longer TBP polyQ repeats than controls, and the effect was enhanced when subjects homozygous for the ApoE4 allele were removed from the dataset. Evidence is presented that transcriptional activation by HMGBI, a chromatin associated protein that binds to the polyQ tract within TBP, is altered when co-expressed with TBP carrying 90 glutamines. Taken together this data provides evidence for the hypothesis that the accumulation or misfolding of this polyQ containing protein may be a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the beta7 integrin gene in T cells: role of the MAPK signalling pathways</field><field name="creator">Shafiei, Farhad, 1974-</field><field name="description">Members of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules are involved in cell to cell, cell to ECM, and cell to pathogen interactions, and are of fundamental importance in many biological processes. The &#946;7 integrins &#945;4&#946;7 and &#945;E&#946;7 have evolved to play specialized roles in gut mucosal immunity. &#945;4&#946;7 mediates the homing of lymphocytes to intestinal Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and the lamina propria by binding to the vascular addressin MAdCAM-1 (Fong et al., 1997). &#945;E&#946;7 binds epithelial E-cadherin retaining lymphocytes at the intraepithelial compartment of the mucosa. The expression of &#945;E&#946;7 is induced on migratory lymphocytes by TGF-&#946; secreted by gut enterocytes. The signalling mechanisms responsible for basal and TGF-&#946;-induced expression of &#946;7 integrins are not well understood. Previous studies identified two TGF-&#946;1 response regions in the &#946;7 gene promoter termed TGFBRR-1 and TGFBRR-2 encompassing nucleotides -509 to -398 and -121 to -34. Here, TGF-&#946;1 activation of the &#946;7 gene proximal promoter is shown to be mediated by MAPK family members. TGF-&#946;1 stimulation of TK-1 T cells increased the steady-state mRNA levels of the &#946;7 gene relative to &#945;4 transcripts, and led to enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun. TGF-&#946;1 stimulation induced rapid increases in the binding of nuclear protein complexes to TGFBRR-1 and -2. Sp1 and Sp3 which mediate TGF-&#946;1 signalling were shown to bind to an Sp1 cis-element encompassing nucleotide positions -67 to -60 within TGFBRR-2. The interaction of Sp1 with its cognate binding site was c-Jun dependent. In contrast, there was no evidence for involvement of the Smad proteins. ATF-2 was identified to bind to a region encompassing nucleotide positions -699 to -689 just upstream of TGFBRR-1. Sp1 and ATF-2 expression vectors co-transfected into Sp1-deficient SL-2 cells synergized to drive the activity of a &#946;7 gene luciferase reporter. Mutation of the ATF-2-binding site modestly reduced &#946;7 gene reporter activity. The involvement of c-Jun in TGF-&#946; signalling and interaction of Sp1 with the &#946;7 gene promoter suggested that MAP kinase pathways might mediate &#946;7 gene transcription. Specific chemical inhibitors were used to ascertain which of the three MAPK pathways namely p38, JNK, and ERK were involved. Results obtained by nuclear run-on transcription analysis which measures nascent RNA synthesis showed that both the p38 and JNK pathways regulate &#946;7 gene expression in TK-1 cells, whereas only the p38 pathway regulates &#945;4 gene expression. Thus, treatment of TK-1 cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited the synthesis of &#946;7 transcripts, whereas only SB203580 inhibited the synthesis of &#945;4 transcripts. Conversely, sodium arsenite which induces JNK and p38 upregulated nascent synthesis of &#945;4 and &#946;7 RNA transcripts. SB203580 blocked the binding of nuclear factors to TGFBRR-1, and ATF-2 binding to nucleotide position -699 to -689. Similarly, SP600125 blocked the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to TGFBRR-2, whereas unexpectedly SB203580 enhanced their binding. Furthermore, both SB203580 and SP600125 decreased cell-surface expression of the &#946;7 subunit and SB203580 inhibited TK-1 cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on the expression of nascent &#946;7 RNA transcripts and cell-surface expression of the &#946;7 subunit, suggesting that the ERK pathway is not involved in regulation of &#946;7 gene expression in TK-1 cells. In contrast to the results obtained with TK-1 cells, SB203580, SP600125, and PD98059 each inhibited the nascent synthesis of &#945;4, &#946;7, and &#945;E transcripts in peripheral blood lymphocytes. In conclusion, this study has revealed for the first time that both the p38 and JNK pathways mediate TGF-&#946;1-induced expression of the integrin &#946;7 gene. Expression of the &#946;7 gene is Sp1-dependent, and involves the synergistic cooperation of c-Jun and ATF-2. It is proposed that the p38 and JNK pathways play a role by triggering the activation and translocation of c-Jun and ATF-2 to the nucleus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the crystalline lens in ametropia</field><field name="creator">Scott, Rolene</field><field name="description">When examining the dimensions of the crystalline lens, it is found that some may vary with different types of refractive error. The effects of several of these variations on refractive error are investigated in this thesis. To examine whether lens thickness was significantly different in youth-onset myopes compared with emmetropes, a structural model was developed and tested. No substantial difference was found between the two groups. In both groups of eyes, increased lens thickness was found to contribute significantly to the refractive state of the eye; a thicker lens effectively being a stronger lens. The crystalline lens may play a different role in early adult-onset myopia which develops after normal growth has ceased compared to its role in youth-onset myopia. Cross-sectional data from early adult-onset myopes, youth-onset myopes and emmetropes were evaluated to determine whether lens thickness differed among the refractive error groups. No significant differences were found. However, some early adult-onset myopes and youth-onset myopes were re-evaluated three years after the initial data were collected and a significant increase in mean lens thickness was, found in the group of early adult-onset, myopes. No significant mean lens thickness increase occurred in the group of youth-onset myopes. To evaluate further the contribution of the crystalline lens dimensions to the refractive state of the eye, radii of curvature and. lens thicknesses of a group of anisometropes were examined. Radii were found not to be consistently flatter or steeper in the relatively, more myropic eye compared with the relatively less myopic eye and there was also no significant difference between mean lens thickness of the relatively more myopic eye compared to mean lens thickness of the relatively less, myopic eye. Crystalline lens thickness and radii of curvature were therefore found to play only a minor role in refractive error development, Deeper vitreous chambers and steeper corneal curvatures were found to be the major contributors to myopia.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320900 Optometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breath hydrogen studies of lactose malabsorption in children resident in New Zealand, Cook Islands and Western Samoa</field><field name="creator">Seakins, John Medgley</field><field name="description">Lactose malabsorption (LM) in children was diagnosed by an elevated breath hydrogen (BH) level following a 10g lactose load. A portable gas chromatograph and a semiconductor detector, designed and constructed for use in the Pacific Islands is described. Following verification on known malabsorber and. normal subjects, the technique was used to determine the prevalence of LM in Europeans at Auckland and Rarotonga, and in Samoans at two locations in Auckland and two locations in Western Samoa. The prevalence of LM in Europeans was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher at Rarotonga than at Auckland. For Samoans, the prevalence of LM was significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher in Western Samoa than at Auckland. The prevalence of LM was very highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) related to race. Each child tested for LM filled in a questionaire to determine attitude, consumption of and perceived intolerance to milk, milk biscuits and ice cream. Lactose malabsorption was significantly (p&lt;0.05) correlated to milk consumption and to attitude to dairy products, but not to sex, age, and perceived intolerance. The consumption of dairy products was very highly significantly (p&lt;0.0001) correlated to attitude, and highly significantly (p&lt;0.001) correlated to location and perceived intolerance. There was no significant correlation between consumption and race, sex or age. Perceived intolerance to individual dairy products was significantly correlated to attitude to milk (p&lt;0.0001), milk biscuits (p&lt;0.02) and ice cream (p&lt;0.001). Perceived intolerance was not related to age, sex, race, location or the actual symptoms following the consumption of 10g lactose. The unexpected finding of increased LM in the Pacific Islands, was investigated further by studying the LM status of the Medical Team during a visit to western Samoa, and by performing a microbiological survey of water quality. It was found that half of the Medical Team 3/6, became malabsorbers during the week spent in Western Samoa. On returning to New Zealand it was shown that lactase levels took 3 months to normalise. The water supply in Western Samoa was shown to contain very high levels of coliform bacteria. The currently held hypothesis that genetic factors are solely involved in the onset of LM, was not supported. The evidence from the survey supported environmental factors are also involved in adult onset LM. The hypothesis suggesting that dietary lactose was a requirement for retaining elevated lactase levels, was tested using Galactosemic and Phenyl Ketonuria patients. None of the patients had developed LM although they had been on a low lactose diet for years, hence the theory was not supported. The BH method proved highly successful in diagnosing LM with many of the children actually enjoying it.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the GH/IGF axis in the infant rat brain following hypoxic ischemic injury</field><field name="creator">Scheepens, Arjan</field><field name="description">Brain injuries, be they hypoxic, ischemic, traumatic or neurodegenerative result in permanent neurological deficit and presently there are few or no therapeutic interventions available. Recent research into how and why brain cells die after an insult has elucidated that a significant number of cells die in an apoptotic manner. Following a transient brain injury cells continue to die for upto 5 days after the insult thereby giving a window of opportunity for treatment. In response to injury, the brain produces a range of neurotrophic hormones including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), which are thought to act as endogenous neuroprotective agents. This response occurs earlier and to a greater extent in the young. Studies have shown that the exogenous administration of these neurotrophic hormones after brain injury can prevent some cell death, likely through an inhibition of apoptosis. In these studies a well characterised model of HI brain injury in the juvenile rat was used to investigate the response of the IGF-I and growth hormone (GH) axes to brain injury. The action and transport of IGF-I is partly regulated by six binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) for which the response of IGFBP 1-5 to neural injury has been shown. The starting point therefore is a description of the response of IGFBP-6 to HI brain injury. Although the GH receptor is widely expressed in the brain on both neurones and glia, no reports have definitively shown the existence of its ligand, GH within the brain. Here I show that the GH receptor is differentially regulated after neural injury and that its immunolocalisation suggests an importation mechanisms for peripheral GH into the injured CNS, via the choroid plexus. Furthermore I show that a GH-like substance is strongly upregulated after injury, specifically associated with stressed and dying neurones and glia. Subsequently, I show that intracerebral infusions of rat GH into the injured rat brain conveys significant protection exclusively to GH receptor bearing neurones. In summary, these data show a GH-like substance may be acting as a new neurotrophic factor which is upregulated after brain injury and may act as an endogenous neuroprotective agent.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypoxic-ischemic injury in the developing brain: pathogenesis and neuroprotection</field><field name="creator">Sizonenko, St&#233;phane Vladimir</field><field name="description">In newborn infants, birth asphyxia represents the predominant cause of brain injury. These infants will later exhibit neurodevelopmental disabilities or a more major cerebral palsy. Prevention of adverse outcomes requires an understanding of the way in which these deficits develop. Endogenous protective mechanisms arising from the insult have opened new insights in neuroprotective strategies. Neurotrophic factors such as IGF-1 and its N-terminal tripeptide GPE have been shown to confer some neuroprotection after HI injury in the adult rodent. In the P21 rat brain after moderate HI injury, exogenous intracerebral and intraperitoneal injections of GPE (30&#956;g and 300&#956;g respectively) were neuroprotective in the hippocampus and lateral cortex possibly through binding to glia as detected by autoradiography of 3H-GPE. In the preterm infant the mechanisms of white matter injury remain to be clearly elucidated. To mimic the pattern of diffuse cerebral injury of the very preterm infant, a transient moderate focal HI injury has been applied on the immature P3 rat. This new model showed a significant reduction in the lateral cortical volume with reduction and alteration of the myelination pattern in the cortical white matter (WM) at P21. These cortical alterations result from neuro-axonal damage 24h after the insult as shown with Fluoro-Jade B staining and &#946;-APP accumulation. In addition activated astrocytes from 24h after HI up to P21 were present. This model should enable us to elucidate some of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in diffuse WM injury. Brain damage in the developing brain has two components: 1) the pattern and mechanisms of injury are correlated with the stage of development at the time of injury; 2) it will influence subsequent brain development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurochemical and functional characterization of the ischaemic/reperfused retina</field><field name="creator">Sun, Daniel</field><field name="description">Ischaemic cell death has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, including glaucomatous neuropathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and a range of vascular diseases. The cascade of events leading to cell death involves both cellular metabolic changes and a functional component. However, it is yet unknown how long these changes persist, whether all cell classes are affected, and the characteristics of recovery. Moreover, there have been few studies correlating the neurochemical changes with the ensuing functional changes. The aim of this thesis was to track the metabolic and functional recovery of the ischaemic rat retina, given the premise that: (1) amino acid neurochemistry reflects metabolic integrity and cellular identity, and; (2) the permeation of a cation channel probe called agmatine reflects channel functionality. Quantitative pattern recognition analysis of overlapping amino acid and agmatine expression profiles were used to provide a statistically robust classification of cells according to metabolic and functional characteristics. This classification was spatially complete and with single cell resolution. Finally, the electroretinogram was used to also assess retinal function and corroborate the observed neurochemical changes. These measures were taken at intervals for up to two weeks of reperfusion. The results show that by 48 hours of reperfusion, amino acid metabolism had returned to near normal levels, although cell classes were missing, and there was persistant cation channel gating anomalies. Immunocytochemical labeling identified a preferential loss of cone bipolar cells, with all remaining rod bipolar cells showing increased cation channel gating. The electroretinogram and agmatine experiments showed that this dysfunction is likely due to abnormal glutamate release from pre-synaptic photoreceptors, detected by changes in post-synaptic agmatine permeation, and not due to the presence of anomalous metabotropic glutamate receptors. Cholinergic amacrine cells demonstrated persistant neurochemical labeling, but did not show cationic flux following stimulation by glutamate agonists. In conclusion, the retina shows remarkable recovery in the amino acid metabolism, although functional changes persist. Finally, structural integrity or immunocytochemical labeling does not necessarily imply that cells maintain functional receptors, or that neurotransmitter release is normal secondary to disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321016 Opthalmology and vision science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purification, biochemical and somatogenic characterisation of ovine placental lactogen</field><field name="creator">Singh, Kuljeet</field><field name="description">Ovine placental lactogen (oPL) is secreted by the placenta into both the fetal and maternal compartments. Its biological function(s) during pregnancy and the mechanisms involved are still unclear. A purification procedure was developed for oPL from sheep placental cotyledons of late gestation. Four procedures were attempted to obtain homogeneous oPL. Recoveries of oPL and total protein were measured throughout the several procedures using a specific oPL RIA and the Bradford protein estimation respectively. The third and fourth procedures resulted in homogeneous oPL and a partial amino acid sequence was obtained from the fourth procedure. In the successful procedures, the placental tissue was extracted with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5. A pH precipitation of the soluble fraction was performed, followed by 60% saturation with ammonium sulphate. Further separation steps involved chromatogaphic procedures. Carboxymethylcellulose (CM32) cation exchange was performed batchwise at pH 5.6. Subsequently chromatofocusing was performed to elute proteins in order of their isoelectric points. This was carried out using a pH gadient of 0.9 to 6.0. The final chromatographic step was reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a C4 column. To obtain homogeneous oPL in the third procedure, the partially purified oPL was subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The homogeneous oPL was eluted from the membrane, however, sequencing was unsuccessful. It was assumed that the N terminal of oPL was blocked. Homogeneous oPL was obtained in the fourth procedure by electrophoretic elution from the Hunkapiller gel system performed at 4&#176;C. The oPL was digested with trypsin, the fragments were separated by RP-HPLC chromatography and two peptides were sequenced. Peptide 1: F D E Q Y G Q G I Peptide 2: Y I N C H T Several strategies were attempted to provide more homogeneous oPL to enable more sequencing. The partially purified oPL fractions from each of these attempts were pooled and electrophoresed on an SDS polyacrylamide gel. The section of acrylamide containing the oPL band was homogenised and a trypsin digest was performed. The digested oPL was separated from the gel pieces, filtered through a Sep-Pak filter and the fragments were separated by RP-HPLC. The yield of oPL was low, but sufficient homogeneous oPL was obtained to provide a partial amino acid sequence from tryptic peptides. A further two peptides provided sequences. Peptide 3: (L) A G E M V N R F D E Q Y G Q G I Peptide 4: (L) Q P G K C Q I P L Q S L F Collaborators from Genentech Inc (San Francisco USA) used partially purified oPL produced from the present study and also obtained homogeneous oPL (Colosi et al., 1989). Complementary DNA clones of oPL were isolated and expressed in mammalian cells by recombinant DNA techniques (Colosi et al., 1989). These clones were sequenced, demonstrating that the full sequence of oPL consists of 198 amino acids preceded by a 38 amino acid sequence signal. Recombinant oPL was generated by Colosi et al. (1989) which provided sufficient material to perform physiological studies in vivo. The somatogenic effects of recombinant oPL were investigated in the growth hormone (GH) deficient dwarf rat and compared to identical doses of recombinant bovine GH (bGH) in 3 independent studies. Both oPL and bGH treatments resulted in an increase (p&lt;0.05) in body weight gain compared to that in saline treated controls, with oPL treatment being more potent than bGH (p&lt;0.05). In promoting linear growth, oPL was more potent (p&lt;0.05) than bGH in some instances. Nitrogen content of dry carcass matter was increased with oPL treatment compared to saline (p&lt;0.05), with a nonsignificant increase in bGH treated animals. Carcass fat was similarly reduced by both oPL and bGH treatment (p&lt;0.05) compared to saline. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations were increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) by both oPL and bGH treatments, with a significantly greater effect of oPL suggested in one study. No increase in hepatic IGF-I mRNA was evident with either treatment, suggesting that the increase in serum IGF-I is due to posttranscriptional mechanisms. The expression of IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) hepatic mRNA was increased (p&lt;0.05) with bGH treatment compared to that after saline treatment, but was unaffected by opL treatment, indicating regulation by GH at the transcriptional level. The binding of [125I]bGH to hepatic membrane preparations demonstrated no difference in specific binding compared to that in saline controls. However, [125I]oPL specific binding was greater in oPL treated animals (p&lt;0.05). Animals treated with bGH had reduced (p&lt;0.05) hepatic GH receptor mRNA compared to saline controls, but oPL treatment had no effect. Thus, oPL is a potent anabolic and lipolytic agent in the dwarf rat, exerting greater somatogenic effects on some parameters than bGH. The studies in this thesis have described biochemical and biological characterisitics of oPL. The amino acid sequence of oPL is more closely related to prolactin (PRL) than to GH (Colosi et al., 1989). However, oPL has potent somatogenic activities in the GH deficient dwarf rat. Our data suggest differences in receptor binding and effects on GH receptor and IGFBP-3 expression with these two treatments, raising the possibility of actions through different pathways or differential effects at the GH receptor level. These results do not fully resolve whether GH and PRL exert all effects through a single receptor or whether there is a separate PL receptor.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The order of premodifiers in English nominal phrases</field><field name="creator">Feist, James Murray</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis sought an explanation for the order of premodifiers in English nominal phrases. It aimed to establish what validity there is in the quite divergent earlier explanations, to find any other valid forms of explanation that might exist, and to integrate them all. The method was to make a wide survey of as many varieties of current English as possible, by observation; to then analyse the order at all levels (semantics, syntax, and so on); and to check the accuracy of the results against the 100-million-word British National Corpus. From that research, the thesis asserts that parts of most past approaches can be integrated into a comprehensive explanation; and that there is a new and important element of the full explanation, namely that of words' semantic structure, which is the combination of types and dimensions of meaning that make up the sense of each premodifier. Other new elements in this treatment of the subject are analysis of long groups of premodifiers (up to 10 words), consideration of why premodifiers regularly occur in different positions in the order, and explanation from the historical development of premodifier order. After an introductory chapter and a survey of the relevant literature, the thesis argues that the explanation of premodifier order in English nominal phrases is as follows. There are four positions for premodifiers, as in "your (1) actual (2) tinny (3) round (4) percussion instrument" [i.e. a tambourine] (chapter 3). The regular, unmarked order (illustrated in the phrase just quoted) has several elements of explanation: primarily, the semantic structure (chapter 4); secondarily, the syntactic structure (chapter 5). In a second type of order (when two or more words occur in one position), stylistic considerations control the order, not grammatical ones (chapter 7). In a third type of order, a marked one, a premodifier may be put in a position different from the position that the word's usual semantic structure would require, changing its meaning and stylistic effect (chapter 8). Some features of all three types of order are to be explained partly by their historical development - for example, the existence of borderline uses (chapter 9). There are some supporting explanations, from discourse structure and psycholinguistics, for example (chapter 10). The relevance of the previous chapters to wider issues, such as grammaticalisation, is discussed (chapter 11); and conclusions are drawn (chapter 12).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of interleukin 2 and interleukin 3 in haemopoiesis</field><field name="creator">Le Gros, Graham Stephen</field><field name="description">The hormones interleukin 2 (ILZ) and interleukin 3 (IL3 can stimulate the growth of immature haemopoietic cells. These hormones are synthesised by mature thymus-derived (T) Iymphocytes. The observation that the haemopoietic tissue of the bone marrow contain few T lymphocytes leads to the question of what role IL2 and IL3 have in haemopoiesis. An original finding described in this thesis was that IL3 induced a population of haemopoietic cells to synthesise IL2, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF when stimulated with complexes of antigen and antibody. This demonstrated that there were cells in the bone marrow which synthesised hormones normally considered T lymphocyte-derived. It was possible to correlate the production of IL2, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF by IL3-dependent cells with Ag.Ab complex- and mast cell-associated inflammatory processes. A second finding described in this thesis was that haemopoietic cell lines dependent on IL3 for growth could be stimulated to grow by IL2. A unique feature of these IL3-dependent cell lines was that they could be adapted to an IL2-dependent growth state without further differentiation occurring. Such cells provide a tool for dissecting the intracellular growth regulating pathways which are controlled by IL2 and IL3. The influence of IL2 on the development of T lymphocytes in the microenvironment of the thymus was examined. It was found that the normal programme of T lymphocyte differentiation was altered by IL2. IL2 was found to stimulate the growth of an immature class of thymocytes which expressed cytotoxic activity. These cells had the potential to participate in host immune and inflammatory responses. The haemopoietic cell responses induced by IL2 and IL3 appear to reflect the differentiation of immature cells for roles in immune responses. This indicates that IL2 and IL3 may not have a role in normal haemopoietic cell development. The hormones which normally regulate the output of cells from the thymus and bone marrow may not yet be fully defined.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320200 Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between neurotoxicity, accumulation, and physiochemical properties of a series of platinum drugs</field><field name="creator">Screnci, Daniela</field><field name="description">Peripheral neurotoxicity induced by some platinum chemotherapy agents is the dose limiting factor, seriously affecting the quality of life of chemotherapy patients who receive this treatment. The cause of the peripheral neurotoxicity remains unknown. Using an animal model, the neurotoxic profiles of a series of platinum compounds and their related stereoisomers were determined. The series consisted of cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, S,S-oxaliplatin, ormaplatin, R,R- and S,S- ormaplatin and JM216. The neurotoxicity of these compounds in the animal model was correlated with their hydrophobicity, accumulation and reactivity. Also, using peripheral nerve tissues dissected at the end of treatment (or at specific timepoints) from the animals, morphological changes induced by the platinum compounds were also measured. Animals were administered the platinum compounds at the maximally tolerated dose, for a period of eight weeks, to determine the onset of neurotoxicity as indicated by changes in the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV). The cumulative doses at which the platinum compounds in the series induced neurotoxicity (neurotoxic dose potency) in the animal model varied. Oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity at the smallest dose and therefore at the earliest timepoint (l5&#181;mo1/kg, 3 weeks of treatment) and carboplatin induced neurotoxicity at the highest dose and the latest timepoint (322 &#181;mo1/kg, 8 weeks of treatment). The neurotoxic dose potency was compared to data obtained from the literature of incidence of neurotoxicity in patients. There was a strong correlation (r2 = 0.9871). It has previously been hypothesised (Gregg. et al. 1992) that platinum accumulation in peripheral nervous tissues plays a role in platinum induced neurotoxicity. Using tissues obtained from animal studies, the platinum concentration in peripheral nerve tissues was determined via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. There was no correlation between the amount of platinum accumulated in these tissues (dorsal root ganglia, sural nerve and sciatic nerve) and neurotoxicity. Furthermore it was expected that the accumulation of these compounds in the peripheral nervous system would be related to the hydrophobicity of the compound. The inverse was found to be true. The more hydrophilic the platinum compound, the greater the accumulation in the peripheral nerve tissues, and the more hydrophobic the platinum compound the lesser the accumulation in the peripheral nerve tissue (eg. drg r2 = 0.99, P=0.004). Using in vitro protein binding half life, the reactivity of compounds in the platinum series was assessed. It was determined that the neurotoxic compounds had a shorter half life and were more reactive than the non neurotoxic compounds. A positive correlation was also observed between reactivity and the incidence of neurotoxicity in patients (r2 = 0.89, P=0.0005). Tissues obtained from the animals were used to measure changes in dorsal root ganglia nucleolar diameter, and comparison made between the nucleolar diameter of each of the treatment groups, and their changes in SNCV. Strong correlations were observed between nucleolar diameter changes and altered SNCV in animals (r2=0.9971). From the above-mentioned studies, insight was gained into the physical parameters of the platinum compounds in the series that were associated with different neurotoxicity profiles. As yet a definite mechanism has not clearly defined but it is hypothesised to involve molecular nucleolar changes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of human placental enzymology</field><field name="creator">Small, C.W.</field><field name="description">A.

Insulin bound specifically to both normal and transformed cells with similar dependence on temperature, time, and pH. There were fewer high affinity and more low .affinity receptors on tumour cells compared with normal adult fibroblasts. The affinity of insulin receptors in normal foetal fibroblasts was less than in normal adult fibroblasts while transformed foetal fibroblasts had receptors of even lower affinity. The sensitivity of insulin receptors to down regulation by insulin was measured in the human breast tumour cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D and the human colon tumour cell line HCT-8 and was compared with measurements in normal human adult fibroblasts. Adult fibroblasts were sensitive to down regulation (40% loss of binding after 2h exposure to 17nM insulin) whereas breast tumour cells were resistant to down regulation (15-17% loss of binding after 4h exposure to 170nM insulin). HCT-8 cells were sensitive to down regulation after 4h exposure to 3.8nM insulin but the extent of down regulation lessened at higher concentrations of insulin. This paradoxical result appeared due to an increase in the affinity of receptors on HCT-8 cells for insulin following exposure to hormone; by comparison, the affinity of receptors on fibroblasts significantly decreased during down regulation. Insulin-induced down regulation of receptors was also compared between normal and transformed foetal fibroblasts. Normal foetal fibroblasts were less sensitive to insulin-induced receptor down regulation than were adult fibroblasts. Transformed foetal fibroblasts had lost all high affinity receptors so that receptor down regulation was too low to measure. Biological responses to insulin (insulin-stimulated [3H]leucine incorporation into protein and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA) were measured in parallel with studies of receptor regulation in order to assess the effect of down regulation on cell metabolism. Fibroblasts were more responsive to insulin-stimulated leucine and thymidine incorporation than were tumour cells. Down regulation of insulin receptors decreased the responsiveness of fibroblasts but not tumour cells to insulin-stimulated leucine incorporation. Responsiveness of tumour cells to insulin-stimulated leucine incorporation paradoxically increased with lengthy exposure to insulin. The responsiveness of fibroblasts to insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation was unchanged following receptor down regulation and insulin did not induce a change in cell number. Insulin had variable effects on thymidine incorporation in tumour cells and in most instances induced parallel changes in cell growth. Tumour cells thus differ from normal cells in their expression and regulation of insulin receptors and their responsiveness to insulin. These differences may well contribute to the metabolic and growth advantage that tumour cells have over normal tissue.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Systems approach to a comprehensive community project: a study in community psychology</field><field name="creator">Seymour, Frederick William</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the concepts and methods of community psychology, and. applies them to what is called here a &#8220;comprehensive community project&#8221;. This is a project that undertakes to meet the needs of a community by fostering and strengthening the community&#8217;s own resources. The objectives of the research were : (1) to establish a comprehensive community project in the Auckland. suburbs of Birkdale and Beachhaven, and (2) to propose and. test a model for project organization and evaluation. The model was derived. from the systems approach to programme evaluation which provides a reasoned and. logical approach to all aspects of programme management. The model proposed involved systematic steps from initial programme planning to outcome measurement. The steps are, specifying the "system&#8221; or particular project, forming the values from which interventions would be derived, assessing needs and. resources, setting annual goals for activities from the foregoing steps, allocating available resources to activities, implementing and. reviewing activities, measuring outcome after one year, and feedback of this information for project improvement. Application of the model to the &#8220;Birkdale Project&#8221; showed that the model was relevant to management needs, and. Information yielded by application of the model was used. in day-to-day decision making. Thus the model was instrumental in establishing the Birkdale Project, and. in producing the vigorous project that resulted. in the first year a wide range of activities involving a significant portion of the population were provided. to meet community needs, and almost all the Project&#8217;s annual goals were attained. Although the project was established largely by paid professionally trained people, at the end. of the research period. the project was managed and run by non-professional residents. It was concluded. that the systems approach is highly appropriate to the development of comprehensive community projects, and has general advantages to the wider field of community psychology as a method for practice and research.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the pathogenesis and immunobiology of pyelonephritis</field><field name="creator">Miller, Thomas</field><field name="description">The experiments carried out during this investigation have studied the pathogenesis and immunobiology of pyelonephritis. Two experimental models of the disease were developed in laboratory animals and several new analytical procedures for studying biological changes during the course of the disease were established. In particular, methods for the determination of glomerular filtration rates in small animals, the automated analysis of antibacterial antibody and the in-vitro determination of the response of rat lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were established. The effect of chronic active pyelonephritis on renal function was studied and the effect of antibiotic treatment and elimination of infection on the pathological changes in pyelonephritis was determined. Eradication of infection did not affect the gross pathology and histopathological changes found at autopsy. These experiments have also investigated the role of bacterial interference as a determinant in the epidemiology of renal infection. It was shown that mixed renal infections with E.coli were uncommon and that the pattern of infection was determined by the resident pathogen. The relationship between bacterial infection or the renal parenchyma with E.coli and the establishment of pathological lesions was investigated and the conclusion reached that infection of the kidney is not always associated with pathological changes. The term "acquiescent infection" was then used to describe the host parasite relationship in which active persistent bacterial infection is not associated with pathological lesions. Antigen presentation as a factor in the protective immune response to renal infection was also studied and experiments carried out which demonstrated that immunological memory to the Somatic antigen of E.coli persisted for at least Six months after primary immunization and appeared to be carried by the B lymphocytes. The distribution of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid sites and the functional capacity of T cells during the course of pyelonephritis were also investigated. Lymphocytes forming the lymphocytic infiltrate in the kidney were identified an thymus derived lymphocytes by their surface labelling characteristics but further experiments showed that T lymphocytes in the kidney, which would normally respond to stimulation with PHA in-vitro, were non-responsive and presumably non-functional. A unique factor associated with renal cells was found to be capable of blocking the PHA response of T lymphocytes, suggesting that ablation of cell-mediated immune mechanisms in the kidney may contribute to the persistence of infection in pyelonephritis. This concept was investigated by studying the effect of a selective deficiency of thymus derived lymphocytes on the course of pyelonephritis. The experiments showed, however, that ablation of T lymphocytes did not appreciably alter the course of the disease. Further experiments were then carried out investigating the role of B lymphocytes in the immune response by manipulation of the hosts immune capacity using immunosuppressive drugs. Animals with pyelonephritis did not produce antibacterial antibody but were able to eliminate organisms more readily from the infected kidney than untreated animals with a normal immune response. This suggests that blocking of the phenomenon of immunologic enhancement may explain these unexpected results and that the immune response to renal infection could have an enhancing role, protecting the bacterial cell from otherwise effective host defense mechanisms. Clinical aspects of antimicrobial resistance in pyelonephritis were also investigated in a study of urinary tract pathogens from 120 patients. The results showed that standard methods for testing antibiotic sensitivity may reject potentially useful antibiotics and that up to 75% of microorganisms considered resistant to individual antibiotics may in fact be sensitive to concentrations of antibiotic attainable in the tubular lumen. In certain circumstances the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of selected antibiotics may be of considerable value in patient management.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scanning electron microscopic and electrophysiological investigation of experimental acoustic trauma</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Peter Rowland, 1954-</field><field name="description">Investigations were undertaken to describe and quantitate the topographical abnormalities which develop in the organ of Corti as a result of acoustic trauma, and to determine their relationship to the associated losses of cochlear function assessed by the compound action Potential (N1) and cochlear microphonics (CM). Thirty guinea pigs were exposed, while anaesthetised, to a tone of 3 KHz at 125 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Both organs of Corti were examined by scanning electron microscopy either immediately or 1,3,7 or 14 days after exposure. In the second study 26 anaesthetised guinea pigs were exposed to 5 KHz at 125 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Cochlear potentials were recorded from the round window of the right cochlea and N1 audiograms (sound Pressure level required to elicit N1 Plotted against frequency) and 10 &#956;v isopotential curves (sound pressure level required to produce 10 &#956;v CM plotted against frequency) were produced for each animal either within one hour or 1,7,14 or 28 days later. The same organ of Corti was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Cochlear potentials were compared to mean values from 16 normal guinea pigs. Most animals developed topographical changes in one or both organs of Corti after exposure to 3 KHz (90%) and in the right organ of Corti after 5 KHz (92%). There was a wide variation in both the length (3 KHz: 0.1-4.15 mm; 5 KHz: 0.5-16.0 mm) of lesions and the number of hair cells affected. Both these indices of damage increased significantly (p &lt;0.01) in the 24 hours following exposure to 5 KHz. Early damage to hair cells included either collapse, fusion or loss of stereocilia and there was an increase in the proportion of affected cells towards the centre of the lesions where supporting cells were damaged also. Subsequent to exposure, collapsed stereocilia appeared to become fused and some hair cells, particularly OHC, with stereocilia abnormalities were lost. However, others, particularly IHC, remained for up to 28 days despite abnormal stereocilia. Early changes occurred around the position of maximum displacement of the basilar membrane and subsequent extension of the lesions occurred equally in both apical and basal directions. Fusion was the only stereocilia change to develop after exposure. Regions of the organ of Corti showing supporting cell damage were replaced within 3-7 days by the proliferation of inner sulcus and Claudius&#8217; cells. The substantial initial loss of both N1 thresholds and CM sensitivity partially recovered during the first 24 hours after exposure, but paradoxically, this was associated with the significant increase in the topographical changes in the organ of Corti. N1 threshold loss occurred over all frequencies and was maximum 1/2 &#8211; 1 octave higher than the exposure frequency (5 KHz). All lesions occurred within regions corresponding to changes in N1 thresholds. In the first 24 hours topographical changes occurred over a much smaller area of the organ of Corti than indicated by changes in N1 thresholds. Seven or more days later the longer lesions (30%) reflected the extent of changes in N1 but the remainder were smaller than indicated by this functional loss. This suggests that functionally important damage to the cochlea is more extensive than indicated by hair cell loss, stereocilia abnormality or supporting cell changes in the organ of Corti. Therefore, investigations of the effects of noise should not be based simply on topographical changes in the organ of Corti as these often underestimate the extent of injury to the cochlea.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology of birthweight and placental weight in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thompson, John Michael David</field><field name="description">The introduction to this thesis is a literature review. Kramer, in a study commissioned by WHO, reviewed the literature prior to 1985 on low birthweight. This is extended, mainly in respect to infants who are small for gestational age with emphasis on important findings in relation to birthweight since that time. Work in New Zealand on birthweight is also summarised. The literature is also reviewed in respect to the mechanisms in the pathway between the placenta and the fetus, and in respect to recent work suggesting a link between birthweight and disease in adult life. This thesis examines factors that influence birthweight and placental weight. Birthweight for gestational age percentile curves for the New Zealand population were firstly defined. small for gestational age (SGA) infants could then be categorised. The thesis considers two sources of data, the first a cross-sectional sample of the New Zealand population from 1987 to 1990 (the control subjects of the New Zealand cot Death study, a national case-control study on sudden infant death syndrome), and the second a hospital population in Auckland (National Womens Hospital (l992)). These two datasets are investigated to determine factors that influence birthweight in a univariate situation and then in the multivariate situation. Independent variables are considered using a priori categorisations and where appropriate Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) derived categorisations determined by producing plots of the quantiles of cases versus controls. A number of variables under the headings of socio-demographic, lifestyle, genetic, obstetric and nutrition are examined and found to be associated with the outcomes of interest at the univariate level. After controlling in multivariate analyses a number of variables are found to be no longer significant, however some show strong relationships. The variable relating to smoking in both datasets shows the greatest detrimental effect on the outcomes considered in respect to birthweight. This confirms that in New Zealand, as in other places in the world, smoking has significant consequences on birthweight. The data is also investigated for the timing of insult to the fetus from smoking, and is found to be most important during pregnancy. comparison of the results comparing those obtained using a binary outcome for SGA, and those obtained using birthweight continuously, show relatively consistent results. The odds ratios and the decreases in birthweight obtained from both datasets show a relatively linear relationship between the two. An examination into whether a distinct group of individuals exists in respect to having large placentae for birthweight, indentified an artefact in the dataset relating to recording of placental weight for twins. After removal of twins from the dataset, examination of factors that influence placental weight showed that the factors that influence placental weight are not the same as those that influence birthweight. In particular smoking is found not to influence placental weight, and haemoglobin, which has no influence on birthweight, is found to be inversely associated with placental weight. other factors such as parity are found to influence placental weight in the same proportion in which birthweight is affected. In conclusion this thesis shows that factors investigated in New Zealand are consistent with findings in the international literature in relation to birthweight. The results on factors that influence placental weight add to the international literature on a topic on which little work has been carried out. The results of this thesis point to areas where future research needs to be carried out, in particular in relation to maternal nutrition during pregnancy and maternal energy expenditure during pregnancy. There is also a need for further research into the relationships of factors on placental weight and the ratio of birthweight to placental weight, and how these relationships affect health outcomes in childhood and adult life.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the foetal adrenal glands in the mechanism of initiation of parturition in the ewe</field><field name="creator">Liggins, Graham Collingwood</field><field name="description">Pregnancy in the sheep, as in other mammals, has a genetically-determined species-specific duration.

The work of this thesis is an attempt to elucidate some of the factors responsible for ensuring that at the appropriate time the uterus of the pregnant sheep expels its contents. From a review of existing publications it is obvious that the factors influencing gestation length in sheep are poorly understood and that the mechanism of initiation of parturition is unknown. It is fruitless to try to apply knowledge gained in other species to the solution of the problem; among the multitude of hypotheses, none has proved acceptable as a complete description of the events which culminate in parturition in a particular species let alone as a basis secure enough to permit extrapolation to sheep.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's London: The metropolis and New Zealand's culture, 1890-1940</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Felicity</field><field name="description">The role of London in forming New Zealand&#8217;s culture and identity is a significant feature of New Zealand&#8217;s cultural history that has, until now, been overlooked.  Ties with London and with &#8216;Home&#8217; generally, have received little study, and &#8216;Britishness&#8217; in New Zealand is largely considered a legacy of demography to be eventually outgrown.  This thesis suggests something different.  During the period 1890-1940, technology changed cultural perceptions of time and space, and it changed the relationship between metropole and former colony too.  These technologies drew New Zealand and London closer together.  London was constructed as an active part of the New Zealand cultural landscape, rather than as a nostalgic remnant of a predominantly British-born settler population.  London was New Zealand&#8217;s metropolis too, with consequences for the way New Zealand culture was shaped.  This thesis considers the cultural impact of London using four tropes linked to those changing perceptions of time and space.  &#8216;Greater New Zealand&#8217; is concerned with space, whilst &#8216;&#8220;New&#8221; New Zealand&#8217; is concerned with time.  &#8216;London&#8217;s Farm&#8217; and the &#8216;Imaginative Hinterland&#8217; consider propinquity and simultaneity respectively.  Each theme draws from different bases of evidence in order to suggest London&#8217;s broad impact.  Collectively, they argue for a shift away from a core and periphery relationship, towards one better described as a city and hinterland relationship.  This approach draws upon existing national, imperial, and cultural historiography, whilst at the same time questioning some of their conventions and conceptions.  New Zealand as hinterland challenges the conceptual borders of &#8216;national history&#8217;, exploring the transnational nature of cultural formations that otherwise have been considered as autochthonous New Zealand (or for that matter, British) developments.  At the same time, whilst hinterlands may exist as part of empire, they are not necessarily products of it.  Nor are they necessarily formed in opposition to the metropole, even though alterity is often used to explain colonial relationships.  &#8216;New Zealand&#8217;s London&#8217; is, instead a reciprocal creation.  Its shared cultural landscape is specific, but at the same time, it offers an alternative means for understanding other white settler colonies.  Like New Zealand, their cultural histories may be more complex cultural constructions than national or imperial stories allow.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">empire</field><field name="subject">London</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Substrate Parameters on the Morphology of Thermally Sprayed PEEK Splats</field><field name="creator">Withy, Benjamin Paul</field><field name="description">Thermal spray is a well established technology that is commonly used in the aerospace and automotive industries.  This thesis reports on the effect that substrate surface chemistry, morphology and temperature has on the morphology of PEEK single splats on aluminium substrates.  PEEK single splats were deposited by HVAF and plasma spraying on aluminium substrates with 6 different pretreatments.  Substrates were either sprayed at room temperature, or 323&#176;C, and a subset of substrates was held at incremental temperatures up to 363&#176;C.  HVAF deposited splats on room temperature substrates showed sensitivity to surface chemistry, with increased circularity and area associated with low levels of hydroxide and chemisorbed water on the aluminium surface.  Substrates held at 323&#176;C were more sensitive to substrate morphology, where rough surfaces resulted in decreased circularity and area apparently independent of surface chemistry.  Substrate temperature trials revealed a significant step in the results, equating to greater circularity, and lower splat area, perimeter and Feret diameter.  This step occurred between 123&#176;C and 163&#176;C, the two points bracketing the glass transition temperature of PEEK (143&#176;C).  This result  was due to the relaxation of splats deposited on surfaces above 143&#176;C, whilst splats on cooler substrates quench through the glass transition and do not relax.  PEEK splats deposited by plasma spray on room temperature and 323&#176;C substrates showed sensitivity to the amount of hydroxide and chemisorbed water present on the aluminium substrates, with low levels resulting in more circular and larger area splats.  Plasma splats did not show the same temperature effects as HVAF splats, thought to be due to the more molten state of plasma splats upon impact compared to the HVAF splats.  The primary conclusions reached were that plasma sprayed polymers were sensitive to surface chemistry, and that as such the surface chemistry of a substrate should be considered when forming plasma spray polymer coatings.  It was also concluded that the kinetic energy of particles in HVAF thermal spray contributed significantly to the thermal energy of a particle on impact, allowing for improved splat properties without overheating the particles in flight.  Finally it was concluded that substrate temperature is far more important for HVAF thermal spray of polymers than plasma spray of polymers, but that it improves splat properties for both techniques.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermal Spray</field><field name="subject">Surface Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of ductile endurance of earthquake resisting steel members</field><field name="creator">Hyland, Clark</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a structural and materials engineering explanation for many of the running fractures that occurred in steel structures during the destructive Kobe and Northridge earthquakes in the mid 1990s.

The study commenced following the 2000 World Earthquake Conference in Auckland.  The conference brought together the findings of the huge research effort, in America, Japan, Europe and New Zealand, that followed the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes.  The running fractures that had occurred in steel structures represented an unpredicted failure mode that structural engineers have not known how to predict or suppress through the engineering design process.  A clear fundamental understanding of the causes and how to prevent the fractures did not arise from the conference. In fact apparently conflicting results were reported.  Full scale cyclic tests in New Zealand on structural assemblies had not resulted in running fractures, whereas tests in American and Japan had.  Structural engineers designing earthquake resistant structures rely on constructional steel to be materially homogeneous and nominally tri-linear in behaviour.  Steel is expected to behave elastically under regular in-service loading, have a reliable and flat yield stress-strain characteristic, and under overload then develop predictable levels of strain-hardening in conjunction with significant plastic elongation up to its ultimate tensile strength.  Steel is expected to eventually fracture after further plastic elongation and necking.  Ductile design strategies and methods utilise the plastic elongation characteristics of steel to protect structures in earthquake.  Plastic deformation is considered to beneficially dissipate energy generated in the structure by a severe earthquake and also dampen the structure&#8217;s response.  The occurrence of running fracture without significant cyclic plastic deformation and before section necking in steelwork, therefore undermines the basis of the ductile seismic design approach. The initial part of the thesis is devoted to bringing together the fundamental aspects of materials engineering related to fracture of constructional steel.  This is intended to provide a bridge of knowledge for structural engineering practitioners and researchers not fully conversant with materials engineering aspects of fracture.  Fracture behaviour in steel is a broad and complex topic that developed rapidly in the twentieth century driven by the demands of technological growth.  The unexpected fracture of welded liberty ships at sea in World War 2; the need for reliable long term containment for the nuclear reactors in the 1950s and 1960s; and prevention of fatigue failures in aircraft frames since the 1950s all drove engineering research into steel fracture behaviour.  There are many subtle variations in definitions in the published literature on fracture that can be confusing.  Therefore an attempt has been made to clarify terminology.  The term brittle fracture in particular is only used in this thesis as applying to running fracture when the general or far field tensile stresses are below the yield stress of the steel.  The term pre-necking or running fracture is preferred to describe the condition more broadly which may occur prior to and also after general yielding, but before section necking.  Running fracture is a manifestation of pre-necking fracture in which insufficient plastic flow is available in the assembly to absorb the energy released upon fracture. The experimental studies investigated the behaviour of constructional steel commonly used in New Zealand, at various levels of plastic strain.  This started with Charpy V-Notch (CVN) testing which revealed that a significant transition temperature shift and curve shape change occurs with increasing plastic strain and the associated strain-hardening.   This showed that the ability of steel to avoid pre-necking or running fracture reduces as the level of plastic strain-hardening increases. Temperature controlled Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) testing was then undertaken. The setting of testing temperatures for the CTOD tests were guided by review of the CVN test results, using published CVN to fracture toughness correlation methods.  However running cleavage fractures developed in the CTOD specimens at higher than predicted temperatures of 10 oC and 20 oC.  These are typical service temperatures for structures in New Zealand and so are very likely to occur at the time of an earthquake. The implication from this is that there are levels of strain-hardening and conditions of material notching constraint that can lead to pre-necking and running fracture in New Zealand fabricated steel structures, under severe earthquake loading. Care was taken in the CTOD testing to monitor and maximise the capture of data electronically using a specially developed Direct Current Potential Drop method.  This allowed the test results to be analysed and considered in varying ways, leading to a consistent assessment of the CTOD, crack growth, and the specific work of fracture in each test piece.  While CTOD test results have sometimes been published by structural and welding engineering researchers in the wake of Kobe and Northridge, the results were typically of little use for this study as the CTOD initiation point was generally not identified effectively.  The effect of remote plastic flow in the specimens was also not adequately accounted for.  The CTOD test results were often simply used to help correlate other factors observed by the researchers.  Side-grooving of specimens was not reported as having been used in any of the published results reviewed.  When conducting CTOD test with highly ductile constructional steels it is very difficult to get useful CTOD results if the specimens are not side-grooved, as significant necking and tunnelling will otherwise occur and limit the usefulness of the results. Work by Knott and also by McRobie and Smith was seminal in terms of identifying some critical aspects of plane strain development in CTOD tests, and the links to non-metallic particle density with respect to fracture toughness and CTOD at initiation. Some of their findings with regards to the effect of pre-strain on CTOD initiation were subsequently found to confirm the experimental findings in this study. No effective methodology for prediction of pre-necking or running fracture in a structural member or assembly when subjected to gross plastic cyclic deformation was found to exist in the literature.  It was concluded however that the principles of specific work of fracture, and monotonic and cyclic fracture similitude were particularly relevant.  These were therefore utilised in the development of the design method proposed in this thesis.  The CTOD test results were reviewed, isolating the remote plastic flow component, to determine the critical specific work of fracture property Rc of the steels tested. A meeting with Professor Kuwamura at the University of Tokyo was providential, allowing discussion of his similitude principle, and observations in person of some of the fractured specimens developed during his full scale test series&#8217;.  Running fractures with cleavage were evident in the specimens, with their tell-tale chevron markings. He had predicted running fracture problems in structures in Japan ahead of the Kobe earthquake and been largely ignored.  His insights were subsequently seriously considered in Japan after the earthquake. He and his colleagues developed the principle of structural similitude that relates monotonic fracture displacement ductility to cyclic fracture displacement ductility for a particular assembly.  This arose from their observation that running fractures developed from ductile crack formation at blunt notches in structures.  The similitude principle has echoes of the Coffin-Manson approach to ductile crack initiated low cycle fracture.  The principle of similitude has a log&#8211;log relationship as does the Manson-Coffin relationship.  So where notch plasticity controls the initiation of fracture in a structural assembly it is conceptually reasonable to expect that the number of cycles to initiation of fracture from a notch will have a log&#8211;log relationship to the amplitude of the cyclic strain developed in the notch. Kuwamura found that steel assemblies with lower CVN energy had reduced cyclic fracture endurance than the same assemblies made with steel with higher CVN impact energy.  However no method of predicting performance of any particular assembly could be developed from his observations.  The benefit of his method primarily relates to the minimising of testing necessary to assess the fracture limited cyclic displacement ductility of a structural assembly.  However it doesn&#8217;t provide a means for designing a structural assembly to achieve specific levels of ductile endurance other than clearly identifying the need to use steel with good CVN characteristics. The most significant development arising from this thesis is therefore the development of a design method to assess cyclic ductile endurance.  The method utilises the specific work of fracture properties obtained from CTOD specimens of the steel in conjunction with a relatively simple fracture mechanics assessment and an elasto-plastic finite element analysis (FEA).  The FEA model is used to determine the displacement ductility of the assembly at the calculated onset of pre-necking fracture.  The elasto-plastic stress&#8211;strain properties of the steel in various pre-strain states required for the FEA may be derived from tensile testing.  Kuwamura&#8217;s similitude principle is then used to predict cyclic plastic endurance at various constant displacement ductility amplitudes.  The method is extended using Miner&#8217;s rule to allow for the effects of increasing variable amplitude cyclic plastic loading. In summary the thesis explains why pre-necking and running fractures occur in steel members subjected to cyclic plastic deformation during a severe earthquake.  In addition a method for consistently assessing the ability of structural steel assemblies to achieve a specified level of ductile endurance during earthquakes is proposed.  The method is verified against published results for a cyclic test of a simple steel member with a crack at mid-span.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">structures</field><field name="subject">constructional steel</field><field name="subject">seismic</field><field name="subject">specific work of fracture</field><field name="subject">CTOD</field><field name="subject">charpy v-notch</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">similitude</field><field name="subject">manson-coffin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the role of Customers and other external influencers in radical new product development &#8211; a network approach</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Richard</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this thesis is to extend our understanding of radical new product development (NPD) beyond degree of customer orientation (CO) by assessing the role and influence of both customers and other external influencers (OEIs). While a number of studies have investigated the relationship between CO and NPD outcomes, such studies typically focus on incremental NPD. The role of customers is also typically investigated using numerical scales to understand degree of CO, and fails to consider the important implementation issues of which, when and how customers are involved through the NPD process. In addition to customers, other external influencers (OEIs) such as investors, suppliers, distributors, competitors, universities and advisors are also increasingly involved in radical NPD, but the roles and actual influence of these different groups is unclear. To address these gaps in the literature this thesis adopts a network approach to investigate the role of customers and OEIs in the development of six radical new products. Six retrospective case studies are conducted, all involving the development of radical ICT products targeted at industrial markets. To provide further insight, three of these cases involve successful new products while the remaining three involve unsuccessful products. Analysis of case data involves qualitative and quantitative network analysis as well as thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Clear differences are found between the ways in which the successful and unsuccessful cases involve customers and OEIs. For example, firms developing successful products focus on existing customers with whom they have strong previous relationships, while developers of unsuccessful products do not. Furthermore, the successful cases all involve customers actively as co-developers of the product, while none of the unsuccessful cases take this approach. These findings are presented in detail and discussed in relation to the existing literature. A set of empirically-based propositions are outlined as a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radical new product development (NPD)</field><field name="subject">customer orientation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural products from New Zealand Latrunculia species sponges</field><field name="creator">Grkovic, Tanja</field><field name="description">In a survey of the secondary metabolite chemistry profiles of ten New Zealand, one Antarctic and one South African-sourced collections of Latrunculia spp. sponges, eighteen discorhabdin alkaloids have been isolated. Four of those, namely discorhabdin K, 3-dihydro discorhabdin A, 1-thiomethyl discorhabdin G*/I, and 16a,17a-dehydro discorhabdin W were fully characterized as new natural products in the series. In addition, for the first time, five enantiomeric pairs and two sets of diastereomers of the naturallyoccurring discorhabdin alkaloids were identified. The absolute configuration of all of the chiral compounds isolated, including new natural products, has been established upon comparison of the observed experimental data with the results of time dependant density functional theory calculations of the electronic circular dichroism spectra. A structure activity relationship study on discorhabdin B, the main natural product of the Wellington-sourced sponges, has identified four reactive centres on the molecule and yielded nine novel semi-synthetic derivatives. Consequently, a new discorhabdin biosynthetic tree was proposed which highlighted discorhabdin B as a crucial precursor to a number of other naturally-occurring analogues. The importance of the iminoquinone moiety and the spirodienone ring with respect to the bioactivity of the compounds in a range of naturally-occurring discorhabdins was demonstrated. A new semi-synthetic derivative, 1-discorhabdyl discorhabdin D, was identified as a potent anti-malarial agent and has opened new possibilities for the therapeutic development of the discorhabdin alkaloids.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland suburbs coronary study</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Gary E.</field><field name="description">The Auckland Suburbs Coronary Study is designed to provide information concerning acute coronary events in Auckland. Within New Zealand, information Previously depended on either hospital data or death certificate data. The present study is community based and has provided more extensive information than has previously been available. A random sample of 125 primary care doctors was selected. The patients of these doctors were considered a random sample of the community and formed the study population. The size of this population was estimated using a postal survey, taking names from the electoral roll. A statistical theory is developed to allow a confidence interval to be placed about the maximum likelihood estimate. Hypothesis testing theory is applied to the problem of comparing disease frequencies at different locations or at different times at the same location. During overlapping one year periods, 293 cases of definite myocardial infarction, 178 cases of sudden cardiac death and 99 cases of possible myocardial infarction were collected. Information concerning demographic variables, past and prodromal medical histories, the acute event, the electrocardiograph, cardiac enzymes, mortality within 28 days and postmortem results, was collected As about 80% of sudden deaths are all over before any help is sought and in view of the geographic nature of Auckland city the utility of &#8216;cardiac arrest&#8217; ambulances would not seem to be great. For sudden deaths surviving longer than five minutes after onset (about 50% of total) there was a significant tendency for there to be a lower social class predominance. This may imply inadequacies of acute health care--either availability or notification. Persons dying suddenly differed from persons experiencing definite myocardial infarction (but not dying suddenly) by experiencing less prodromal chest pain, taking digoxin and frusemide more frequently, consuming more alcohol and the acute event occurring in the cooler months proportionately more often. At postmortem, they had significantly more myocardial scarring and/or fibrosis. Persons experiencing definite myocardial infarction differed from persons experiencing possible myocardial infarction (who did not die suddenly) by being more likely a male, having less history of past acute coronary insufficiency, using less of beta-blocking drugs or frusemide/ethacrynic acid and describing prodromal lethargy less frequently. Clinical shock was more common in the acute phase and death more common in the succeeding 30 days. Persons dying suddenly differed from those suffering possible myocardial infarction (but not dying suddenly) by being older, more likely to be male and less likely to have had chest pain in the prodrome. The data could be interpreted as suggesting that a separate primary myocardial process is contributing towards sudden death. Alcohol may be a risk factor for sudden death. A hypothesis is, that in the presence of acute infarction, a history of chronic, moderate to high alcohol intake is associated with an increased likelihood of sudden death.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy for multiple sclerosis fatigue: a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Van Kessel, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Aim Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with fatigue being one of the least understood symptoms. Based on a systematic review of the literature, a cognitive behavioural model of MS fatigue was developed and used to design a manualised eight session cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention to treat MS fatigue. The purpose of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the efficacy of CBT compared to relaxation training (RT) to treat fatigue in MS. Methods Seventy-two patients with MS fatigue were randomly assigned to either eight sessions of CBT or eight sessions of RT, designed to control for therapist time and attention. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at three and six months follow-up. Primary outcomes included the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS). Secondary outcomes included measures of fatigue related impairment, mood, stress, sleep problems and daytime sleepiness. Seventy of the 72 participants completed all therapy sessions and 69 participants completed all assessments. Results Analyses were carried out by intention-to-heat. There was a significant group by time interaction for fatigue, indicating that the CBT group had significantly greater reductions in fatigue severity than the RT group (p&lt;.02). A-priori contrasts showed that this significant effect was largely accounted for by changes between baseline and end of treatment (P&lt;.00). By six month follow-up improvement in fatigue was equivalent in both groups. The key mechanism of improvement in fatigue severity during CBT was a positive change in schematic beliefs about fatigue. At the end of treatment 88.6% of the CBT group rated themselves as improved compared to 73% of the RT group, but this difference was not significant (p&lt;.09). Both groups improved on almost all secondary outcomes, with the CBT participants improving more significantly on depression, anxiety and stress between baseline and end of treatment (p&lt;.05). Conclusions CBT appears to be an effective treatment for MS fatigue, with CBT participants improving significantly more on fatigue than RT participants between baseline and end of treatment. Obtained effect sizes for fatigue in both CBT and RT were considerably larger than those in previous controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Both groups improved on almost all of the secondary outcomes. Findings support the relevance of a cognitive behavioural model for MS fatigue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gap junctions in the lens: is location everything?</field><field name="creator">Sisley, Aran Mathew George</field><field name="description">The primary function of the ocular lens is as a light-focusing structure. To this end the lens is avascular, with a highly ordered arrangement of cells that acts to reduce light scattering. However, the avascular nature of the lens presents the problem of supplying cells deep within the lens with nutrients and removing waste products of cellular metabolism, i.e. maintaining cellular homeostasis, To solve this problem the lens possesses intercellular channels, called gap junctions, that facilitate cell-to-cell communication and are regulated by changes in the subcellular distribution and age dependent processing of the gap junction protein subunits, called connexins. The lens expresses three types of connexins (Cx): Cx43 in the anterior surface epithelial cells and connexins 46 and 50 in the fibre cells. Therefore, to fully examine the role of GJs in lens homeostasis, regional differences in GJ structure and function need to be quantified. In this thesis I present the results of experiments designed to map the differentiation dependent changes to subcellular distribution and posttranslational processing of Cx46 and Cx50 in mouse and rat lenses. My results quantitatively show for the first time that Cx50 undergoes two discrete cleavage events in a similar manner to that previously shown for Cx46, and that qualitatively Cx46 does the same in the mouse lens' Such posttranslational processing has important effects on the proposed lens circulation model (Mathias et al., 1997) that accounts for lens homeostasis. In addition, I have examined the functional contribution of gap junctions to localized intercellular communication in different regions of wildtype and Cx46-KO mouse lenses, using highly localised uncaging of fluorescein with Two-Photon Excited Flash Photolysis (TPEFP) in half lenses, The results of these experiments have provided the first supporting evidence for a macromolecule-permeable pathway, previously suggested by Shestoplaov and Bassnett (2000, 2003), that acts in conjunction with gap junctions to facilitate intercellular communication in the lens core. My results show that this pathway acts at a localised level to confer cell-to-cell communication that is as effective as that mediated by gap junctions, and therefore a re-evaluation of current models of lens homeostasis is now required.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrauterine growth retardation in the rat: effects on the somatotrophic axis and postnatal sequelae</field><field name="creator">Woodall, Sonja Mary</field><field name="description">Over the past decade, a number of epidemiological studies have provided significant evidence that certain major adult noncommunicable diseases, such as hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, may be associated with impaired fetal growth. This phenomenon has been termed "programming" which is essentially the term used for persisting changes in structure and function caused by undernutrition or other adverse influences acting during critical periods of early development. Programming has been used as the mechanistic basis to explain the long term sequelae of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The mechanisms underlying the epidemiological observations remain to be elucidated and developed. While it is well established that severe maternal undernutrition during pregnancy leads to IUGR, there has been relatively little well defined animal studies of the somatotrophic axis and postnatal development of growth retarded offspring. The major objectives of this thesis were to establish a model in the rat of IUGR by nutritional restriction of the dam throughout gestation and to examine the effects of fetal growth retardation on endocrine, molecular and growth parameters during postnatal development. In addition, the development of an animal model for IUGR enabled well defined studies testing distinct hypotheses suggested by the epidemiological observations of professor David Barker and colleagues. Timed matings were performed in Wistar rats and dams were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatment groups. A control group was fed ad libitum throughout pregnancy and a restricted group was fed 30% of ad libitum intake. Restricted fed dams were observed to lose a significant amount of body weight throughout gestation, due to undernutrition, but caught up to the ad libitum group during the lactating period. Maternal undernutrition significantly reduced fetal and placental weights without altering litter size. Postnatally, body weights of offspring from undernourished dams continued to be reduced until at least 18 weeks of age, although they were observed to be growing at the same rate as ad libitum offspring by 2 weeks of age. A cohort of animals from undernourished dams were maintained to measure blood pressure by tail cuff plethysmography. Offspring from undernourished dams were found to have significantly elevated systolic blood pressures from 18 weeks of age. This observation provides direct experimental support for the hypothesis, derived from human epidemiological studies, that the origin of adult hypertension may originate during fetal life as a result of exposure to a sub-optimal intrauterine environment. Parallel reductions in plasma IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I mRNA concentrations before 15 days of age were also observed in growth retarded offspring. Hepatic IGF-I transcription start sites within exon 1 and exon 2 were coordinately reduced with IUGR up to 15 days of age without changes in GHR and GHBP mRNA abundance. The lack of catch-up growth observed in the IUGR offspring despite normalization of their plasma IGF-I and IGF-I mRNA levels from 15 days of age may be due to a state of partial resistance to GH. This observation lead to a series of treatment studies in which neonatal and juvenile offspring from ad libitum and undernourished dams were treated with growth factors to investigate somatic growth responses as a measure for hormone sensitivity. In both treatment studies, ad libitum offspring from both age groups and juvenile IUGR offspring responded to GH treatment However, neonatal IUGR offspring did not exhibit any response to GH treatment.. Analysis of IGF-I gene expression in neonatal offspring showed that GH treatment elevated IGF-I Eb mRNA in ad libitum but not IUGR offspring. These results suggest a possible mechanism for transient GH resistance in that a post-receptor defect in GH action may contribute to the development of temporary postnatal GH resistance as a consequence of IUGR and fetal programming of IGF-I gene expression. In summary, the development of a model of IUGR in the rat using maternal undernutrition throughout gestation has enabled detailed investigation of nutritional regulation of the somatotrophic axis during fetal development and postnatal sequelae. The studies in this thesis have shown that the somatotrophic axis is markedly altered postnatally by nutritional restriction of the dam throughout gestation, leading to prolonged postnatal growth retardation and elevated blood pressure The mechanisms which lead to the induction of such fetal programming and whether these changes may contribute to the development of subsequent adult-onset disease remain to be addressed in future studies.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological investigations of the experience of chronic pain</field><field name="creator">James, Frances Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on two theoretical models of chronic illness: Large, Butler, James, and Peters (1990) introduced a systems model of musculo-skeletal pain which incorporated many of the variables believed to be important in the development and maintenance of pain. Feldman&#8217;s model (1974) addressed the difficulties of adapting to chronic illness. Five studies evaluated specific aspects of these models. The epidemiology of pain in New Zealand (NZ) was derived from a psychiatric epidemiology project. Approximately 80% of NZ adults had experienced a life disrupting episode of pain which had required medical consultation. Subjects who reported episodes of pain were more likely to have psychiatric diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and phobia. They were more likely to describe their health as poor and were currently consulting their doctor more than people who did not report an experience of pain. The estimated average cost of health consulting by people attending Auckland Hospital Pain Clinic (AHPC) for the previous year was $1333(NZ). Most people had some subsidy of costs. The health consulting of the AHPC group was higher than that reported in the NZ health literature. Self image and the experience of pain were assessed in two studies. The first asked subjects at AHPC to describe the typical thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, of someone with chronic pain. Subjects described loss of self esteem, alienation from family and friends, fear of the future, frustration and anger. The descriptions focused on psychological aspects of the experience of pain. The second study of self image used repertory grid technique. Two standardised Illness Self Construct Repertory Grids (ISCRG) were evaluated. Issues in the use of standardised grids are discussed and some aspects of ISCRG application are explored. The two ISCRG indicated subjects often identified themselves as a physically ill person and felt isolated from others. People with pain and their "closest other&#8221; (CO) completed the ISCRG(A) and questionnaires on the quality of their relationship. Closest others overestimated the role of the physical illness in their partners&#8217; life and believed that they understood them better than the individual with pain thought they did. The personality dimensions of alexithymia and hypnotisability have been hypothesised as pathways for the development of psychosomatic illness. Individuals with chronic pain were tested to establish whether they weremore alexithymic and more hypnotisable than subjects in a general population control group. This was not verified. The constructs of alexithymia and hypnotisability require critical examination. The experience of pain is common and is associated with psychological distress and high health service use. Self construct appears to be a major factor determining response to pain and to treatment programmes. Chronic pain appears to be a particular challenge for individuals who must accept alteration in their lifestyle with perhaps little understanding of what the future may hold.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Purinergic signalling in peripheral auditory neurotransmission</field><field name="creator">Salih, Salam Gheyath Al-Din</field><field name="description">P2X receptors, forming ATP-gated ion channels, mediate fast neurotransmission in the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. Preliminary evidence indicated the presence of P2X receptors in the cochlea, with a possible involvement in the neurohumoral regulation of hearing function. This study investigated the hypothesis that extracellular ATP acts as an auditory neurotransmitter or neuromodulator within the inner ear. RT-PCR analysis of rat spiral ganglion neurones (SGN), which innervate the sensory hair cells of the cochlea, detected the expression of three different isoforms of the P2X2 receptor subunit, including a novel functional isoform (designated P2X2-3R). Cellular localisation of the P2X2R subunit mRNA in SGN somata was demonstrated by direct in situ RT-PCR. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry studies using P2X2 receptor-specific antisera, confirmed the expression of the P2X2R protein by SGN somata, and also showed localisation at the region of spiral ganglion neurone synapse with the inner and outer hair cells. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from cultured post-natal rat SGN demonstrated ATP-activated currents with heterogeneous phenotypes. This is consistent with the functional expression of P2X2R subunit isoforms, and co-expression of additional P2X receptor subunits. However, in situ recordings, using a rat cochlear slice preparation, demonstrated a homogeneous phenotype of ATP-gated current, suggesting heteromultimeric assembly of P2X receptor subunits that is specifically regulated in vivo. Employing a multi-disciplinary approach, the present study provides substantial evidence for a purinergic mode of neurotransmission within the peripheral auditory system. This occurs via ATP-gated ion channels in spiral ganglion neurones, arising from a tightly regulated expression of a specific P2X receptor phenotype.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myocardial force and intracellular Ca2+ in an animal model of hypertensive heart failure</field><field name="creator">Ward, Marie-Louise</field><field name="description">Hypertensive heart failure has long been associated with diminished cardiac contractile function, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this Thesis was to investigate the relationship between intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and isometric force during the relatively narrow time frame in which long-standing compensated hypertrophy progresses to decompensated end-stage heart failure in an animal model of human essential hypertension. In order to carry out this aim, left ventricular trabeculae were utilized from failing hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. At a physiological stimulation frequency (5 Hz), and temperature (37 &#176;C), the peak stress of SHR trabeculae was significantly reduced compared to WKY, although no differences in the time-course of the twitch were detected. Measurements using fura-2/AM as an index of intracellular [Ca2+] showed that, for SHR, both the peak of the Ca2+ transient and the resting [Ca2+]i were increased and the decay of the Ca2+ transient was prolonged compared to WKY. This unexpected result, i.e. depression of twitch force despite an increased Ca2+ transient, was investigated further by utilizing experimental protocols known to affect [Ca2+]i and force. Varying extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) between 0.5 and 5 mM showed that the reduction of force development by SHR trabeculae was not associated with reduced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, since, although peak [Ca2+]i continued to increase with increasing [Ca2+]o, peak stress reached a plateau. Investigation of the force-frequency response between 0.2 and 10 Hz showed that the mismatch in peak Ca2+ and peak force was apparent across all frequencies for SHR. A consistent finding of studies that have made measurement of [Ca2+]i in failing myocardium is that the decay of intracellular Ca2+ following SR release is prolonged. Additionally, expression levels of the SR Ca2+ -ATPase have been reported as reduced, in conjunction with increased expression of the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Although the decay of fluorescence was slower for SHR in this study, no experimental evidence was found to suggest that sarcolemmal Ca2+ extrusion was increased in SHR in comparison to WKY. The re-circulation fraction of activator Ca2+ during recovery from potentiation was not different between rat strains, indicating that SL Ca2+ extrusion was not increased in SHR. Additionally, the decay of fluorescence remained slower for SHR even when the SR Ca2+ -ATPase contribution was functionally removed. Inhibition of the SL Ca2+ -ATPase, together with the functional removal of the SR, removed the differences in the decay of fluorescence between rat strains. A decrease in the sarcolemmal extrusion of [Ca2+]i by the Ca2+ -.ATPase might therefore explain the observed differences in the resting [Ca2+]i and in the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient between rat strains. In summary, this study has provided the first measurements of [Ca2+]i and isometric force carried out at physiological temperature and stimulation frequency in LV trabeculae from failing SHR hearts and their age-matched, normotensive, WKY controls. Most importantly, for this animal model the contractile dysfunction typical of heart failure is not associated with reduced availabilty of [Ca2+]i. Instead it is suggested that contractile function is compromised in these LV trabeculae by the increased collagen, and its three-dimensional organisation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting information cues and share price revisions</field><field name="creator">Emanuel, D.M (David Munroe), 1944-</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of certain identifiable subsets of accounting information on users&#8217; decisions by examining share price revisions that occurred at the same time as the accounting information was released. The subsets examined are the announcements of new share issues, the release of contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements, and the release of information about asset revaluations. Assuming that an adequate methodology can be designed, a significant share price revision is consistent with the notion that the accounting information cue has "information content". The distinction between accounting research and research in the basic disciplines of economics and mathematics/statistics is the emphasis in accounting on the institutional domain; that is research in accounting requires a "mapping" into the institutional domain in which accounting information is produced and used. This, in turn, provides a justification for the type of announcement effect studies described in the previous paragraph. Clearly the study of share price revisions requires a substantial data base of share prices. Part of this thesis is devoted to a description of the procedures used to establish this data base. The three major announcement effect studies use what is popularly described as the market model residual method of analysis. In the application of this model, some attention has been paid to problems of "thin" trading in the New Zealand environment in providing unbiased estimators of the market model parameters. The results of the application of this methodology are that share prices seem to react rapidly and (generally) unbiasedly to the announcement of bonus issues and contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements. The size of the reaction in the week that the announcement is made is typically large. The larger is the unexpected component in the announcement of earnings, the larger is the share price revision. With regard to rights issues, no abnormal share price performance was found in the week that the rights issue was announced, although it was clear that companies announcing rights issues had been performing abnormally well over the year up to the announcement. Share price revisions did not appear to accompany the release of information about the current values of assets (usually land and buildings). However it is conceded that this subset of the overall research exercise is more difficult to undertake as there are difficulties in determining an appropriate announcement date, and in determining what the market&#8217;s expectations are with regard to the revaluation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermoreception, thermoregulation and the early thermal environment</field><field name="creator">Young, Andrew</field><field name="description">Previous investigations1,2 have shown that the capacity of rats and rabbits reared at an elevated environmental temperature to thermoregulate in the cold is impaired. This impairment appears permanent and is associated with other thermoregulatory dysfunction (altered febrile response and altered response to intrahypothalamic noradrenaline injection). The present study investigated the role of the thermal environment in the development of thermoregulatory function by studying the performance of the intact thermoregulatory system and components thereof at different levels of processing of thermal information (thermoreceptive, early integrative and effector levels). The present study confirmed the impaired capacity of heat-reared rats to maintain colonic temperature in the cold and future indicated that this was likely to be attributable to active rather than passive components of the thermoregulatory system. Exposure to an environmental temperature of 20&#176;C for 20 days was able to prevent thermoregulatory dysfunction (as assessed by intrahypothalamic noradrenaline injection) if it occurred after about 14 days of age. Exposure to 20&#176;C was progressively less effective in averting thermoregulatory dysfunction after about 60-80 days of age. The experimental design identified these effects as being of environmental rather than genetic origin. Thermal information processing at the level of the caudal trigeminal nucleus resembled that described at thermoreceptors. The static and dynamic responses of thermoreceptive neurones at this level were quantified and found not to differ between 20&#176;C &#8211; and 30&#176;C-reared rats. The distribution of facial thermal receptive fields and the projections of these at the caudal trigeminal nucleus were mapped and also found not to differ. Thermal information originating from truncal skin was intercepted at a midline midbrain level. Data presented here suggested that the sites at which this thermal information could be intercepted included but probably were not restricted to the raphe nuclci. Both warm- and cold-responsive units were present at the midbrain. The abundance of thermoresponsive units was the same in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C-reared rat as was the ratio of warm:cold-responsive units. The stimulus configurations by which responses of midbrain thermoresponsive units could be characterised were more complex than at the caudal trigeminal nuclcus. Thermal responses were principally static with little response to temperature change. The pooled static responses of warm- and cold-responsive units over the 5-45&#176;C range were the same in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C-reared rats. The cutaneous receptive fields at the midbrain level were diffuse, covering most of the truncal surface. There was an almost universal and consistent interaction with noxious input at midbrain thermoresponsive units. Warm-responsive units were inhibited by simultaneous noxious stimulation at almost any body site while the activity of cold-responsive units was augmented by such stimulation. At the thermoeffector level, noradrenaline-induced thermogenesis was equal in 20&#176;C- and 30&#176;C- reared rats. Heat-rearing was not observed to produce identifiable effects on the peripheral processing of thermal information, either at the afferent or efferent limbs of the thermoregulatory system. Heat-rearing does however produce changes in thermophysiological responses that are primarily mediated via a central mechanism (responses to intrahypothalamic noradrenaline, febrile response). It is therefore surmised that alterations in thermoregulatory function following heat-rearing are attributable to changes in central rather than peripheral processing of thermal information. 1 Cooper et al., (1980) J Physiol [ Lond ] 303: 165-172 2 Ferguson et al., (1981) Can J Physiol Pharmacol 59: 91-95</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Significance testing in automatic interaction detection (A.I.D.)</field><field name="creator">Worsley, Keith John</field><field name="description">Automatic Interaction Detection (A.I.D.) is the name of a computer program, first used in the social sciences, to find the interaction between a set of predictor variables and a single dependent variable. The program proceeds in stages, and at each stage the categories of a predictor variable induce a split of the dependent variable into two groups, so that the between groups sum of squares ( BSS ) is a maximum. In this way, the optimum split defines the interaction between predictor and dependent variable, and the criterion BSS is taken as a measure of the explanatory power of the split. One of the strengths of A.I.D. is that this interaction is established without any reference to a specific model, and for this reason it is widely used in practice. However this strength is also its weakness; with no model there is no measure of its significance. Barnard (1974) has said: &#8220;&#8230; nowadays with more and more apparently sophisticated computer programs for social science, failure to take account of possible sampling fluctuations is leading to a glut of unsound analyses &#8230; I have in mind procedures such as A.I.D., the automatic interaction detector, which guarantees to get significance out of any data whatsoever. Methods of this kind require validation &#8230;&#8221; The aim of this thesis is to supply Part of that validation by investigating the null distribution of the optimum BSS for a single predictor at a single stage of A.I.D., so that the significance of any particular split can be judged. The problem of the overall significance of a complete A.I.D. analysis, combining many stages, still remains to be solved. In Chapter 1 the A.I.D. method is described in more detail and an example is presented to illustrate its use. A null hypothesis that the dependent variable observations have independent and identical normal distributions is proposed as a model for no interaction. In Chapters 2 and 3 the null distributions of the optimum BSS for a single predictor are derived and tables of percentage points are given. In Chapter 4 the normal assumption is dropped and non-parametric A.I.D. criteria, based on ranks, are proposed. Tables of percentage points, found by direct enumeration and by Monte Carlo methods, are given. In Chapter 5 the example presented in Chapter 1 is used to illustrate the application of the theory and tables in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 and some final conclusions are drawn.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-schedule performance in closed economies</field><field name="creator">Elliffe, Douglas Mark</field><field name="description">Experimental preparations may be divided into two categories, called open and closed economies. In an open economy, the extent to which the subject is deprived of the scheduled reinforcer, most commonly food, is controlled by the experimenter. This is usually done by manipulating the amount of free food given to the subject after each experimental session. Consumption of the reinforcer is thus independent of behaviour during the session. By contrast, in a closed economy, no alternative source of the reinforcer is available outside the session. Consumption of the reinforcer is thus completely determined by the subject&#8217;s interaction with the experimental environment. This may be done by having the subject live permanently within the experiment and receive all its food as reinforcers for responding on continuously available schedules. Most research in the experimental analysis of behaviour has been carried out within open economies, but it can be argued that the natural environment, as a whole, is better represented by a closed economy. Several experimental findings obtained within open economies have been shown not to be replicable within closed economies. In the present series of experiments, three pigeons received their total daily intake of food as reinforcers for responding on continuously available multiple variable-interval schedules. The relation between the allocation of responding between components of a multiple schedule and the distribution of reinforcers can be conveniently described by the generalised matching law, which states that the ratio of component response rates is a power function of the ratio of component reinforcer rates. In an open economy, the power, called sensitivity, is typically less than 1.0. This is called undermatching. Experiment 1 of the present series found sensitivity values substantially greater than 1.0.This is called overmatching. One procedural variable known to control sensitivity in open economies is level of deprivation. Experiments 2 to 5 examined the effect of deprivation in a closed economy. In Experiments 2 and 3, increasing deprivation by means of decreasing session duration produced decreases in sensitivity. In Experiment 4, increasing deprivation by decreasing overall reinforcer rate in continuous sessions had no effect on sensitivity. In Experiment 5, deprivation was held constant by changing session duration and overall reinforcer rate in opposite directions. Sensitivity increased with increasing session duration and decreasing overall reinforcer rate. Taken together, these results suggest that multiple-schedule sensitivity increases with decreasing deprivation, with decreasing overall reinforcer rate, and as the economy for reinforcers other than those arranged by the experimenter (extraneous reinforcers) becomes more closed. A quantitative model of multiple-schedule performance, elaborated from that of McLean and White (1983), was developed to account for these effects. In this model, response allocation is governed by the concurrent choice between scheduled-and extraneous-reinforcer rates within each component. The total rate of extraneous reinforcement is affected by both deprivation and economy, and the distribution of extraneous reinforcers between components depends inversely on the distribution of scheduled reinforcers. Unlike other published models, this model predicts overmatching in the present experiments. Quantitatively, the model accounts for both the present closed-economy data and published data from open-economy multiple schedules as well as does the generalised matching law, and better than does its most influential competitor, Herrnstein&#8217;s (1970) equation. Finally, it is proposed that, while the economy for scheduled reinforcers is important to understanding total response output on multiple schedules, the economy for extraneous reinforcers has much more influence on the allocation of that responding between components.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of electrocortical dynamics</field><field name="creator">Liley, David T. J.</field><field name="description">Computational and continuum models of electrocortical activity are developed in order to better understand the genesis and significance of the major mammalian cerebral rhythms. The computational model was developed to investigate the relationship between individual neuron behaviour and population electrical dynamics. Networks of multicompartment excitatory and inhibitory neurons incorporating &#8220;fast" synaptic transmission were coupled together using an anatomically derived scheme of asymmetric intracortical axosynaptic connectivity. Results showed that such networks are capable of oscillating at frequencies frequently observed in mammalian electroencephalogram (EEG). The relationship of individual neuron behaviour to mean network activity was investigated by generating Conditional Pulse Probability Surfaces. Derived results exhibited a near linear relationship between the probability of a pyramidal cell firing and the extant value of the local field potential (LFP), similar to that seen in experimental studies involving cortical neurons. In contrast the continuum model considered neural tissue to be a continuous one-dimensional chain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons interacting by way of short (intra-cortical) and long (isotropic cortico-cortical) fibres. The defining non-linear integral equations were linearised such that Fourier-Laplace techniques could be applied to investigate potential solutions. Numerical solutions revealed the prescence of, spatially, weakly damped travelling waves at or near the frequencies of mammalian alpha (8-13 Hz). Biasing the excitatory cell population was shown to have a dominant effect in determining spatio-temporal damping of travelling wave solutions, whereas applying bias to the inhibitory cell population had a dominant effect in specifying the corresponding spatio-temporal frequencies. The possibility that such bias may be due to, and regulated by, subcortical efferents is discussed. Finally it is suggested that the alpha rhythm may be an important synchronising agent for coordinating widespread cortical activity.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High frequency power transistor model</field><field name="creator">Egan, Brian</field><field name="description">The development of a large-signal power transistor model applicable at radio frequencies is described. This model which has its basis in the classical large-signal models is valid for cut-off and active region operation but does not include saturation operation. The model is intended primarily for use in broadband linear radio frequency amplifier applications and is useful up to frequencies of the order of 1/15 f&#9516;. The model is described by two first order nonlinear differential equations and a number of algebraic equations. Equation coefficients are determined from measurements made on the devices under study. Two methods are described for the solution of the model equations. The first and principal method is an iterative one requiring computer assistance whilst the second is analytical and depends upon piecewise linearisation of the device transfer characteristic. This analytical method whilst in some respects inadequate, e.g. distortion level predictions, is easy to implement and despite its limitations affords useful insight into output power capability and frequency limitations of specific devices. The model contains all transistor nonlinearities and parasitic elements of significance and an important feature is the inclusion of device temperature as a model variable, resulting in good accuracy over a wide range of operating conditions. A simplified input impedance representation is evolved and it is demonstrated that input impedance measurements provide a useful window on model structure and aid in the evaluation of parameter values.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of some of the factors concerned in the natural regeneration of the kauri (Agathis australis)</field><field name="creator">Mirams, Rex Valentine, 1925-</field><field name="description">New Zealand is a land with a unique and very diversified flora which, along with the great range of habitats to be found throughout the country, has given rise to some remarkable plant communities.

Bowlby&#8217;s (1982) attachment theory implies that optimal outcomes are associated with an attachment relationship that is characterised by a confidence in the accessibility and responsiveness of the caregiver. Three studies were designed to explore changes in New Zealand adolescents&#8217; perceptions of their attachment to mothers, fathers, and friends, and the relative impact of these relationships on three measures of self esteem. Two dimensions of the attachment relationship were assessed, the utilisation of emotional support and proximity, and the quality of affect. Study 1 (n = 180) revealed that although adolescents utilised their mothers for support and proximity more than their fathers, and perceived their mothers as more responsive than fathers, they did not differ in their quality of affect towards their parents. Friends were utilised significantly more in support seeking situations than in proximity seeking situations. Study 2 (n = 493) revealed that male and female adolescents differed in their perceptions of their attachment to mothers in late adolescence. With increasing age, females reported that they would utilise maternal support and proximity more, whereas males reported utilising their mothers less in both types of situation. However, both male and female adolescents continued to report a high quality of affect towards their mothers throughout adolescence. No differences were found in male and female adolescents' perceptions of their attachment to fathers. With increasing age, males and females utilised paternal support and proximity less, and reported a lower quality of affect towards their fathers. Adolescents continued to utilise their friends highly for support throughout adolescence, and increased their utilisation of friends for proximity as they got older. Regardless of age, females reported a higher quality of affect towards their friends than males. These findings suggested that substantial changes take place in attachment relationships from early to late adolescence, and that these changes are affected by the sex of the adolescent and the sex of the parent. Further analyses revealed that Pacific Island adolescents utilised their mothers significantly less for support than European/Pakeha adolescents. Adolescents from one-parent families utilised their fathers significantly less for support and proximity, and had a lower quality of affect towards them than adolescents from two-parent families. The utilisation of support and proximity from mothers, fathers, and friends was minimally related to overall self esteem, coping abilities and social competence. The quality of affect towards mothers and fathers was significantly related to all three measures of self esteem, whereas the quality of affect towards friends was significantly related only to social competence. Adolescent attachment to parents appears to exert a relatively stronger effect on self esteem than adolescent attachment to friends, regardless of the sex or age of the adolescent. Study 3 (n = 80) examined the main reasons for utilising parents and friends for emotional support, and for feeling close to parents and friends. Content analysis revealed that the reasons did not differ according to the age or sex of the adolescent but varied according to the attachment figure. Overall, the three studies revealed that New Zealand adolescents&#8217; descriptions of their relationships with parents and friends differed at both the cognitive-affective and behavioural levels of attachment. The divergent patterns of support seeking and proximity seeking highlighted these differences, and clearly illustrated the need to distinguish these two aspects of the behavioural dimension of attachment in adolescence. The implications of the findings for adolescent attachment to parents and friends are considered, and future directions for research are discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the double torsion specimen to the study of fracture in fibre reinforced plastics</field><field name="creator">Brown, Niven Rhys</field><field name="description">The increasing use of fibre reinforced polymers in structural components often requires an accurate assessment of the strength of the component. The strength of composite materials is usually based on the strength of an individual lamina. This is then combined in a manner depending on the orientation of the plies within the laminate. The actual failure process is often ignored in this type of analysis. Composite failure is the result of damage accumulation from a number of failure modes, in particular, fibre failure, matrix failure and failure of the interface between the fibres and matrix. Measurement of the interfacial strength requires specialised testing techniques in order to obtain accurate characterization of the interfacial failure processes. This research uses a double torsion specimen reinforced with fibres in a number of configurations. The testing techniques developed allow the interaction of a matrix crack with fibres, resulting in the failure of the interface. Finite element analysis has been used to gain an insight into the deformation mechanisms. A compliance change analysis has been developed so that the load in the fibres can be calculated. Results from the finite element analysis confirm the analytical procedures and show that, for the fibre/resin combination tested, the interface has a lower fracture toughness than the matrix material. The interaction between the fibres and matrix shows that the mechanism of fibre bridging inhibits the propagation of matrix cracks. This produces an apparent increase in the toughness of the composite system. To confirm the failure processes occurring, the technique of acoustic emission has been used to monitor the development of the specimen failure. In line with other workers, it is shown that matrix failure produces low amplitude events and interfacial failure produces mid amplitude events. Fibre failure did not occur to any significant degree. This thesis shows how the contribution from the presence of an interface affects the fracture of composite materials and how, via the reinforced double torsion specimen, this contribution can be measured and interpreted.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of active filters: including design limitations imposed by operational amplifier characteristics</field><field name="creator">Kay, John Stephen</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is the development of an understanding of some of the Limitations involved in the design of active filters.

(Christopher Michael), 1974-ichael</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the relative importance of natural and human influences to the population and assemblage dynamics of reef fishes in northeastern New Zealand. In particular, how different reef fishes responded to the implementation of no-take and partial marine reserve protection, and physical factors responsible for spatial differences in fish abundance. Included were data from prior to the establishment of a no-take marine reserve, multiple fished reference locations, biannual sampling and the use of two independent methods to provide quantitative estimates of fish abundance and size. This combination of factors is rare in studies of marine reserves was an important strategy leading to an improved understanding of the mechanisms structuring fish communities. Responses of the reef fish assemblage to changes in fishing mortality were examined at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve. Full no-take marine reserve protection was implemented on the 1st Oct 1998 but for the prior 17 years, the Poor Knights Reserve comprised only two small no-take zones and allowed recreational fishing in the rest of the reserve. Following implementation of no-take marine reserve status the reef fish community changed rapidly; there were no obvious changes at either reference location. Species targeted by fishers, such as Pagrus auratus (snapper) and Caprodon longimanus (pink maomao), responded most strongly to protection. An increase in the density of some non-targeted species can probably be attributed to climatic effects, rather than a reduction in fishing pressure. A decline in the abundance of several species at the Poor Knights may have been a result of natural mortality, or competitive or predatory interactions with snapper. Along with human influences (fishing), physical variables are important in determining the distribution and abundance of reef fish. Four locations (two mainland and two island) were surveyed in northeastern New Zealand to determine spatial patterns for seven labrid species, one of the most abundant and widespread taxa of reef fish in New Zealand. The underlying mechanisms were then explored through an examination of the relationship between swimming ability (as examined through pectoral fin morphology), exposure and depth. Each of the four locations consistently displayed distinct labrid assemblages, likely due to the influence of the East Auckland Current. Regardless of location, there was a consistent depthrelated trend for most labrids and a trend for some species to be associated with certain levels of wave exposure. By analogy with tropical labrid assemblages, it was expected that there would be a clear relationship between pectoral fin aspect ratio and depth and/or exposure. However, this relationship was not strongly evident suggesting that wave exposure may not be as important for labrids on northeastern New Zealand reefs as hypothesised for tropical coral reef systems. The response of snapper, an important recreational and commercial finfish, was investigated following the cessation of all fishing at the Poor Knights. The rate of response of snapper to protection was rapid, in areas that had previously been partially protected as well as in those that had been fully protected from fishing, with the overall density of legal sized fish increasing by 7.4 times over 4 years, likely a result of recolonisation rather than recruitment. The 818% increase in snapper biomass has the potential to enhance areas outside or within the reserve through the export of biomass (eggs and/or larvae and adults) - the daily batch fecundity was 11 to 18 times higher at the Poor Knights compared to the reference locations. The effects of partial protection on reef fish were further examined at the Mimiwhangata Marine Park, an area where recreational fishing is permitted but all commercial fishing has been prohibited for 18 years. Snapper showed no difference in abundance or size between the Mimiwhangata Marine Park and adjacent control areas, with the density of snapper most similar to fished reference locations. The lack of any recovery by snapper within the Marine Park, despite the exclusion of commercial fishers and restrictions on recreational fishing, and results from the Poor Knights, indicates that partial fishing regulations are ineffective as conservation tools for protecting targeted species or for fish communities in general (i.e. through reduction in by-catch). Results from this study provide evidence that recreational fishing has significant impacts on reef fishes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori parents at school: the role of the M&#257;ori parent community in the delivery of te reo M&#257;ori school curriculum</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alexander George</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the results of a three-year intervention study of a group of M&#257;ori language teachers, their pupils and M&#257;ori parent communities in the Northland region of New Zealand. The study was motivated by the problem of continuing low academic achievement for M&#257;ori students in state mainstream schools. The assumption that existing teaching outputs of M&#257;ori language were quite strong and so could be used to model improvements for other school subjects and teachers to follow for M&#257;ori students was examined. In fact this was found to be a mistaken assumption as serious problems were located for the teaching of the M&#257;ori language. Two school policy areas were examined to locate possible solutions: Treaty of Waitangi policies in school charters and the operation of M&#257;ori Language Resourcing. It was found that the operation by school managements tended to exclude any active role for the M&#257;ori parent community. An action research model of intervention was designed and implemented to offer teachers in-service assistance in the provision of practice examinations to help better prepare students in their school certificate written examinations. Teachers were also encouraged to work directly with their M&#257;ori parent communities in order to improve teaching, student learning and outcomes. A case-study demonstrates that a dramatic rise in pupil performance occurred when parents worked along side the teacher in the classroom. The thesis argues that the nature of the Treaty of Waitangi provides a rationale for M&#257;ori parent participation, for direct involvement into school management (teaching issues) both for M&#257;ori students and the M&#257;ori language. It is concluded that a successful school for M&#257;ori students depends both the strength and shape of the tripartite relationship between the school, the home and the students.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed.

Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand). Key words: Cambodian refugees, forced migration, adaptation, integration, transnationalism, Buddhism, Khmer identity, community development, and community of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesozoic geology of the Matawai district, Raukumara Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Michael J.</field><field name="description">At Matawai, Raukumara Peninsula a high angle unconformity separates Cretaceous conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones from the underlying Urewera Greywacke, at least a part of which is upper Jurassic. This unconformity is believed to be of considerable significance. It represents a considerable time gap, a major deformation phase, and the initiation of a new regional sedimentation cycle. Mapping and sedimentological studies enable the recognition of two major lithostratigraphic units within Cretaceous strata at Matawai. The Aptian - Coniacian MATAWAI GROUP (new name) includes the Koranga, Te Wera and Karekare Formations. It is overlain unconformably by the Maastrichtian - ?Landenian WHAREKOPAE GROUP (new name), consisting of the Tahora (revived name) and Rakauroa Formations. The low angle unconformity between the Matawai and Wharekopae Groups is believed to represent only a minor phase of deformation and renewed marine transgression. It is local, not regional, and does not mark a significant time gap. A further unconformity separates Koranga Formation shallow marine coarse clastic sediments from texturally more mature sediments of the overlying Te Wera and Karekare Formations. It too is interpreted as being of only minor significance; it marks only a short period of non-deposition and not a major change in sedimentation pattern. Six biostratigraphic zones, all based on short-ranging species of either Inoceramus or Aucellina have been mapped in Matawai Group strata. Diverse shallow water faunas of the Koranga, Te Wera and lower Karekare Formations are succeeded by upper Karekare assemblages containing few fossils other than Inoceramus. Koranga Formation sandstones are texturally and compositionally immature. Like thick-bedded Urewera sandstones, they are of very mixed provenance, being derived from acid plutonic - high grade metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic sources. Thus although the oldest Matawai Group strata are stratigraphically discrete from the Urewera Greywacke, they were derived largely from similar sources. Petrographic study of sandstones and X-ray study of siltstones suggest Karekare Formation sediments were derived largely from underlying Urewera and Matawai strata. Reworking of unlithified Matawai Group sediments provided much of the detritus for the glauconitic quartzose Tahora sandstone and the siliceous Rakauroa siltstones and shales. Distribution and composition of clays and feldspars in Matawai and Wharekopae rocks indicate a proportion of the sediment was derived from a granitic source to the south or southeast. Although zeolites and authigenic epidote are common in Urewera rocks at Matawai, extensive zeolitisation is virtually restricted to the sandstones and conglomerates overlying the Urewera Greywacke - Matawai Group unconformity. Development of zeolites is not, therefore, wholly a function of depth of burial. Volcanogenic Urewera and Koranga sandstones are both suitable hosts for zeolite formation, and restriction of extensive zeolitisation to the latter indicates the importance of permeability in controlling zeolite distribution. The relatively permeable Koranga Formation was a paleoaquifer because of its stratigraphic position between relatively impermeable Urewera and Karekare strata. From consideration of regional facies patterns, Wharekopae strata at Matawai and their coal measure and marginal marine equivalents in the South Island are believed to be the compositionally mature end products of a sedimentation cycle initiated in Aptian (Korangan) time. Matawai Group strata are considered to post-data the major deformation pulse known as the Rangitata Orogeny. Study of published and unpublished work on coeval rocks elsewhere in New Zealand suggest a fundamental and regional break between Aptian, Albian or even younger sediments, and older rocks. The Matawai Group and its coeval equivalents should, therefore, be included in the Kaikoura Sequence, and not, as has been proposed, in the underlying Rangitata Sequence.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GABAA receptors in the basal ganglia of the rat, baboon and the human brain</field><field name="creator">Waldvogel, Henry J.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic analysis and design of post-tensioned concrete masonry walls</field><field name="creator">Laursen, Peter (Peter Thorup)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the seismic analysis and design of post-tensioning concrete masonry (PCM) walls. Using unbonded post-tensioning, walls are vertically prestressed by means of strands or bars which are passed through vertical ducts inside the walls. As the walls are subjected to lateral displacements (in-plane loading), gaps form at the horizontal joints, reducing the system stiffness. As long as the prestressing strands are kept within the elastic limit, or at least maintain a considerable amount of the initial prestressing force, they can provide a restoring force, which will return the walls to their original alignment upon unloading. The key feature in this behaviour is attributable to the tendons being unbonded over the entire wall height, allowing for distribution of tendon strain over the entire length of the tendon. An extensive literature review found that post-tensioning of masonry has had limited application in seismic areas and that there currently are no specific code requirements for it&#8217;s use for ductile seismic design, largely as a consequence of little knowledge about the ductility capacity and energy dissipation characteristics. It was concluded that structural testing of PCM walls and concrete masonry creep and shrinkage testing were essential to advance the understanding of this construction type. Creep and shrinkage experiments confirmed that long term prestress losses are considerable in both grouted and ungrouted concrete masonry, and must be taken into account in design. It was concluded that it is essential to use high strength steel for prestressing of PCM in order to reduce long term losses. Structural testing confirmed that fully grouted unbonded post-tensioned concrete masonry is a competent material combination for ductile structural wall systems. In particular, PCM walls strengthened in the flexural compression zones with confining plates are expected to successfully withstand severe ground shaking from an earthquake. It was suggested that partially and ungrouted PCM walls may suitably be used in strength design (non-ductile). The proposed prediction method for wall in-plane behaviour was validated by experimental results. Good correlation between predictions and results was found. Displacement spectra were developed for ductile seismic design of PCM walls. These can be used to accurately estimate the displacement demand imposed on multi-storey PCM cantilever walls.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network event detection with entropy measures</field><field name="creator">Eimann, Raimund E.

Network streams are an example for such discrete information sources. This thesis investigates the use of information measures for the detection of events in network streams. Starting with the fundamental entropy and complexity measures proposed by Shannon and Kolmogorov, it reviews a range of candidate information measures for network event detection, including algorithms from the Lempel-Ziv family and a relative newcomer, the T-entropy. Using network trace data from the University of Auckland, the thesis demonstrates experimentally that these measures are in principle suitable for the detection of a wide range of network events. Several key parameters influence the detectability of network events with information measures. These include the amount of data considered in each traffic sample and the choice of observables. Among others, a study of the entropy behaviour of individual observables in event and non-event scenarios investigates the optimisation of these parameters. The thesis also examines the impact of some of the detected events on different information measures. This motivates a discussion on the sensitivity of various measures. A set of experiments demonstrating multi-dimensional network event classification with multiple observables and multiple information measures concludes the thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Theory</field><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">Network Events</field><field name="subject">Anomaly Detection</field><field name="subject">Network Event Detection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure, metamorphism and mineral deposits in the Diahot region, northern New Caledonia</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Roger M.</field><field name="description">The area studied, covers about 150 square kilometers in the northern end of New Caledonia in the lower parts of the Diahot River near Ou&#233;goa. The rocks consist dominantly of a metamorphosed Cretaceous sedimentary-igneous sequence of carbonaceous pelites with intercalated basaltic rocks and rhyolitic tuffs. The Cretaceous sequence is flanked to the southwest by Eocene rocks consisting mainly of siliceous argillites, phtanites (massive cherts) and limestones. High-pressure metamorphism, radiometrically dated at 38-21 m.y. (Oligocene-lowermost Miocene) by Coleman (1967), increases progressively in grade towards the northeast in a continuous sequence from lawsonite-albite facies through glaucophanitic greenschists to eclogitic glaucophanitic albite-epidote amphibolites. Lowest, grade rocks occur in the southwest near the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and the highest grade rocks are exposed along the east coast and as tectonically-emplaced blocks in fault zones around Ou&#233;goa. Regional metamorphic assemblages are defined with respect, to four zones in pelitic parents which in order of increasing metamorphic grade are:- (1) lowest grade rocks, (2) lawsonite zone, (3) transitional zone, (4) epidote zone. Metamorphic isograds are mapped for paraschist lawsonite, Na-amphibole, garnet and epidote; and for pumpellyite, Na-amphibole, lawsonite and omphacite in metabasalts. In the Cretaceous rocks the regional strike of the foliation is northwest-southeast with dips to the southwest, although small-scale steeply-plunging folds are abundant. On a regional scale the major structure is an open to isoclinal, asymmetric, reclined fold with a sinistral vergence, trending southwest, and it plunges steeply down the dip of the regional foliation. This folding occurred largely synchronously with high-pressure metamorphism. During retrogressive metamorphism, large-scale trans-current sinistral faulting occurred, striking northwest-southeast and dipping southwest. In the region north and east of Ou&#233;goa these faults characteristically occur as zones up to 2 km wide occupied by high-grade ortho- and paragneisses (glaucophanites) and serpentinites, and form a complex anastomosing network. This faulting, accompanied by broad flexuring, has removed some parts of the metamorphic sequence resulting in constrictions and broad, flexuring of the isograd patterns in certain areas of the field. Small-scale kink and chevron folding has occurred late in the tectonic history and post-date both the steeply-plunging folds and the metamorphism. Stratiform Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization with minor amounts of Au and Ag occur at five relatively major sites (Pilou, M&#233;r&#233;trice, Fern-Hill, Balade and Murat mines) and at numerous smaller localities throughout the field. The mineralization is restricted to definite stratigraphic horizons in the Cretaceous sequence where black carbonaceous phyllites are associated and interbedded with rhyolitic metatuffs. The sulphide ores are well laminated, show relict sedimentary textures, and occur as layers and lenses which are conformable with the host rocks. The deposits are thought to be sedimentary-volcanic in origin and derived from acid volcanic metalliferous exhalations which have undergone chemical precipitation and sedimentation in localized, black shale, euxinic environments on the sea floor. All of the deposits have been subjected to and variously modified by the metamorphism. An attempt is made to explain the large-scare structural features observed in the Diahot region in terms of plate tectonic theory.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the life cycles of two species of forcipulate starfish (Echinodermata, Asteroidea) from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barker, Michael Francis</field><field name="description">Annual reproductive cycles and the related changes in the pyloric caeca of the New Zealand starfish Stichaster australis and Coscinasterias calamaria (Echinodermata, Asteroidea) were determined at Maori Bay on the west coast of Auckland. Both species were shown to have clearly defined reproductive and pyloric caeca cycles, closely repeated from year to year. Pyloric caeca cycles showed an approximate although slightly displaced inverse relationship to gonad cycles. Changes in the gonad shown by histological sections confirmed these cycles. In addition to sexual reproduction C. calamaria may reproduce asexually by autotomy. Frequency of asexual reproduction did not vary seasonally and may be related to physiological stress or mechanical damage. Oocytes of S. australis and C. calamaria were fertilized in the laboratory and the resulting larvae reared through to metamorphosed starfish. The methods used in larval culture and embryological and larval development are described. Larvae of S. australis and C. calamaria closely resemble the larvae of Asterias rubens, described by Gemmill (1914), and of other planktotrophic asteroid larvae. Abnormal larvae found in some cultures are thought to result from, unsuitable culture conditions. It was found that oocytes of both species could be cross fertilized with sperm of the other. The settling behaviour was described and substrate preferences of advanced brachiolaria larvae of S. australis and C. calamaria were determined with larvae reared in the laboratory. These results were correlated with field observations of habitat preferences of juvenile starfish. C. calamaria larvae settled on almost any hard substratum provided it was coated with a primary film. Recently metamorphosed C. calamaria could not be located at Maori Bay and it is inferred that there is low recruitment from the plankton to the Maori Bay population. S. australis larvae would only settle, metamorphose and feed on the encrusting coralline alga Mesophyllum insigne. Nursery areas of offshore boulders covered with this alga were located at Maori Bay and these were found to support populations of juvenile starfish. Mesophyllum insigne appears to provide a stable and abundant food source for juvenile S. australis. The structure of the brachiolar arms and adhesive disc of S. australis and C. calamaria was determined from light microscopy and from scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The structure of these organs was very similar in S. australis and C. calamaria. The brachiolar arms are comprised of a stem region terminating in a crown of adhesive papillae. Adhesive papillae are made up of a variety of secretory cell types. Principal among these are elongated cells producing very electron dense secretory particles. These are released at the free cell surface attached to cilia. secretory particles appear to be important in temporary attachment of the brachiolar arms to the substratum. Ciliary sense cells, possibly used in the recognition of specific substrates are located at the tip of adhesive papillae. The adhesive disc is comprised of large cells packed with secretory droplets and elongated intracellular fibres. In the attached adhesive disc secretory droplets have been lost, having formed the cement attaching the disc to the substratum. The intracellular fibres are the principal anchoring structures running from the disc surface microvilli (locked into the attachment cement) to the underlying connective tissue of the attachment stalk. S. australis juveniles reared in the laboratory were maintained on Mesophyllum insigne substrata and the growth rates and feeding behaviour of individual starfish was determined. Growth of yearly settlement cohorts on a nursery site on the shore used in conjunction with laboratory results gave a fairly clear picture of growth after settlement. Growth rates followed a typical logistic curve, growth being slow initially and becoming more rapid later. The numbers of juveniles recruited to nursery areas vary from year to year but mortality following settlement appears to be low. It was found that juvenile S. australis predate M. insigne exclusively until they reach approximately 0.8cm in diameter (7-8 months old) when they may occasionally predate juvenile perna canaliculus. The incidence of carnivorous feeding gradually increases until juveniles are approximately 2.0-2.5cm in diameter (15-18 months old) by which time they are exclusively carnivorous on small P. canaliculus. As growth continues juvenile starfish gradually migrate from nursery areas to adjacent reefs where dense beds of adult P. canaliculus occur. Starfish of this species become sexually mature when they reach approximately 8.0cm in diameter. Juvenile C. calamaria reared in the laboratory feed on the primary film coating the substratum. Field observations at Leigh showed juveniles of 0.8-0.9cm diameter to be feeding on small barnacles on the undersides of boulders. Juveniles could not be reared to this size in the laboratory and the point at which juveniles change from a herbivorous or microphagous to a carnivorous diet is still unknown. Because of frequent autotomy it was not possible to determine growth rates of C. calamaria in the laboratory. Starfish of this species become sexually mature they reach 5.0-10.0cm in diameter.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and stereochemistry of the diterpenes and the glycoalkaloid from solanum nigrum</field><field name="creator">Davis, Brian Reeve</field><field name="description">The diterpenoids are fairly widely distributed in nature.

Both main and changeover key performances were examined as a function of the relative reinforcement rates and of the changeover schedule duration. Main key performances changed quantitatively, but not qualitatively, as the temporal separation of components increased, with performance becoming less sensitive to relative reinforcement rates with increasing temporal separation. In general, absolute response rates were adequately predicated by the relative reinforcement rates, but in some conditions the absolute response rate was also affected by the availability of the responses. The rates of responding to change between components were controlled by the reinforcement rates in the both of the concurrent schedule components, and, in some conditions, varied independently of main key response rates. The rates of responding to alternate between components were a direct function of the reinforcement rate in the absent component, and were an inverse function of the reinforcement rate for main key responding in the same component. Animals alternated between the concurrent schedule components even when alternation reduced the overall rate of obtained reinforcement.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daz sint noch ungelogeniu wort: a literary and linguistic commentary on the Gurnemanz episode in Book iii of Wolfram&#8217;s Parzival (161,9-179,12)</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Simon Julian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of stability and change orientations in organisational culture: a case study</field><field name="creator">Burchell, Richard Noel</field><field name="description">There is a fundamental need of all organisations to exhibit both stability and change behaviours in order to survive in the long term, particularly when operating in competitive environments. This duality may seem paradoxical and contradictory, but these interactions are necessary for sustainable organisational continuity. Stability and change should be considered in concert rather than focussing on change at the expense of stability. It is proposed that cultural manifestations can develop over time that directly or indirectly reflect organisational concerns with stability and change, and can be investigated as two key cultural dimensions. The aim of this study was to discover how and why organisational members associated their culture with the dimensions of stability and change. Interpretations of these associations provide support for the two dimensions being viewed as separate, but also being complementary and interdependent in nature. This differs from previous perspectives in the literature that portray the dimensions as being on a single dimension. This in-depth study was conducted in a single New Zealand business organisation. It shows how cultural orientations towards stability and change can be discerned as patterns. Associations by organisational members of cultural manifestations with the dimensions of stability and change was explored utilising a triangulation research design incorporating Concept Mapping and Pattern Matching, semi-structured interviews and observations as research methods. Pattern Matching is a technique that has not been previously employed in cultural research and the findings suggest the technique can be a useful tool in cultural analysis. The study showed that members found culture, and in particular its associations with stability and change, a somewhat challenging concept to articulate. This study also supports the need for the dimensions of stability and change to be viewed as being dynamic and interconnected. Nonetheless, a proposed typology was developed based on the premise that these dimensions are conceptually separate. It shows promise for better understanding the influence of culture on patterns of stability and change within organisations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhythms, feeding and respiration of the oyster Crassostrea gigas</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Elizabeth Elsa</field><field name="description">Endogeneity of valve movement rhythms was demonstrated for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas under constant conditions of temperature, light, salinity, water level and food availability. Rhythms continued for up to 6 weeks until the experiments were terminated. The rhythms showed a high degree of temperature compensation between 13 - 24&#730;C, but at 4&#730;C the free-running period was abnormally long. The length of the &#8220;open", or active phase decreased with temperature. Oysters collected from subtidal sites, as opposed to intertidal sites, also exhibited endogenous rhythms when held under constant condition. Oysters that received no food during a starvation trial were also rhythmic. Oysters subjected to artificial tidal cycles (HL 6:6h), show very precise synchronization of valve opening and closing to the cycles. Oysters were also be entrained to water disturbance cycles (6:6h) and light cycles (LD 12:12h), but the synchronization was not as precise. Rhythms were characterized by (1) split rhythms (2) spontaneous changes in the free-running period (3) spontaneous changes in rhythm clarity (4) spontaneous phase changes (5) and a Lot of "noise". These characteristics suggest that the underlying pacemaker controlling the rhythm may consist of more than one oscillator or more than one group of oscillators. No conclusive evidence could be found for semilunar or lunar rhythmicity. Cycles in the rate of algal cell clearance over a 24h period were shown by individual oysters. As a consequence of the variability between individuals combining the data tended to hide the existence of the rhythms. No evidence for rhythms in assimilation efficiency was found. Cell clearance rates were also affected by rising temperature over the range 4 - 25&#730;C, reaching a peak value at 17&#730;C. The rate of cell clearance fell sharply after 60 - 90min of feeding in a closed system, indicating that the rate was significantly affected by the decline in food availability. The time taken to open the valves and to start faeces production fell with increasing temperature. The amount of faeces production followed a similar trend. Assimilation efficiency fell with increasing temperature and many negative values were evident, suggesting contamination. However the total weight of faeces produced was less than that of food available implying that the oysters were assimilating inorganic material. The time taken to open the valves and the % oysters that opened their valves was adversely affected by declining salinity over the range 8.5 - 34&#8240;. The time taken to start faeces production and. the % of oysters that produced faeces followed a similar trend. Assimilation efficiency was not significantly different at 25.5 and 34&#8240;. AE% could not be measured at 8.5 and 17&#8240; due to a lack of normal faeces. Individual oysters showed cycles in the rate of oxygen uptake, but these were not synchronized to the tides or to each other. Pooling the data to calculate means cancelled out the individual rhythmicities. The presence or absence of food did not affect the expression of the cycle. The rate of oxygen uptake was positively correlated to oyster dry weight, temperature and salinity. Though for salinity the rate of oxygen uptake fell sharply below a critical salinity occurring between 10 - 13&#8240;. Oysters held in sealed respirometers maintained a constant rate of oxygen uptake until a critical level of oxygen availability was reached, the rate of oxygen uptake dropped .significantly below this level. The slope of the regression lines (&#730;b&#730;), prior to reaching the critical oxygen level, increased with temperature, salinity and food concentration. But the time taken to reach the critical oxygen level, and the level of oxygen availability at which this occurred, was not significantly correlated with temperature, salinity or food concentration. The pattern of valve movement corresponded to the level of oxygen available. Valve movements became very frequent as the critical oxygen level was approached. Activity was reduced to occasional periods of valve movement after it was reached. The level of activity was adversely affected by declining salinity, but was not affected by the level of food availability.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rarotongan society: the creation of tradition</field><field name="creator">Baddeley, Josephine Gail</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The crystal structure of acetamidoxime</field><field name="creator">Claridge, G.

The sequence consists of an airfall deposit overlain in places by up to four ignimbrites erupted from the Okataina Volcanic Centre. The airfall consists, at its base, of crystal poor (&lt; 7%) pumice with a phenocryst assemblage of plagioclase, quartz, hypersthene, magnetite and ilmenite with rare zircon and apatite. Towards the top of the airfall unit crystal rich (&gt; 7%) pumice is present along with crystal poor pumice and thus forms a bimodal population. The crystal rich pumice has the same mineralogy as the crystal poor pumice plus hornblende. The pumice ranges from rhyolite to high-silica rhyolite with the rhyolite containing high TiO2, MgO, CaO, Zr and Sr and low K2O, Ba and Rb in comparison to the high silica rhyolite. The mixture of high silica rhyolite and rhyolite pumice is present throughout the remainder of the eruption with more high silica rhyolite than rhyolite erupted and with no significant change in proportions. The variation in chemistry and mineralogy indicates that the magma was compositionally zoned. Random and oscillatory zoning with evidence of resorption episodes in plagioclase and hypersthene suggest that the magma was turbulently convecting. Zoning in the magma was therefore probably characterised by fluid interfaces between fluid dynamically distinct layers. Stability relations of hornblende and pressure estimates suggest that the hornblende containing rhyolite lay above the high silica rhyolite. The variation is interpreted as having formed by rapid crystallisation and absorption of water on the margins of the intrusion. Least square calculations indicate that fractional crystallisation is a viable mechanism although diffusion through the fluid interface(s) must have occurred with redistribution of components by convection in each layer. The vent of the Matahina eruption tapped the side of the magma chamber close to the interface between the rhyolite and high silica rhyolite. Turbulence during the eruption lead to limited mixing of the zoned magma with the formation of pumice with overlapping mineral composition ranges and rare banded pumice. Indicators such as a lack of an associated veneer deposit, the multi-flow nature of the eruption sequence and strong welding suggest that the eruption was of moderate violence (for its type). Modelling of welding suggests depositional temperatures of between 650 and 700&#176;C in the Rangitaiki Valley. The presence of unexsolved titanomagnetites and osumilite support such high depositional temperatures. Almandine garnet of vapour phase origin indicates that little air was incorporated into the eruption column. Devitrification was characterised by the formation of axiolitic and spherulitic intergrowths of cristobalite and alkali feldspar. SEM observations suggest that the density of nucleating points determines the textures in the devitrifying ignimbrite. Degassing of the ignimbrite was characterised by corrosion of glass and subsequent deposition of minerals such as tridymite and alkali feldspar. Si and Zr were the least mobile elements. The Matahina eruption sequence is an example of a zoned pluton erupted early in its evolution.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of urban form: a descriptive technique and investigation of the form of a New Zealand urban environment</field><field name="creator">Civil, Denise</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates factors which influence the physical form of the urban environment at the micro-scale. Three aspects of form are considered. These are configuration, separation, and consistency. A method of assessing the form of a property from a public place with respect to these aspects is outlined. The technique breaks each aspect into a scale of form types as a tool for measuring the formal characteristics of the environment. These form types are used to describe an urban environment. A comparison of this description with the physical attributes of the area identifies four factors which may have affected the patterns and distributions of the forms observed in the description. These are land use, land ownership patterns, time, and regulatory controls. Detailed studies of these factors in five particular areas reveals that relationships between each of the factors and the incidence of the various form types exist. Correspondences which suggest that the factor probably has an influence on the forms identified are evident in varying degrees depending on the factor considered.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310103 Urban and regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sin-complex: a critical study of English versions of the Grimms&#8217; Kinder- und Hausm&#228;rchen in the nineteenth century in comparison with the German originals</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Martin James</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the English versions of the Grimms&#8217; Kinder- und Hausm&#228;rchen (= KHM) published between the years 1823 and 1884, i.e. from the first translation by Edgar Taylor and David Jardine, German Popular Stories (1823 and 1826), to the first complete edition of the Grimms&#8217; collection of stories and notes by Margaret Hunt, Grimm&#8217;s Household Tales (1884). Each of the first eleven chapters deals with a specific English edition and gives an analysis of one or more stories from that edition together with the texts of the German original. The two versions, German and English, are placed alongside each other in parallel columns to facilitate comparison. The twelfth chapter takes the final paragraph of one story, &#8216;Sneewittchen&#8217; (KHM 53), and examines the seven different English versions of it in the editions discussed in the previous chapters. The final chapter compares the quality of English translations of the KHM in the nineteenth century with that of the Grimms&#8217; sole venture in translating tales in the English language into German, viz. Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s Irische Elfenm&#228;rchen (1826). Included as an appendix is a tabulated concordance of the contents of the twelve major editions discussed in this thesis. The investigation shows that the areas deemed to be sensitive ones by English translators were those which had to do with what Darton (Children&#8217;s Books in England, 1982, p.99) has singled out as &#8216;a deep-rooted sin-complex&#8217; in England. Any story that touched on the issues of religious belief and superstition, the human body and its physical nature, violence and evil, and the intense emotions felt by human beings which prompt them to commit violent and destructive acts, was inevitably viewed with concern and mistrust, especially by purveyors of children&#8217;s literature in the nineteenth century. All these issues, as well as the element of fantasy which so readily admits and entertains them, were prone to considerable revision by successive translators of the KHM.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists in patients with heart failure</field><field name="creator">Doughty, Robert N.</field><field name="description">Background Congestive heart failure is a common clinical syndrome, the incidence and prevalence of which appear to be increasing. Mortality and morbidity remain high despite major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology and management of heart failure over recent years. Consequently there is a need for further therapies which can improve the outlook for patients with heart failure. The beta-blockers have traditionally been contraindicated in patients with heart failure. However, there is a strong rationale for using these agents in addition to the ACE inhibitors. The aims of this thesis were several fold. Firstly, to determine the magnitude of the problem which heart failure represents in New Zealand. Secondly, to determine the effects of beta-blockers, on LV size and function, symptoms, and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Finally, to conduct a systematic overview to determine the effects of beta-blockers on total mortality in patients with heart failure. Methods Data were obtained from the New Zealand Health Information Service regarding hospitalisations and deaths due to heart failure in New Zealand. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of carvedilol, a vasodilator beta-blocker, was carried out in 20 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. In this study patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease were randomised to either carvedilol or placebo in addition to their usual treatment. An echocardiographic substudy was carried out in 10 of the 20 centres. The aims of this substudy were to determine the effects of carvedilol on left ventricular size and function, using quantitative 2D-echocardiography. Finally, the effects of beta-blockers on total mortality was examined in a systematic overview. Results The data regarding heart failure in New Zealand showed that each year there were an average of 8000 hospital admissions each year of 5000 patients with heart failure. In addition, there were at least 850 deaths each year directly related to heart failure. The cost associated with the hospital admissions was estimated at NZ$50 million per year, or 1% of the total health budget in New Zealand. The ANZ carvedilol study demonstrated firstly, that carvedilol is well tolerated in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved compared with placebo treated patients and left ventricular size was reduced when assessed by M-mode echocardiography. Despite these improvements in left ventricular function, symptoms and exercise tolerance were unchanged. However, there was a reduction in a combined end-point of death or hospital readmission in the carvedilol group compared with placebo. The 2D-echocardigraphy substudy demonstrated that carvedilol reduced both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and prevented the progressive LV dilatation which occurred in the placebo group. These changes occurred with the improvement in LV ejection fraction which had previously been reported. In addition to these favourable effects on LV size and function, left ventricular regional wall motion was improved. The overview of 24 randomised trials involving 3141 patients showed that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality by 31% compared with control. Conclusions Firstly, the NZ data has confirmed that heart failure remains a major public health problem in New Zealand. The ANZ Carvedilol Trial has shown the carvedilol is safe and well tolerated in patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Carvedilol improved left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced left ventricular volumes and improved left ventricular regional wall motion. In addition, carvedilol reduced death or hospital readmission but had little effect on symptoms or exercise tolerance. The results from the meta-analysis have shown that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality by approximately one-third. Such data support the use of beta-blockers in addition to ACE inhibitors in the treatment of patients with heart failure. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to reliably determine the effects of beta-blockers in different patient subgroups, such as the elderly and those with more severe heart failure, as well as the effects on total mortality before such therapy can be recommended for widespread use in all patients with heart failure.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological studies of leg ulcers in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Natalie K.</field><field name="description">A leg ulcer is generally considered to be any break in the skin on the lower leg (below the knee) or on the foot, which has been present for more than six weeks. Typically the condition is a consequence of disease of the circulatory system, and can cause considerable disability. The Auckland leg ulcer study is a community-based study of leg ulceration conducted in the North Auckland and Central Auckland health districts of New Zealand. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of leg ulcers in the community and investigate several possible risk factors for the condition. Cases were identified through notifications from health professionals and by self-notification. Cases aged between 40 and 99 years and on the electoral roll for the study region were invited to participate in a case-control study. Controls were individuals without leg ulcers and were selected from the electoral roll using a stratified random sampling process. Controls were also aged between 40 and 99 years and had to be resident within the study region to be eligible. Four hundred and twenty-six cases with current leg ulcers were identified during the 12-month study period, with 241 cases and 224 controls interviewed for the case-control study. Overall, the occurrence of leg ulcers in the general population was low, however, the prevalence and cumulative incidence increased dramatically with age, and changed according to gender and region. The average age at ulcer onset in interviewed cases was 65 years. Leg ulcers took approximately 12 months on average to heal, and recurrence occurred in 59% of cases. Treatment strategies were variable, and almost a quarter of all cases had been admitted to hospital within the last five years because of their ulcers. The average length of hospital stay was 34 days. Results from the case-control study indicated that deep vein thrombosis, lower limb surgery, leg fracture, and varicose veins were strong risk factors for the development of leg ulcers, Furthermore, nulligravida increased the risk of ulcer development while prolonged breast-feeding decreased risk, suggesting a hormonal component to the development of leg ulcers in women. These data have important implications for the prevention of this chronic condition.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mechanism of the anti-tumour action of flavone acetic acid and its xanthenone acetic acid analogues</field><field name="creator">Zwi, Leon Jonathan</field><field name="description">The search for new compounds with anti-tumour activity is driven by the high mortality from disseminated visceral carcinomas for which few effective treatments exist. The experimental agent flavone acetic acid (FAA) has stimulated interest because of its broad spectrum of activity against solid tumours in mice. This remarkable activity spectrum suggested an unusual mechanism of action. The aim of the thesis was to elucidate the mechanism of action of FAA and its analogues in mouse tumours, particularly the rapid induction of haemorrhagic necrosis Light and electron microscopic studies of Colon 38 tumours treated with 1.2 mmo1/kg FAA revealed a sequence of tumour cell separation and rounding focal apoptosis and finally confluent necrosis with blood vessel engorgement and rupture within 4 - 8 h. This was accompanied by a loss of energy metabolites. The combination of apoptotic and necrotic modes of cell death suggested that both ischaemic and non-ischaemic mechanisms were involved. The role of blood flow failure was further investigated in Colon 38 and EMT6 tumours using a double label fluorescent vessel-labelling technique, which demonstrated a progressive and sustained fall in blood flow, beginning within 15 min of treatment. A mathematical model of ischaemic tumour cell killing using data from measurements of tumour perfusion, the rate of FAA-induced cell killing and the rate of cell death following global ischaemia indicated that mechanisms in addition ischaemia were involved. However, comparison of the resistance to FAA of avascular intraperitoneal tumour multicellular spheroids and vascularised tumours suggested that the major component of the anti-tumour effect was indeed blood vessel-dependent. The vessel-independent effects of FAA were then studied in vitro, using EMT6 tumour multicellular spheroids which had been placed for six days in the peritoneal cavities of mice to become infiltrated by macrophages and lymphocytes. These ex vivo spheroids were more that twice as sensitive as spheroids grown entirely in vitro, when exposed to 2.5 mM FAA for 24 h. This provides evidence for immune cell mediation of the FAA anti-tumour effect. To determine the relative importance of the vessel dependent and the immune mediated effects of FAA, a novel vascularised spheroid tumour system, which contained both avascular and vascular component was developed and studied. FAA treatment caused necrosis only in the vascularised component preceded by a loss in perfusion. The avascular tumour tissue also showed evidence of some cell loss by apoptosis. Thus, in tumour tissue not relying directly on blood vessels for metabolite exchange only limited cell killing occurs suggesting that treatment with FAA-like agents alone would have limited ability to cure. The anti-tumour activities of a series of xanthenone acetic acid (XAA) analogues of FAA, were then compared with FAA by examination and measurement of morphological changes in subcutaneous tumours and spheroids, and by measurement of blood perfusion In tumours. Those XAA analogues which were active in inducing haemorrhagic necrosis also caused FAA-like morphological changes in tumours and spheroids and inhibited blood flow, indicating a similar mode of action to FAA. The parent XAA and FAA were approximately equipotent, and 5-methyl XAA and 5,6-dimethyl XAA were about ten times as potent as FAA. 3-O-methyl XAA, 8-methyl XAA and xanthenone-4,5-diacetic acid showed no FAA-like activities. Examination of non-tumour tissues after therapeutic doses of FAA and 5,6-dimethyl XAA showed cytolytic lesions Including necrosis In the peripheral lymphoid tissues, the thymus and the uterus. Thus, although these agents lack the myelosuppressive effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents cell killing is not entirely specific for tumours. The sensitive tissues, including tumours, have in common a high content of macrophages or neutrophils, and regions of low vascular density. The thesis studies have shown that FAA and its analogues differ from conventional cytotoxic (anti-proliferative) agents in their mechanism of action. Direct toxicity against tumour cells is of minor importance compared to macrophage mediated cytotoxicity and perfusion failure. If biological activity can be demonstrated in humans FAA-like agents may show clinical utility in combination with radiotherapy, conventional or hypoxia selective cytotoxic agents.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Status epilepticus: mechanisms of generation and associated neuropathology</field><field name="creator">Young, Deborah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chronotope as a model for hypermedia in architectural education</field><field name="creator">Soutar, Anna L., 1942-</field><field name="description">The thesis is a retrospective reporting and a critical examination of HyperSteel.

"The thesis", part 1 of the thesis, is a theoretical statement comprising, in Chapter I, an explicit statement of the theoretical framework in the form of five premises derived from philosophy and theories of psychology, art and architecture, and sociology. And, in Chapter II, a statement of the two hypotheses (that dwelling environments are perceived as "meaning" the people who live in them and that people choose dwelling environments, other things being equal, according to their concept of the kind of people they are) and the assumptions necessary to test them. In Part 2: "The Research Method" Chapter III covers the development of the measure of closure in dwelling environments. Closure was chosen in Chapter II as the environmental variable to be used for the purposes of this study. The final measure comprises five sets of four bird&#8217;s eye view perspective line drawings depicting five situations in a typical house in which closure is varied in four steps from very open to very closed. Chapter IV describes the development of the measure of household identity. The measure of household identity was developed especially to be of relevance to the choice of degrees of closure in dwelling environments. The measure is derived from actual verbal responses of the respondents to open ended questions asked in pilot studies. In Chapter V, the last chapter in Part 2, the research design of the survey study is described: the research model used, the design of the questionnaire, and the sampling method. The first chapter of Part 3: "The Results and Discussion of the Results", Chapter VI, presents the sample size (610) and shows that the sample is representative of the population of the Auckland greater urban area. In Chapter VII, the results relating to hypothesis I are presented and discussed. The results weakly support the hypothesis but the correlations are not of sufficient strength to be used predictively. In Chapter VIII the results of hypothesis 2 are presented and discussed. These results also support the hypothesis but even less strongly so than for hypothesis 1. Chapter VIII also covers sub-hypothesis 1, that people choose dwelling environments according to their "objective&#8221; household identity, In Chapter IX the results of the hypotheses are compared and summarized. And in Chapter X the implications of the results are outlined: an attempt is made to relative the results to the theoretical framework and from this implications for a possible theory of aesthetics are drawn. The implications of the results for the theory and practice of architecture are delineated and finally suggestions for future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The complaints and disciplinary process in New Zealand and the effect of complaints on doctors</field><field name="creator">Cunningham, Wayne Kenneth</field><field name="description">New Zealand society assumes that the medical complaints process enhances the delivery of medical care, although the literature suggests that complaints may impact negatively on doctors, and their ability to practice. This thesis examines the impact of the complaints process on doctors in New Zealand. It considers the practice of medicine from the viewpoints of the epistemology of medicine; the doctor-patient relationship; and the notion of professionalism. It presents the results of research methods investigating New Zealand doctors using focus groups; a cross sectional questionnaire based survey; and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Findings include: One in three doctors has received a complaint. The annual rate of complaint is 5.70%, 15% of complaints are upheld. Complaints impact negatively on the person of the doctor, the doctor-patient relationship, and doctors&#8217; ability to practice. The purposes of a complaints system include: the maintenance of trust and professional standards; being a voice for patients; and learning from mistakes and errors. Doctors&#8217; attitudes are consistent with notions of professionalism. Defensive medicine is an adverse outcome of the complaints process. Doctors suggest a Complaints Tribunal as a single point of entry into the complaints process. The current complaints process is not improving the delivery of medical care to New Zealand society. New Zealand doctors are aware of both the biomedical and bio-psychosocial paradigms underlying modern medicine, and the results confirm the importance of the self of the doctor and the doctor-patient relationship in medical practice. The emergence of defensive medicine indicates that doctors may respond to complaints by practicing in a way that is not in their patients&#8217; best interests, but which serves to protect doctors themselves. Defensive medicine risks being unrecognised and becoming normalised into mainstream medical practice. The negative impact of complaints on doctors&#8217; values and beliefs indicate an erosion of values based professionalism. This thesis suggests that an appropriate model for considering medical professionalism is as a state of relationship between doctors and society. Appropriate change to the complaints process may enhance the doctor-society relationship and ultimately enhance the delivery of medical care in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The morality of planning: an exploration</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Gael, 1959-</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the contention that planning is a moral activity concerned with the way in which people live in relation to nature or the environment. It suggests that planning is the moral framework by which communities and individuals confront their relationship with nature or the environment. It argues that certain disciplines such as town planning, resource management, environmental ethics, aspects of theology and of art are but isolated and narrowed aspects of a wider activity of planning. The rationale for embarking on such a discussion of planning relies in part on the observation that when modern planners take a more contemplative approach to their craft, they have often been perplexed about their frequent failure to deliver the good they assumed that planning set out to achieve. It is suggested that this intent to achieve good is inherent to planning and that it is a moral concern. Planning, under this analysis, is part of the wider realm of moral philosophy and decision-making - that is undertaken by all people. Planning extends beyond mere moral discourse to encompass a number of mechanisms that bind individuals and communities to the moral norms they have adopted. These mechanisms, one of which is the key institution of property rights, are also affected by ideas that change over time; they exist in a dynamic interrelationship with both planning discourse (debates about moral structures and norms) and planning codes (norms adopted by individuals and communities as standards for action). This thesis takes this broad interpretation of planning and considers it in relation to four periods in planning history. In doing so, a number of themes are identified in relation to the role of planners, the decision-making structures of planning and the nature of planning discourse. These themes are considered in relation to the way Maori planning systems have developed in New Zealand since European settlement. They are also considered in terms of whether it is possible to identify certain universal moral rules within planning and whether there are certain tasks that all planners must address.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal evolution and fluid-rock interactions in the Orakeikorako- Te Kopia geothermal system, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bignall, Gregory, 1963-</field><field name="description">The active Orakeikorako-Te Kopia geothermal system was drilled in the mid-1960&#8217;s, down to 1405m, as part of a programme to investigate its electrical generation capability. Four wells were completed at Orakeikorako (23km NNE of Taupo) and two at Te Kopia, 9.5km further northeast. The exploration drilling provided information on the present day hydrological and thermal regime which is as hot as 265&#176;C (1137m drilled depth (-801m RL) in OK-2). Major flows into the wells occurred at depths down to 850m, although poor permeability and decline in mass output discouraged development. The waters discharged were of near neutral pH and had low salinities (highest Cl content from OK-2 &#8776;546mg/kg), low discharge enthalpies and indicated water temperatures (TSiO2 and TNaKCa) of 2l0&#176;C to 240&#176;C. A hydrologic model proposed here envisages a hot water reservoir in the OK-2 area (northeastern part of the Orakeikorako thermal area) with a lateral flow supplying water to the Red Hill (OK-4 area) in the southern part of the system and a concealed northeast flow which reaches the surface at Te Kopia. The Orakeikorako thermal area occupies a surface area of about 1.8km2, mainly on the east bank of the Waikato River, where dilute chloride-bicarbonate water discharges along faults and fractures in association with an extensive silica sinter sheet, boiling springs and geysers. The occurrence of a mordenite-smectite assemblage at shallow depths, plus the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of surface discharge waters, indicate that the ascending chloride fluids are diluted by near surface (heated?) groundwaters. The &#948;D shift from local groundwater composition may be evidence for a magmatic component to the convecting hydrothermal system. Incursion of fluids from the relatively cool (&lt;l20&#176;C) steam-heated carapace into deep levels of the system and its mixing with the alkali-chloride fluids, produces argillic alteration, sealing and will eventually result in the demise of the system. Old silica sinter on the west bank, at the foot of the Tutukau Rhyolite Dome, is covered by Oruanui Ash (22,700 years B.P.) and demonstrates that the hydrologic character of this part of the system has changed due to a combination of fault movement, changes in the height of the watertable and sealing. The Te Kopia thermal area is located along 2.5km of the Paeroa Fault scarp, a major structural feature inferred to be controlling migration of deep hydrothermal fluids in the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia area. Surface activity at Te Kopia is characterised by acid alteration (including fumaroles, warm acid pools and steaming ground), although neutral pH alkali-chloride fluids discharged here within the last 3000 years and deposited silica sinter (C14 age on wood enveloped by sinter is 3026 +/- 43years B.P.). New thermal areas in the past --year have begun to develop in the northwestern part of Te Kopia, whilst cold hydrothermally altered ground (hosting a mordenite + clay assemblage) records a decline in activity in the southern part of the Te Kopia thermal area. The system is hosted by a generally SE dipping sequence of Pliocene to Quaternary ignimbrite, tuff and rhyolite lavas of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Point counting, electron microprobe analyses of surviving primary phases (Fe, Mg, Al and Ti contents of hornblende and biotite), together with X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis were used to distinguish three extensive ignimbrites encountered in the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia drillholes: (0.33Ma, sanidine-bearing) Paeroa, (0.35Ma) Te Kopia and (undated) Akatarewa Ignimbrites, despite their having been hydrothermally altered. Ignimbrite recognition is made on the basis of a combination of immobile trace and rare earth element abundances and ratios: Ta and Yb (ppm), P2O5(%) and the ratios Zr/Yb, Zr/Y, Yb/Hf, La/Lu, Nb/Hf, Zr/Nb, Zr/Lu, Yb/Ta, Ta/Lu, La/Tb and Nb/Ta. The Paeroa Ignimbrite is distinguished by is Eu anomaly ((Eu/Eu*)cn is 0.48 to 0.54), whereas the Te Kopia and Akatarewa Ignimbrites are characterised by their flatter REE Spidergrams ((Eu/Eu*)cn is ~1.0 and ~0.8 respectively). The correlation of the extensive ignimbrites was satisfactorily effected by a combination of their characteristic bulk rock and pumice chemistry, plus primary mineralogy, to enable the subsurface stratigraphy and structure of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia geothermal system to be defined. The alteration assemblage below 500m consists of quartz, albite+adularia, with variable abundence and distribution of chlorite, pyrite, calcite, wairakite, epidote, pyrrhotite, titanite, leucoxene, siderite and clinozoisite; illite is a late overprint. Rare almandine occurs in rhyolite in OK-1: 1312.5m; this is the first known occurrence of garnet in an active geothermal system of the TVZ. The surficial alteration assemblage of kaolin, cristobalite, alunite, hematite and jarosite reflects alteration by acid sulphate-steam heated waters. The occurrence and textual relations exhibited by the hydrothermal mineral assemblage define the geochemical structure and thermal evolution of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system The activities of components of minerals, determined from electron microprobe analyses and composition-activity relationships (OK-2 discharge: log&#945;K+/&#945;H+=3.6, log&#945;Na+/&#945;H+=4.8) support the petrologic observation that illite is now the stable potassium phase (overprinting adularia), although a state of equilibrium between the sheet silicate and the fluids is clearly not fully reached. The Na/K ratio of the altering fluid is controlled by the albite-adularia reaction (dissolution of albite and replacement by adularia, after andesine), whilst the H2/H2S ratio is buffered by the virtually complete replacement of pyrrhotite by pyrite. The fluids are now slightly undersaturated with respect to calcite, this is shown by etched surfaces on some calcite grains. In the past the deep fluid boiled adiabatically from &gt;300&#176;C to ~250&#176;C as it ascended, resulting in the deposition of adularia, quartz and bladed calcite. The system has cooled, resulting in lower subsurface temperatures (as recorded by fluid inclusion geothermometry) suppressing boiling, and migrated northwards as a consequence of self sealing. The thermal decline and retention of CO2 in the deep alkali-chloride fluid shifted the alteration assemblage from one of albite-adularia stability to illite stability. The homogenisation (Th) temperatures of primary and secondary liquid-rich inclusions in 27 cores from different depths mostly match measured temperature profiles (e.g. OK-1 (shallow levels) and OK-2). Never-the-less, fluid inclusion data support mineral-inferred stability temperatures which indicate that parts of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system have cooled appreciably (e.g. OK-1, deep levels) and OK-4 (maximum Tbore=238&#176;C, maximum Th=312&#176;C; epidote abundant). In contrast, the northwestern margin (OK-6 area) has heated (OK-6:1113.4m; Tbore=261&#176;C, Th=210-221&#176;C). Some inclusions in the Te Kopia drillholes have Th values that exceed Tbore by as much as 50&#176;C, and are deduced to have been uplifted by movement on the Paeroa Fault. Freezing data indicate that the trapped fluid was dilute (~0.2 to 1.7 wt% NaCl equivalent) since most Tm values range from -0.1 to -0.5&#176;C. The outflow portion of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system has evolved recently, both chemically and physically. Movement on the Paeroa Fault, that uplifted pyroclastic rocks hosting a quartz-adularia-illite assemblage, combined with a lowering of the watertable has resulted in an overprinting of the neutral pH hydrothermal mineral assemblage by a kaolinite-alunite type assemblage which derives from an acid sulphate fluid. Quartz crystals found 150m above the base of the Paeroa Fault scarp host dilute (~1.5wt% NaCl equivalent) fluid inclusions with Th values that range from 180-206&#176;C (average 196&#176;C). Bladed quartz (after calcite) did not contain usable inclusions. It is deduced that the inclusions formed about 120-160m below the ground, which indicates uplift in the order of ~300m. Assuming a constant rate of uplift of 4m/ka (based on the offset of 330ka Paeroa Ignimbrite), the minimum duration of activity at Te Kopia is 75,000 years.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood pressure, cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases in eastern Asia</field><field name="creator">Rodgers, Anthony</field><field name="description">Background Considerable uncertainty exists about the strength and shape of associations of blood pressure and cholesterol with the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular death in eastern Asian populations. Therefore, uncertainty also exists about the size of the likely effects on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity of prolonged exposure changes in these populations. The Eastern Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease Collaborative Project was initiated to determine the associations of usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and usual cholesterol with the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and total cardiovascular death in cohort studies from eastern Asia. Methods A collaborative overview of cohort studies included data from 13 cohorts from the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) and five cohorts from Japan, involving a total of 124,774 participants among whom 837,214 person-years were observed. The overall mean age of participants was 47 years, 43% were current smokers and 39% were female. Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were performed, with adjustments made for several potential confounding factors. Efforts were made to correct for the bias introduced by estimation of "usual" DBP and cholesterol from measurements made at baseline (the "regression dilution" bias). The resulting estimates of associations of blood pressure and cholesterol with cardiovascular diseases were combined with data from surveys of blood pressure and cholesterol levels in Asian and other populations, estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular disease, and results from randomised trials of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering treatments to estimate the possible effects of blood pressure and cholesterol lowering. Findings The overall mean DBP at baseline was 78 mmHg. A total of 1,798 strokes were observed, of which about 45% were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or autopsy. Each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP was associated with about two-fifths lower non-haemorrhagic stroke risk and about one-half lower haemorrhagic stroke risk(-5 mmHg: odds ratio 0.56, 95% Cl: 0.53-0.59 and 0.69, 0.65-0.73, respectively). The risks were continuous throughout the range of DBP studied (baseline DBP 70-114 mmHg, usual DBP 76-97 mmHg). Each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP was associated with almost a halving of total stroke risk (-5 mmHg: 0.56, 0.53-0.59). The risk of CHD was also strongly and positively related to usual DBP (-5 mmHg: 0.73, 0.66-0.80). Since about half of all cardiovascular deaths were due to stroke, they were strongly related to blood pressure with, on average, each 5 mmHg lower usual DBP associated with about one-third fewer such deaths (-5 mmHg: 0.69, 0.65-0.73). The mean cholesterol at baseline was 4.5 mmol/l (174 mg/dl) and disease risks were assessed across a range of cholesterol levels that correspond approximately to the lower two thirds of the distribution in most Western populations (baseline cholesterol 3.4-6.7mmol/l and estimated usual cholesterol 4.15.8mmol/l). There was a trend toward a negative association of usual cholesterol with strokes classified as haemorrhagic (0.6 mmol/l lower usual cholesterol associated with odds ratio of 1.27, 95% confidence limits 0.84-1.91) and a trend toward a positive association with strokes classified as non-haemorrhagic (-0.6 mmol/l: 0.77, 0.57-1.06). The consequence of these two apparently different (P=0.06) associations, was a weak positive association of usual cholesterol with total stroke (-0.6 mmol/l: O.92, 0.72-1.17). in contrast, there was clear evidence of strong positive associations of usual cholesterol with the risks of CHD (_0.6 mmol/l: 0.47,0.31, 0.71) and of total cardiovascular death (_0.6 mmol/l: 0.58, 0.44-0.76).Overall, there was no clear indication of an interaction between the effects of cholesterol and DBP, when assessed on a multiplicative scale. The estimates of the potential effects of blood pressure lowering indicated that a 3 mmHg lower usual DBP should eventually result in about one-third fewer strokes and one-sixth fewer CHD events. If accompanied by a 0.3 mmol/l lower usual cholesterol, then eventually one-third fewer stroke and CHD events should occur. In the PRC alone, such reductions would be expected to avert over half a million deaths annually. Most events would be prevented in those without hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. World-wide, a 2% reduction in cholesterol levels would avert about 0'5 million (4%) of CHD deaths in 2020. A 2% reduction in DBP would avert an estimated 1.2 million (16%) stroke deaths and 0.6 million (6%) CHD deaths in 2020. Interpretation Blood pressure is a profoundly important determinant of cardiovascular disease in eastern Asian populations. The relationship observed here between blood pressure and total cardiovascular deaths is steeper than that typically observed in Western populations. This difference appears to be largely due to the different composition of cardiovascular deaths in Eastern populations, with a larger proportion of deaths due to conditions that are strongly related to blood pressure, such as haemorrhagic stroke. In these populations with comparatively low cholesterol from eastern Asia, there was no clear evidence of a cholesterol level below which risks of CHD or total cardiovascular death did not continue to decrease. The strength of the association of cholesterol with CHD was similar to that observed in other populations. The results suggest that modest population-wide reductions in these exposures, particularly blood pressure, could avert a large proportion of the substantial and increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in eastern Asian and other populations.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induced myopia in the guinea pig: scleral myofibroblasts and biomechanics</field><field name="creator">Backhouse, Simon</field><field name="description">Aims: To determine the effect of induced myopia on the in vivo scleral biomechanical properties and scleral cell populations in the guinea pig. Methods: One week old guinea pigs were monocularly deprived of form vision (MD) for 14 days. Cycloplegic refractive error was measured with an IR Optometer, and the results analysed using power vectors and linear mixed modelling. The in vivo ocular biomechanical response was investigated by raising the IOP to 50 mmHg for one hour in anaesthetised animals. A-scan ultrasound measures of axial length were taken every 10 minutes with raised IOP, and after returning IOP to 15 mmHg. The total cell population (DAPI antibody) and myofibroblast population (&#945;-SMA antibody) was determined in transverse scleral sections from the posterior 100 degrees of each eye. Results: The average relative myopic refractive error induced was -4.06 &#177; 0.35 D, which was mainly the result of vitreous chamber depth (VCD) elongation. This was confirmed by a negative correlation between mean sphere and VCD (R2 = 0.4295). On increasing the IOP the deprived and control eyes showed rapid viscoelastic expansion of the VCD that normal eyes did not show. When the increased IOP was maintained the deprived and control eyes showed lower creep rates than normal eyes. Myofibroblasts were shown to be present in guinea pig sclera, as previously observed in human and tree shrew sclera. On average, approximately 64% of the scleral cells were myofibroblasts. The induction of myopia had minimal effect on the cell populations, except for a decrease in total cell numbers in the 10&#176; region equivalent to the location of scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. Conclusions: Ahigh proportion of scleral cells show contractile potential in the guinea pig. Form deprivation appears to minimally affect cell numbers, except in the region equivalent to scleral crescent formation in myopic human eyes. However, the in vivo viscoelastic response of the VCD in deprived eyes differs from that in normal eyes, suggesting some factor(s) other than cell number alone has a role in axial length control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Rotenone and 6-OHDA on Dopaminergic Neurons of the Substantia Nigra Studied In Vitro</field><field name="creator">Freestone, Peter Stuart</field><field name="description">This study investigated the neurotoxic effects of rotenone and 6-hyroxydopamine (6 OHDA), two compounds which have been implicated in Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in the impairment of movement. During the disease process, a group of dopamine-containing cells in the brain region called the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc), degenerate. Whilst genetic factors contribute to approximately 5% of PD cases, the causes of the remaining 95% are unknown. What does seem clear is the pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction as observed in post-mortem human tissue. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to energy depletion and the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, despite the fact that the involvement of mitochondria in the disease process has been well established, the cellular events that lead to, and result from, mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Rotenone and 6 OHDA have been implicated in PD for two reasons: (1) both toxins can relatively selectively kill SNc neurons in animal models of PD, and (2) there is evidence for both compounds having a potential causative role in the etiology of the disease in humans. When 6 OHDA is injected into the brain, or rotenone applied systemically, both toxins cause degeneration of SNc neurons. This ability makes them excellent tools for studying mechanisms of PD in animal models. In addition, both toxins inhibit mitochondrial function. Despite extensive use in models of PD, the mechanisms by which each toxin cause cell damage remains elusive. The first part of this study investigated the acute responses of dopaminergic SNc neurons to rotenone exposure (5 nM &#8211; 1 &#181;M). The experiments were conducted on brain slices obtained from rats. Electrophysiological recordings (whole-cell patch-clamp technique) were used to detect activation of specific membrane channels as well as cell firing and changes to the membrane potential. In addition, imaging of several fluorescent dyes sensitive to specific cellular events was carried out. In voltage-clamp experiments, acute rotenone (200 nM &#8211; 1 &#181;M) application evoked a concentration-dependent outward current which was mediated by tolbutamide-sensitive KATP channels. The current was associated with a drop in cell input resistance (Rm) and, in current-clamp, membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of spontaneous action potentials. The mechanisms by which rotenone activates KATP channels is controversial, with some studies suggesting activation by ATP depletion and others by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this issue, experiments were conducted with high levels of ATP in the pipette solution. Since the rotenone-induced outward current was unaffected by high ATP levels, it was concluded that KATP channel activation was due to oxidative stress. Indeed, the antioxidant Trolox significantly attenuated the current response. Confirmation of elevated ROS production was obtained by recording increased mitochondrial superoxide production, using the fluorescent dye MitoSOX. In addition, rotenone evoked depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#936;m). Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ were performed using the fluorescent dyes Fura 2 and SBFI, respectively. Rotenone evoked increases to both [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. The rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was unaffected by blocking KATP channels with Cs+. The elevation of [Ca2+]i is particularly important in relation to cell death, since [Ca2+]i overload is known to activate pathways leading to necrosis and apoptosis. There has been growing interest in the synergistic action of rotenone with other toxins/conditions which also enhance [Ca2+]i. This concept was explored in the present study by testing the relationship between the baseline [Ca2+]i level and the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Two approaches were taken. Firstly, baseline [Ca2+]i was deliberately raised by activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. When rotenone was applied in the presence of this raised baseline calcium level, the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was significantly greater. The second approach involved post-hoc analysis of the relationship between the normal cellular variation in baseline [Ca2+]i and the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. This analysis also revealed a dependency of the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation on the baseline calcium level. From this finding, as well as the observation that rotenone evoked ROS production, Transient Receptor Protein subtype M2 (TRPM2) channels were proposed as the likely underlying mechanism. The potentiation of the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise by an elevation in baseline calcium level can be attributed to the calcium-dependence of ROS-sensitive TRPM2 channels, known to respond with increased channel opening to increased [Ca2+]i. Recent findings from our laboratory have confirmed TRPM2 involvement in rotenone toxicity, since blockade of these channels with ACA reduced the rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise (K. Chung, unpublished). Imaging using the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) to label cells with compromised membrane integrity was also conducted in acute midbrain slices. SNc neurons were retrograde-labelled with FluoroGold and then exposed to various toxic insults. The detergent Triton-X100 caused an increase in PI labelling, whilst rotenone and high concentrations of glutamate were ineffective over the period of time investigated (up to 40 min). The second part of this study, also conducted on acute rat midbrain slices, investigated the acute responses of SNc neurons to 6 OHDA (0.2 &#8211; 2 mM) exposure. Extracellular recordings of action potential firing were conducted on SNc neurons. 6 OHDA evoked rapid inhibition of firing in a similar manner to dopamine (100 &#181;M). In the presence of D2 dopamine receptor blocker sulpiride, the inhibition of firing evoked by 6 OHDA was delayed, and an initial increase of firing was observed. Blockade of the dopamine transporter with nomifensine reduced the 6 OHDA-induced inhibition of firing, and prevented the persistent inhibition of firing after 6 OHDA washout. For comparison, the response to 6 OHDA of non-dopaminergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus was also studied. In the subthalamic nucleus, 6 OHDA evoked an increase of spontaneous action potential firing. Rapid application of 6 OHDA (using the picospritz application technique) in voltage-clamp recorded SNc neurons evoked an outward current, similar to that observed after dopamine application. In the presence of sulpiride, 6 OHDA induced an inward current, consistent with the initial increase of firing activity observed in extracellular recordings. Microfluorometric experiments with Fura 2, showed that 6 OHDA evokes an increase in [Ca2+]i. Loading cells with the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow enabled visualization of 6 OHDA-induced swelling of the cell body and damage to proximal dendrites. Imaging of SNc neurons loaded with dextran-rhodamine revealed 6 OHDA-induced damage of distal dendrites. The last part of the study was performed on organotypic cultures obtained from slices of the ventral midbrain. These cultures were prepared from newborn transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the tyrosine hydroxylase-promoter. This fluorescent marker enabled easy identification of dopamine-containing cells (including SNc neurons). Only preliminary experiments were carried out using this preparation. GFP-positive neurons did not show the classic membrane hyperpolarization in response to dopamine. For comparison, recordings from GFP-positive SNc neurons in acute slices obtained from age-matched animals did show a typical hyperpolarizing response to dopamine. GFP-neurons from organotypic cultures also lacked the Ih current &#8211; another characteristic feature of SNc neurons in vivo or in acute brain slices. In addition, atypical responses to CNQX (blocker of NMDA receptors) and baclofen (blocker of GABAB receptors) application were identified in GFP-positive neurons. These results demonstrate that the culturing process used in this study alters the functional &#8216;phenotype&#8217; of dopaminergic neurons, a change which needs to be considered in future studies using this preparation. Chronic exposure of organotypic cultures to low concentration of rotenone (50 nM) evoked a delayed increase of PI labelling indicative of cell death, however technical limitations prevented detection of PI co-localization with GFP was observed. In conclusion, this study identified several key aspects of 6 OHDA and rotenone toxicity in SNc neurons. The most significant novel findings include evidence for ROS activation of KATP channels, presumed involvement of TRPM2 channels in rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i rise, and dopamine-analogous effects of 6 OHDA. The controversial role of KATP channels in neuroprotection was addressed. Findings from this study suggest therapies targeting this channel alone would be of little benefit. The proposed involvement of TRPM2 channels in rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i overload in SNc neurons is particularly interesting as it provides a mechanism for synergism between rotenone and other factors that disrupt [Ca2+]i homeostasis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="subject">Neurotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Intracellular Calcium</field><field name="subject">Reactive Oxygen Species</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">TRPM2</field><field name="subject">KATP</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and management of alligator weed,  Alternanthera philoxeroides</field><field name="creator">Bassett, Imogen Eleanor</field><field name="description">Invasive plant species in natural ecosystems have been shown to have a wide range of potential impacts on community composition and ecosystem function. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) is invasive in New Zealand and elsewhere. An aggressive competitor and difficult to control, its impacts in productive ecosystems are widely documented. However, little information exists about alligator weed&#8217;s effects in natural ecosystems. This thesis therefore investigated potential effects of alligator weed on decomposition and nutrient cycling, as well as on invertebrate and plant communities in a &#8220;native&#8221; ecosystem, thus integrating effects on ecosystem processes and community composition. These aspects were compared between vegetation dominated by alligator weed or by one of two native sedges, Isolepis prolifer and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, in a northern New Zealand lake. In addition, the potential of shading to control alligator weed was assessed. Herbivory by the biocontrol agent Agasicles hygrophila resulted in substantial alligator weed defoliation, differing in timing and magnitude from biomass dynamics of the native sedges. Alligator weed also decomposed faster than either native sedge. Changes in decomposition dynamics led to a shift towards fungivore dominated beetle communities. This illustrates the potentially complex ecosystem effects of biocontrol agents as well as invasive weeds. Alligator weed decomposition rates and invertebrate communities were more similar to those of I. prolifer than S. tabernaemontani. This pattern was attributed to the greater chemical and architectural similarity of alligator weed to I. prolifer compared with S. tabernaemontani. Invasive plants&#8217; impacts may thus be partially influenced by the degree of similarity between the invasive species and the dominant vegetation they invade. Alligator weed was associated with decreased cover of native plants, potentially placing them at greater risk of local extinction. Greenhouse and field experiments showed that shading significantly reduced alligator weed growth. However, clonal support from unshaded areas, and competitive release from less shade tolerant plants, may potentially impede the success of shade based control. This research demonstrates that alligator weed can have a range of complex and multi-trophic effects in a natural ecosystem. Further, characteristics of both invasive and competing vegetation can influence the success of cultural control methods such as shading.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Invasive species</field><field name="subject">Decomposition</field><field name="subject">Invertebrate</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the added value of coordination?:an institutional analysis of the United Nations' response to national and regional coordination of human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion</field><field name="creator">Miller, Rebecca Janine</field><field name="description">Since the 1990s, complex global problems such as HIV/AIDS, humanitarian crises, environmental degradation, and human trafficking have presented challenges at scales that transcend the nation-state as a focus for development initiatives. These challenges, in concert with the emergence of new public management rationalities and good governance discourses, have altered the mandates and capacities of different development agencies from NGOs to governments and United Nations (UN) agencies. The UN has the potential to become a leader for coordinated responses, which are seen as a prerequisite for resolving these issues. However, the marketisation and fragmentation of the development field has engendered an environment fraught with complexity, instability, and heightened competitiveness over scarce resources. The problematic nature of coordinating the activities of stakeholders in such an environment is not well understood. Effective coordination must marry ideals of cooperation to the different and often competing interests of stakeholders and to field-based development practices structured along marketised and disaggregated lines. In this thesis I explore what is meant by coordination, how it is being institutionalised, and what can be done to make initiatives more effective. This thesis examines the institutional arrangements devised to coordinate the practices of agencies working to combat human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion. It analyses the institutional forms themselves and the practices that have emerged from them. Using an ethnographic institutional approach, I focus on the workings of a UN Inter-Agency Project (UNIAP) designed to facilitate a coordinated response to human trafficking. My research draws on over 70 interviews with practitioners and government representatives from six countries, as well as close examination of project documents. To analyse this material and the institutional contexts in which they are embedded, I draw upon strands of new institutionalism and the conceptual tools of Pierre Bourdieu. I argue that the structure of the development field itself is not conducive to coordination. However, realising the potential that does exist will require that consultative platforms be built more on incentives (accumulation and exchange of resources) than on trust, equal participation, and neutral power relations. The findings suggest moving beyond the processes of market exchange toward a more realistic appraisal of hierarchies, markets, and networks as modes of governance and coordination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of spiny lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) on fished and unfished reefs</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Debbie</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the interactions among species and communities is vital for their management and protection.  Increasingly, the role of marine protected areas in this regard is being recognised, primarily because of the potential for previously-harvested species to increase in density and biomass, and the linkages among species to be restored.  Monitoring and research was conducted within and surrounding two marine reserves on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand &#8211; Te Tapuwae o Rongokako, near Gisborne, and Te Angiangi, south of Napier.  The aim was to describe the biological characteristics of spiny lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) in the absence of fishing, and to describe the effects of fishing and protection on lobster populations and the communities of which they are a component.  Diver and pot surveys showed that lobsters were significantly more abundant within the reserves than in the surrounding fisheries and that the populations were comprised of a larger proportion of legal-sized individuals.  Higher female fecundity within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve compared with the surrounding fishery was proposed to be primarily a result of increased availability of large males within the reserve.  The impact of the fishery on lobsters was also evidenced in the lower tail width to carapace length ratio of the fished population compared to the population within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve, due to the minimum legal size for Jasus edwardsii in New Zealand being based on tail width.  The largest tagging study ever to be conducted in a New Zealand marine reserve showed that sublegal male lobsters within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve were growing on average faster than the same sized individuals outside the reserve, potentially as a result of the effects of handling and / or size-selective fishing.  A decrease in growth rate over time was recorded in male lobsters within the reserve, which coincided with an increase in catch per unit effort and may indicate that density-dependent effects are operating.  Distinct seasonal movements of tagged lobsters were recorded, with the vast majority of movements taking place within reefs.  Where the boundaries of the reserve crossed reef habitat, significant movement of lobsters across the boundaries occurred.  Lobsters within Te Tapuwae o Rongokako Marine Reserve not only exhibited cannibalistic behaviour but foraged during the day, including on intertidal reef platforms at high tide, potentially as a behavioural response to increased competition for food &#8211; behaviour not previously reported for this species.  Outside the reserve, lobster bait apparently provided an alternative protein source but despite this supplementation of diet, these lobsters were in poorer nutritional condition, as evidenced by their lower body weights relative to carapace length and tail width for both sexes.  Lobsters outside the reserve were also significantly more affected by a bacterial infection associated with handling, than lobsters within the reserve.  These findings have significant implications for fisheries management and for the design and management of marine protected areas (MPAs).  This study demonstrates that many of the biological parameters used in evaluating harvest strategies in the New Zealand lobster fishery may be biased unless collected from populations with a natural size structure, such as may occur within marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lobster</field><field name="subject">marine reserves</field><field name="subject">MPAs</field><field name="subject">effects of fishing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence and phylogenetic analysis of viruses infecting New Zealand's native grasses</field><field name="creator">Delmiglio, Catia.</field><field name="description">Grasses form the basis for the meat, dairy, wool and deer industries, which contribute to nearly 50% of New Zealand exports, and are also an important component of natural ecosystems.

This research provided an extensive survey of New Zealand native grasses, showing that barley yellow dwarf virus diseases (BYDV, Luteoviridae) and Cocksfoot mottle virus (CoMV, Sobemovirus) are widespread in the North and South islands of New Zealand. Significant findings include seven new virus hosts amongst the New Zealand native flora, the first report of BYDV-PAS in New Zealand, detection in Hierochloe redolens of a novel virus in the Luteoviridae family (proposed name BYDV-To), and in Festuca novae-zelandiae a novel dsRNA virus possibly belonging to the Partitiviridae family. New virus host reports in New Zealand include CoMV in Poa anceps, P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae, and Chionochloa rubra; BYDV-PAV and BYDV-PAS in Microlaena stipoides and Dichelacne crinita; BYDV-MAV in P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae and H. redolens; and CYDV-RPV in P. cita and M. stipoides. Molecular techniques for virus detection and identification were developed or improved during this study. Phylogenetic analyses of viral coat protein sequences from native and exotic grass species indicate either frequent or recent virus movement into native ecosystems, and multiple virus introduction events in New Zealand. The likely origins of the virus species are discussed. Two CoMV variants were identified, one of which caused severe necrosis in susceptible cocksfoot cultivars. Reciprocal aphid transmission of BYDV-PAV using cereals and native grasses showed that although transmission to natives was low, the efficiency of transmission from natives to cereals was comparable to that between cereal species, suggesting virus adaptation to the cereal host species. The findings from this study are discussed in respect to disease management and bio-security in New Zealand, and recommendations are made for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure function studies on lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolases (LNPs)</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chunhong</field><field name="description">Lectin nucleotide phosphohydrolases (LNPs) are proteins which possess both apyrase catalytic activity (E.C. 3.6.1.5) and specific carbohydrate binding properties, and these are linked. To investigate the structural and functional properties for these proteins, two putative soluble plant LNPs, 4WC and 7WC (from white clover), and a putative soluble plant apyrase 6RG (from ryegrass) were chosen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for each plant apyrase were generated using highly purified, overexpressed recombinant 4WC or 7WC. In the case of 6RG, the C-terminal half of the protein constituted the best antigen for generating polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies showed high specificity and sensitivity. Active, recombinant 4WC and 6RG were overexpressed and purified using the baculoviral insect cell expression system (4WCbac-sup and 6RG:Hisbac), while 7WC (7WCcoli) was produced from E. coli inclusion bodies and subsequently refolded to give active enzyme. In course of overexpression, recombinant 4WC was localised in both the cellular fraction (4WCbac) and in the media supernatant (4WCbac-sup), while recombinant 6RG:Hisbac was only found in the cellular fraction (6RG:Hisbac) indicating that it was not secreted during insect cell growth. Secretion of 4WCbac was found to be dependent on N-glycosylation at N313 but not at N85 and elimination of one or both of these sites appeared to have little influence on apyrase activity. In addition, both 4WCbac and 6RG:Hisbac from the cellular fraction were fully functional. These results were compared with similar work performed on the animal ecto-apyrases which have different specific N-glycosylation sites required for secretion and activity. The 4WCbac-sup, 7WCcoli and 6RG:Hisbac proteins all showed apyrase activity, that is they catalysed the hydrolysis of nucleotide tri- and/or di-phosphates to their corresponding nucleotide monophosphates, and released inorganic phosphate in a divalent cation-dependent manner. However, the proteins exhibited different activities, substrate specificities, pH profiles and influence of inhibitors: 4WCbac-sup had a preference for NDPs with a pH optimum &#8805;9.5; 7WCcoli had a modest preference for NTPs with a pH optimum at 8.5; 6RG:Hisbac was almost exclusively an NTPase with a pH optimum at 6.5. Contrary to predictions based on phylogeny the proteins all bound to sulphated disaccharides and their catalytic activities were influenced both positively and negatively by the binding of specific chitosans. The data indicates that all three soluble plant apyrases investigated here were LNPs, in contrast to predictions from the literature. In order to pinpoint the regions responsible for determining substrate specificity and chitosan binding, chimeras were made using the N- and C-terminal halves of 4WC and 6RG. This resulted in fully functional reciprocal chimeras. Comparison of the apyrase activity for parents and chimeras, substrate specificity, optimal pH, influence of inhibitors on activity and effects of chitosans indicated that the C-terminus was responsible for determining substrate specificity. However, the influence of specific chitosans on the chimeras appeared to be dependent on both the N- and C-terminal portions of the proteins. In addition, chimeras were found to bind to the same sulphated disaccharides as the parent proteins. Preliminary crystal screening experiments were performed with highly purified preparations of 7WCcoli and 6RG:Hisbac. Under specific conditions 7WCcoli was found to form cube-like crystalline arrangements while 6RG:Hisbac formed hexagonal-like crystalline structures. A potential model for carbohydrate binding by LNPs is proposed and the possible biological roles of plant LNPs are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apyrase</field><field name="subject">lectin</field><field name="subject">prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein expression</field><field name="subject">chimeras</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximizing Information: Applications of Ideal Point Modeling and Innovative Item Design to Personality Measurement</field><field name="creator">Leeson, Heidi Vanessa</field><field name="description">Recent research has challenged the way in which personality and attitude constructs are measured. Alternatives have been offered as to how non-cognitive responses are modeled, the mode of delivery used when administrating such scales, and the impact of technology in measuring personality. Thus, the major purpose of the studies in this thesis concerns two interrelated issues of personality research, namely the way personality responses are best modeled, and the most optimal mode by which personality items are presented and associated modal issues. Three studies are presented. First, recent developments using an ideal point approach to scale construction are outlined, and an empirical study compares modeling personality items based on an ideal point approach (generalized graded unfolding model; GGUM) and a dominance approach (graded response model: GRM). Second, an extensive review of literature pertaining to the mode effect when transferring paper-and-pencil measures to screen was conducted, in addition to a review of the various types of computerized and innovative items and their associated psychometric information. Finally, nine innovative items were developed using various multimedia features (e.g., video, graphics, and audio) to ascertain the advantages of these methods to present items constructed to elicit response behavior underlying ideal point approaches, namely, typical response behavior. It was found that the dominance IRT model continued to produce superior model-data fit for most items, more attention needs to be placed on developing principles for constructing ideal point type items, the web-based version supplied 20% more construct information than the paper version, and innovative items seem to provide more data-model fit for students with lower personality attributes. While the innovative items may require more initial outlay in terms of time and development costs, they have the capacity to provide more information regarding test-takers&#8217; personality levels, potentially using fewer items.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ideal Point Theory</field><field name="subject">Innovative items</field><field name="subject">Web-based testing</field><field name="subject">Computer-based testing</field><field name="subject">Personality measurement</field><field name="subject">Psychometrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330109 Assessment and evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330107 Educational technology and media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polynesian architecture in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Austin, Michael Robert</field><field name="description">Polynesian architecture has tended to be neglected or dismissed as a field of serious study by architects in New Zealand.

Through better communication and considering the structure and foundation as an integrated system, new opportunities may arise for achieving superior performance. This thesis investigates the seismic performance of the integrated system through the development of integrated structure-foundation models using the Ruaumoko structural analysis program. A detailed representation of the structural and foundation systems was created using Ruaumoko, providing insight into the response of a range of integrated structure-foundation systems during seismic loading. In developing both shallow and deep foundation models, some modifications were made to Ruaumoko elements in order to improve the foundation model, but generally existing element configurations were used to represent foundations. Multiple structural and foundation designs were developed using a range of approaches. Use of a range of shallow foundation design methods identified the significant impact that moment loading had on foundation performance. Partial uplift of footings was identified as detrimental to footing performance as it shifted the rotational axes, increasing moment loads and reducing effective footing area. Pinned connections between the structure and shallow footings eliminated these effects at the expense of significant redistribution of actions in the structure and increased displacements. Variation of soil conditions showed that softer soil was most likely to reduce demands on the structure at the expense of foundation non-linearity. Reduced stiffness and increased radiation damping characteristics of raft foundations compared to footing foundation systems reduced the demands on three storey structures for all soil conditions. Increased structural demands were identified for the ten storey structure as a result of the reduced impact of foundation characteristics on the response of the integrated system. The level of rotational restraint at the head of pile foundations had a considerable effect on the structure and the foundation, with free-head piles developing the largest pile displacements and actions. Reduced rotational stiffness caused a substantial change in the distribution of structural actions, while increasing rotational restraint moved the characteristics closer to the response of fixed base models. Softer soil conditions greatly increased non-linearity in the foundation soil without any definitive improvement in structural performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earthquake Engineering</field><field name="subject">Soil Structure Interaction</field><field name="subject">Analytical Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaving a lot to be desired? Sex therapy and the discourses of heterosex</field><field name="creator">Guerin, Bernadette M.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the social construction of sexuality and sexual dysfunction. Interviews were undertaken with 20 sex therapists practising in Aotearoa/New Zealand in order to elicit accounts of contemporary sex therapy practice in the local context. Using a feminist poststructuralist lens, I explicate and critically examine the dominant discourses informing the construction of sex therapy, and heterosexual sexual relations, and what these discourses enable and constrain. I draw attention to some of the assumptions embedded in the construction of the sexual dysfunctions in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, APA, 2000), and in accounts of sex therapy practice, examining the ways in which these are based on taken-for-granted norms of (hetero)sexuality and highlighting the differently enabled gendered sexual subjectivities they (re)produce. Although there are nine sexual dysfunctions identified in the DSM-IV-TR, all of which I briefly outline in Chapter Four, I restrict my focus in the analytical chapters to the conceptualisation and treatment of vaginismus, orgasm difficulties in women, discrepancies in desire and, relatedly, the gendering of desire through powerful sociocultural discourses and representations. I pay particular attention to the implications of these for heterosexual women&#8217;s sexuality. I also explore some of the generic concepts that dominate the construction of therapy at a broader level than that of sex therapy alone, arguing that while these offer some useful ways of framing therapy they also constrain therapy practice in important ways. Through a critical review of the sex therapy literature and accounts of practice from those interviewed, I contend that contemporary sex therapy tends to reify dominant cultural and sexological norms rather than challenge them. My analyses show that the dominant discourses informing constructions of sex therapy and heterosexual sexual relations produce particular types of sex as normal whilst marginalizing sexual acts or practices that fall outside of such restrictive parameters. In particular, I argue that the genital-coital-orgasm construct that is hegemonic within sex therapy restricts possibilities for alternative erotic pleasures and possibilities amongst heterosexuals whilst contributing to the invisibilization of sexual identities other than heterosexual. Accounts of sex therapy practice that were able to contest such framings are also highlighted. Because these came from sex therapists drawing on radical feminist or feminist poststructuralist discourses, I suggest that these discourses offer important possibilities for a deconstructive (sex) therapy practice that is able to challenge an often inequitable sexual status quo. Attention is also drawn to the significant constraints which act to restrict clients&#8217; choices and possibilities for sex therapists to practise in more critically questioning ways. I conclude this thesis with an &#8216;invitation to reflection&#8217; where I briefly discuss some deconstructive approaches that I have found useful for developing ongoing reflexive analysis of my own taken-for-granted assumptions in the area of sexuality, and for aiding my thinking about therapeutic practices that support my political and theoretical commitments and that attend to some of the issues outlined in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social construction of sexuality</field><field name="subject">social constructionism</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructuralist approach to sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual dysfunction</field><field name="subject">sexual disorders</field><field name="subject">heterosexual sexual relations</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">heterosex</field><field name="subject">dominant discourses of sexuality</field><field name="subject">sex therapy</field><field name="subject">deconstruction of sex therapy practices</field><field name="subject">orgasm difficulties</field><field name="subject">vaginismus</field><field name="subject">desire discrepancy</field><field name="subject">gendering of desire</field><field name="subject">deconstructive approaches to sex therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and numerical modelling of bacterial colony growth on high nutrient surfaces</field><field name="creator">Pipe, Leonie Zandra</field><field name="description">Traditionally, growth and morphology studies of bacteria have focused on individual cells. When microbiologists subsequently became interested in bacterial colony growth, they investigated the dynamics of its height as well as those of its diameter. The models they proposed, however, were little more than empirical. In recent decades there has been a shift in focus, as researchers became interested instead in the morphology changes that colonies undergo when exposed to stressful environments such as nutrient and moisture limitation. As a result of this shift, models of colony growth in three dimensions have remained underdeveloped and rudimentary. My first task in this thesis was to assemble a sufficiently comprehensive data set from which diameter, height and cell-number growth trends in colonies could be properly analysed. This was achieved by studying the growth of many colonies of two bacterial species, Serratia marcescens and Esherichia coli, on high-nutrient non-selective agar, over a range of incubation temperatures, over periods ranging from two hours to one week. When graphed and analysed, colony diameter and colony height growth turned out to be most economically described as power-law in time, with exponent &lt; 1. This contrasts with the claims of previous researchers, who had described both growth trends as linear, with diameter switching to a slower yet still linear growth after a certain time, and height growth ceasing altogether. From my results, I proposed a simple conceptual model, an extension of a model developed by Pirt in 1967. My hypothesis was that, in colonies growing on high-nutrient surfaces, diffusion was the dominant factor in colony growth. Ron Keam transformed my conceptual model into a mathematical one, from which I have developed one-dimensional and twodimensional numerical simulations. In all simulations to date, in both one and two dimensions, a power-law growth phase emerges as a consequence of nutrient-controlled growth, preceded by an &#8220;accelerating&#8221; phase during which colony growth overtakes diffusive processes, and succeeded by a slow transition towards growth cessation as nutrient becomes exhausted. In addition to successful demonstration of the power laws, the model in its final form yields realistic colony profiles and exhibits other features consistent with experimental results reported in the literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual Reality Simulation of Hip Surgery</field><field name="creator">Blyth, Phil</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the design and application of a virtual reality simulator for orthopaedic surgeryof the proximal femur. The aim of the research was to create a simulator with the followingattributes; could be used within the current public hospital setting, reflected the perceived needs ofthe local orthopaedic community, provided surgically relevant feedback about aspects of technicalability to orthopaedic surgical trainees and the training committee, allowed practice of operativetasks which for reasons of radiation exposure could otherwise not occur, was validated, and couldbe developed further for other operations. The ultimate aim of the simulator is to allow trainees topractice aspects of surgical treatment such that their care of real patients is improved. The novel aspect of this work has been the development of a simulator which allows the trainee toperform all the steps required for two surgical procedures; namely hip fracture fixation and pinningof slipped femoral capital epiphyses. The simulator runs on the computers found within the publichospital as it does not require expensive hardware such as haptic (force feedback) devices. Resultsfrom the simulator mimic real world measurements which are seldom available to trainees asfeedback to enable them to practice their craft. A survey of the New Zealand orthopaedic surgeons and advanced trainees showed this communitywas generally supportive of simulation, though only 4 respondents had previous experience with asurgical simulator. The task of practicing angulation/spatial orientation was thought most suitablefor simulation, which is the task which the simulator specifically allows trainees to practice. Morerecently qualified surgeons were more likely to agree that simulation was an effective way topractice surgical procedures. Validation of the simulator was tested in two experiments. The simulator was shown to have facevalidity; i.e. a realistic representation of the operating room. This result was obtained by surveyingusers who had completed a number of virtual operations. Construct validity was assessed by thesimulator&#8217;s ability to identify between groups of users with differing levels of real surgicalexperience. The simulator was able to discriminate medical students from orthopaedic trainees,despite the medical students&#8217; greater ability in computer-gaming. Advanced trainees generallyperformed better than basic trainees, though in the limited number of trainees available significancewas not reached. Finally the simulator was developed further to allow all advanced trainees within New Zealand tocomplete virtual pin placement of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. This demonstrated thefeasibility of using the simulator for assessment of trainees within their normal training weekend. Italso revealed different operating styles, and showed how these differing styles do not correlate withthe accuracy with which the final screw is placed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual Reality</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The substance of the shadow: M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; political economic relationships, 1860-1940: a far northern case study</field><field name="creator">Puckey, Adrienne, 1946</field><field name="description">Between 1860 and 1940 Aotearoa New Zealand&#8217;s economy and economic base was transformed in a number of significant ways, following similar patterns in earlier-established British colonies. The influx of European immigrants drastically altered the demography and contested land &#8211; the economic base. Money became increasingly important as medium of exchange and unit of account. Whereas the economy was unregulated or lightly-regulated before 1860, regulation increasingly formalised economic relations and institutions, and work organisation became more impersonal. In urban areas these transformations were substantially complete by 1940. However, in rural areas, where most M&#228;ori and fewer P&#228;keh&#228; lived, economic transformation was more of a hybrid than a complete change from one form to another. The informal economy (unmeasured and unregulated), and particularly the rural informal economy, contributed (and still contributes) quantitatively to the national economy. Whether within M&#228;ori communities, within P&#228;keh&#228; communities or between the two, the more informal rural economy depended on social relations to a large extent. M&#228;ori had choices about how they related to the introduced economic system, ranging from full engagement to rejection and non-involvement, with numerous negotiated positions in between. With the conviction that they could satisfactorily negotiate terms of participation, M&#228;ori had invited Europeans to the far north. The extent of M&#228;ori involvement in all the dominant (formal) economic activities of the far north, 1860-1940, clearly indicates their efforts were integral rather than peripheral to the P&#228;keh&#228; economy. But M&#228;ori economic activity has been relegated to the shadows of economic history. The relationship between the two systems is better understood by recognising the interplay between formal and informal (shadow) economies. The social organisation of work, the kaupapa of the informal economy, the diversity of strategies and tactics, and relationship building (both bonding and bridging), were the strengths from which far northern M&#228;ori relentlessly engaged with the P&#228;keh&#228; economy, while maintaining a degree of autonomy until World War One. In effect they played an invisible hand of cards, invisible, that is, to studies of the formal economy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430102 History: Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust and integrated airline scheduling</field><field name="creator">Weide, Oliver</field><field name="description">In airline scheduling a variety of planning and operational decision problems have to be solved. In this thesis we consider the problems aircraft routing and crew pairing: aircraft and crew must be allocated to flights of a schedule in a minimal cost way.  Although these problems are not independent, they are usually formulated as independent mathematical optimisation models and solved sequentially. This approach might lead to a suboptimal allocation of aircraft and crew, since a solution of one of the problems may restrict the set of feasible solutions of the problem solved subsequently.  Also, in minimal cost solutions, aircraft and crew are highly utilised and short turn around times are usually used for aircraft and crew. If such a solution is used in operations, a short delay of one flight can cause very severe disruptions of the schedule later in the day due to the lack of buffer times. We formulate an integrated aircraft routing and crew pairing  model that can generate solutions that incur small costs and are also robust to typical stochastic variability in airline operations.  We propose two new solution methods to solve the integrated model. The first approach is an optimisation based heuristic approach that is capable of generating good quality solutions quickly, the second approach can solve the integrated model to optimality.  In an extension of the integrated model we allow the departure times of some flights in the schedule to vary in some time window. This creates additional flexibility that leads to aircraft routing and crew pairing solutions with improved cost and robustness compared to the integrated model without time windows.  Using data from domestic Air New Zealand schedules, we evaluate the benefits of the approaches on real world problem instances. Our solutions satisfy all rules imposed for these problems and are ready to be implemented in practice. We generate solutions that dramatically improve the cost and robustness of solutions obtained by existing methods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">airline scheduling</field><field name="subject">robust</field><field name="subject">integrated</field><field name="subject">set partitioning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accessing the in between: The conditions of possibility emerging from interactions with information and communications technologies in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Phillipa Marlis</field><field name="description">The complex interactions between individuals, institutions and information and communications technologies (ICTs) have generated a growing body of research that seeks greater knowledge of the processes at work and their consequences. Situated firmly within this area, this thesis challenges the dominance of the generalised and largely technologically deterministic narratives within the field by seeking to constitute such knowledge in a different way.  Geography provides a useful standpoint from which to challenge these narratives owing to its enduring engagement with time and space, concepts implicit in any discussion of ICTs effects.  Emerging work on code space, transurbanism and timespace are specifically used to negate the persistent dualistic treatment of time and space which is argued to be hampering geographic research in this field.  Methodologically drawing from a non representational style this thesis uses these emerging understandings to access the in between, a mental space of performance; which involves the process of drawing from tacit knowledge, cognitive perceptions of the spatial and temporal environment and emotions, in order to explore the conditions of possibility that individuals are becoming aware of through their interactions with ICTs.  Four empirical interventions are used to ground these emerging understandings into the reality of everyday encounters with ICTs in Auckland, New Zealand.  The first focuses on the role of local government in the development of Auckland&#8217;s ICT infrastructure, a complex and contingent process.  The second concentrates on the provision of a Real Time Passenger Information System at Auckland bus stops, exposing individuals to new timespaces while waiting for the bus.  The third considers students opinions of the e-learning mechanisms used in two first year geography courses.  The final intervention examines the role ICTs play in South Africans and South Koreans imagining, negotiation and mediation of the migration process to Auckland.  In conclusion, this thesis contributes to how geography constitutes knowledge about ICTs at three different levels.  Empirically, the four interventions contribute grounded findings to the debates in the geographic literature over interactions with ICTs.  Methodologically, the conditions of possibility institutional and individual actors are beginning to perceive through their encounters with ICTs are revealed as are the timespaces that may eventuate from these. Theoretically, to understand how the interactions between individuals and ICTs are performed this thesis demonstrates the need to interrogate the in between as a process, not just a gap or blank.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communications technologies</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">non representational theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated techniques for formal verification of SoCs</field><field name="creator">Sinha, Roopak</field><field name="description">System-on-a-chip (SoC) designs have gained immense popularity as they provide designers with the ability of integrating all components (called IPs) of an application-specific computer system onto a single chip. However, one of the main bottlenecks of the SoC design cycle is the validation of complex designs. As system size grows, validation time increases beyond manageable limits. It is desirable that design inconsistences are found and fixed early in the design process, as validation overheads are significantly higher after IPs are integrated. This thesis presents a range of techniques for the automatic verification and design of SoCs that aim to reduce post-integration validation costs. Firstly, local module checking algorithm, a practical implementation of module checking, is presented. This technique allows for the comprehensive verification of IPs such that they guarantee the satisfaction of critical specifications regardless of the SoC they are used in. Local module checking is shown to be able to validate IPs in much lesser time on average than global module checking, and can help in handling many important validation tasks much before the integration stage. Next, a number of protocol conversion techniques that assist in the composition of IPs with incompatible protocols is presented. The inconsistencies between IP protocols, called mismatches, are bridged by the automatic generation of some extra glue-logic, called a converter. Converters generated by the proposed techniques can handle control, datawidth and clock mismatches between multiple IPs in a unified manner. These approaches ensure that the integration of IPs is correct-by-construction, such that the final system is guaranteed to satisfy key specifications without the need for further validation. Finally, a technique for automatic IP reuse using forced simulation is presented, which involves automatically generating an adaptor that guides an IP such that it satisfies desired specifications. The proposed technique can generate adaptors in many cases where existing IP techniques fail. As it is guaranteed that reused IPs satisfy desired specifications, post-integration validation costs are significantly reduced. For each proposed technique, a comprehensive set of results is presented that highlights the significance of the solution. It is noted that the proposed approaches can help automate SoC design and achieve significant savings in post-integration validation costs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallographic studies of interactions between ligands and DNA oligonucleotides</field><field name="creator">Pytel, Patrycja Dominika</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two major chapters, each with its own introduction, experimental section and discussion. The TG4T/daunomycin and G4/daunomycin complexes described in Chapter One are two out of only five crystallographic quadruplex/ligand structures reported to date. In both structures daunomycin molecules stack onto a terminal G quartet preventing the G4 quadruplex from destacking and unwinding. The number of interacting ligand molecules depends on the quadruplex structure itself. The G4 quadruplex can accommodate four daunomycin molecules within one layer, while the TG4T tetraplex only accommodates three. In both structures daunosamine moieties form hydrogen bonds with the quadruplex but only daunosamine moieties from the TG4T/daunomycin structure make slight incursions into the quadruplex grooves.  Both structures are stabilised by &#960;-&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals contacts and electrostatic interactions. The daunomycin/TG4T complex is the first ever reported and the only structure where a ligand interacts directly with the quadruplex groove. Chapter Two describes nine crystal structures of Hoechst 33258 analogues with d(CGCAAATTTGCG)2 and d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 oligonucleotides, and is divided into two sections. Section A includes seven structures with Halogenated Hoechst 33258 analogues that are potential agents in radiotherapy, phototherapy, radioimmunotherapy or photoimmunotherapy, and the structure of the precursor. In all of the examined complexes the ligand binds to the minor groove but not all halogen substituents refine to 100% occupancy.  The refined occupancies of the halogen atoms reveal that the degree of carbon-halogen cleavage is highest for ortho and lowest for para substitution. Among meta substituents pointing outside the minor groove, bromine atoms had a higher occupancy than the larger iodines. The position of the halogen atom in the minor groove is influenced by additional substituents on the phenyl ring. In most cases the bulky halogen atom is facing outside of the minor groove. Only in the 3-iodo-5-isopropylHoechst complex is iodine positioned towards the floor of the groove allowing the big isopropyl group to face outside. Section B describes the structure of a carborane-containing ligand (JW-B) bound to the minor groove of d(CGCAAATTTGCG)2. The analysis shows that is possible to position boron-rich moieties close to the cell nucleus, and JW-B may have potential in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quadruplex</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">X-ray</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Crystal</field><field name="subject">Daunomycin</field><field name="subject">Anti-cancer drug</field><field name="subject">Hoechst 33258</field><field name="subject">Phototherapy</field><field name="subject">Dehalogenation</field><field name="subject">Ligand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of pavement deterioration models on the state highway network of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Henning, Theunis F.P.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of developing road pavement deterioration models for the State Highway network in New Zealand pavement deterioration models are an integral part of pavement management systems, which are used to forecast long-term maintenance needs and funding requirements on a road network.  As part of this research, a Long-term Pavement Performance (LTPP) programme has been established on 63 sections of the State Highways.  These sections are representative of typical road sections and climatic conditions on New Zealand roads.  Data collection on these sections is undertaken on an annual basis and consists of high accuracy manual measurements.  These measurements include road roughness, rutting, visual defect identification and strength testing with a Falling Weight Deflectometer. Based on the LTPP data, new model formats for New Zealand conditions were developed including a crack initiation model and a three-stage rut progression model.  The rut progression model consists of three stages, initial densification, stable rut growth and a probabilistic model to predict accelerated rut progression.  The continuous probabilistic model developed predicts the initiation of pavement failure events such as crack initiation and accelerated rutting.  It has been found that this model type has a strong agreement with actual pavement behaviour as it recognises a distribution of failure on roads rather than failure occurring at an particular point in time, namely, a year.  The modelling of rut progression in the three stages including, initial densification, stable rut progression and accelerated rutting has resulted in a significant increased understanding of this defect, especially for thin flexible chip seal pavements.  It has been established that the in-service performance of these pavements is relatively predictable.  However, incorporating both the in-service performance and the failure of pavements into one model was unrealistic.  Therefore, by having the different stages of rutting, resulted into a more accurate forecasting of this defect. Although this research has covered the two priority pavement models including cracking and rutting prediction, it has established the model framework for other pavement models to be developed.  As more data become available, further work can be undertaken to refine the models and to extend the research into the performance of alternative construction materials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pavement deterioration</field><field name="subject">pavement models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shining new light on motoneurons: characterization of motoneuron dendritic spines using light microscopy and novel analytical methods</field><field name="creator">McMorland, Angus John Cathcart</field><field name="description">Dendritic spines are fundamental units of information processing within the nervous system, responsible for independent modulation of synaptic input to neurons. Filopodia, often morphologically indistinguishable from spines, are involved in formation of synapses during neuronal development. Despite the importance of these structures for neuronal function, no detailed study of their presence on motoneurons has yet been made. Here, the presence of spines on hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) is described at three developmental stages: at P0&#8211;2 and P9&#8211;11, spines are present at an average density of ~0.1 spines/micron, but at P19 spine density becomes negligible. In P0&#8211;2 and P9&#8211;11, spines are nonuniformly distributed, occuring in clusters, and at lower density in the most proximal and distal regions to the soma than at intermediate regions. HM spines coincide with a decrease in cell input resistance, which reduces excitability during development. Thus one may speculate that these spines are involved in the formation of new synapses required to maintain adequate excitatory drive. A major difficulty for the study of spines is their small size, which complicates measurement using optical methods. Here, I present a novel method for reconstructing spine morphology using geometric models based on a priori knowledge of spine structure. Tests of the technique using simulated data indicate that it has a resolving capability of up to 40 nm (limited by noise). The technique has been used to measure dendritic spines on HMs, showing that these structures have necks as small as 0.22 micron. For purely passive modulation of synaptic strength, spine necks need to be &lt;~ 0.15 micron. These data suggest that if modulation of synaptic input occurs, biochemical and/or active electrical processes are needed. The methods developed in this Thesis, which have here been applied to HMs, are generally applicable to the study of spine morphology, and its effect on synaptic processing, in all classes of neurons.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">dendritic spines</field><field name="subject">high resolution</field><field name="subject">two-photon</field><field name="subject">fluorescence</field><field name="subject">mice</field><field name="subject">motoneuron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320702 Central nervous system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology::320602 Cell physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::249900 Other Physical Sciences::249903 Instruments and techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justice in context: judging battered women defendants: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Simmonds, Sally Charlotte.</field><field name="description">The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the practical limits and scope of the substantive concept and principles of justice in response to a growing philosophical scepticism about the relevance and substance of the virtue of justice in the modern world. This critical reflection on justice is set in an actual context of considerable controversy surrounding the commitment to justice and compelling claims about the failure of the &#8216;justice system&#8217; to fulfil those commitments. This context encompasses debates and decisions about justice for battered women defendants. The first part of the thesis develops an extended empirical case study of the New Zealand &#8216;justice system&#8217; centred on the 1994 trial of Gay Oakes who killed her abusive husband and was convicted of his murder. Using this legal case as a critical point of departure for reflection on New Zealand&#8217;s commitment to justice for battered women defendants and for women victims of domestic violence more broadly, the case study includes a detailed overview of the legal, political and cultural aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s changing commitment to justice for battered women, concentrating on the twenty-year period between 1987 and 2007. The study overall reveals the complexity of the justice challenge in this context and raises serious concerns about the ongoing failure to meet the demands of justice in spite of significant progress made. The second part of the thesis engages in analytical reflection on the key principles of justice conceptualised in western political philosophy and underpinning the institutionalised commitment to justice in New Zealand. Divided into three distinct principles of justice &#8211; the principle of equal treatment or formal justice, the principle of equal consent, and the principle of just deserts &#8211; the analysis in this part of the thesis endeavours to translate each principle of justice defined in abstraction, based on hypothetical and universal dilemmas, to apply in specific contexts of judging what justice demands for battered women defendants. Although serious complexities of &#8216;translation&#8217; arise in each case, the analysis points to the conclusion that the sceptics are wrong to doubt the substance and relevance of justice, and that justice remains an important legal, political and moral virtue capable of guiding judgments in complex contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding of additives to functional polyolefins by reactive blending</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Ann Jennifer</field><field name="description">This study examined the concept of using a reactive blending process to develop new polymeric additive systems. The objective was to investigate the potential of using a reactive processing technique as a means to bond additives to functional polymers, to create &#8220;in situ&#8221; bonds between functional groups present on the polymers and those present on the additives. The work is reported in two parts; the first part studied the bonding of colorants to functional polyolefins and the second part investigated the bonding of UV stabilisers to functional polyolefins. The research was completed with the long term objective that the approach should offer alternative additives to conventional non-bonded systems for use in polypropylene. An ethylene ionomer was utilised for the bonding of dyes, this was chosen for its optical clarity and chemical functionality. Polyethylene methacrylic acid (EMAA) ionomers and methine dyes were blended in the melt phase using an internal mixer to produce bright intrinsically colored polymers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in transmission mode was used to assess the bonding of the dye to the ionomer. Bonding resulted through electrostatic interactions between carboxylate groups on the ionomer and cations on the dye molecules. The reactive blending process also resulted in a change in the chromophoric structure of the dye. The bonded system was compared to a system whereby no bonding between the methine dye and polymer was expected. In the later system the methine dye was blended with polyethylene using an internal mixer. From FTIR results no interaction was observed between the dye and polyethylene in this system. This was supported by microscopic analysis that showed that the dye was present in the polyethylene as a dispersion. The second stage of research focussed on the UV stabilisation of polyolefins. A melt reaction was explored between polypropylene functionalised with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and an alkoxyamine hindered amine light stabiliser (NOR-HALS) with hydroxyl functionality. The technology proposed is based upon the reaction between the carboxylic acid groups of maleated polypropylene and hydroxyl groups of a specific NOR-HALS (Tinuvin 152). The efficiency of the modification was assessed using FTIR to verify the esterification reaction between the NOR-HALS and the maleated polypropylene. This reaction resulted in the grafting of a pendant UV stabiliser to the polypropylene through an ester linkage. A twin-screw extruder (TSE) was used to complete this study. A larger quantity of material could be produced using a TSE compared to the colorant system where an internal mixer was used. Samples of the reactively blended materials were exposed to UV radiation for a maximum time period of three hundred hours to assess the resulting stability of the materials. Diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided an effective means to study oxidative degradation. IR spectroscopic measurements were used to determine the effectiveness of HALS in inhibiting the photo-oxidation of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene. The inhibition was quantified by measuring the formation of carbonyl groups, with and without HALS bonded to the polymer, at fixed exposure times of UV radiation. DRIFT and XPS analysis confirmed that stabilised samples oxidised less, as indicated by the lower carbonyl index values and O1s / C1s ratios. These findings were complemented by results from Charpy impact tests. The mechanical property results indicated that the longevity of the materials with UV stabilisers grafted to them exceeded the PPg- MA system where there was no stabiliser present. Visible spectrophotometry was used to assess the colour of the polymeric samples and change in colour following exposure to UV radiation. Samples with bonded HALS demonstrated greater colour stability than control samples. The microstructure of the polymer surfaces was viewed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The polymeric samples demonstrated resistance to crazing when the NOR-HALS were bonded to the polymer. For both the colorant and UV stabiliser areas of research, thermal properties of the materials were assessed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that increasing the additive concentration in the polymer resulted in an increase in the temperature of crystallisation (Tc). Melt flow index can indicate if any change in molar mass had occurred during processing. An increase in melt flow index values (MFI) was observed when additive loading increased which suggested that degradation of the polymer had occurred during processing. In summary, reactive processing showed considerable promise as a means to bond additives to a functional polypropylene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reactive blending</field><field name="subject">polyolefin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotope analysis of prehistoric human and commensal diet on Aitutaki, southern Cook Islands</field><field name="creator">Craig, Jacqueline Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the prehistoric diet of humans and two of their key commensals on Aitutaki using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes.  This technique gives us new insight into the diet of these three groups and results are considered in the context of the development of agricultural systems on Aitutaki, as well as in light of the wider context of cultural developments and environmental change in the Cook Islands and Polynesia as a whole.  Ultimately, it allows us to more fully understand the complex interactions between humans and the two largest commensals in order to evaluate the utility of these animals as proxies for humans in dietary analyses. The results indicate that the prehistoric human diet on Aitutaki can be characterised as mixed, dominated by terrestrial plants and marine protein with lesser amounts of terrestrial protein.  While the amount of protein eaten by the individuals was very similar, they varied in how much marine or terrestrial protein they ate.  The pigs had a slightly more terrestrial diet, with a greater emphasis on plant foods.  Their protein intake was more variable and terrestrial in nature than the humans&#8217;.  Dogs had a higher trophic level, more marine-oriented, diet than either humans or pigs. Like the humans, their diet contained more variation in the source of their protein.  Overall, however, the diets of all three groups were very similar. While the overall nature of the human, pig and dog diets, and their relationships to one another, remained relatively constant over time, beginning in the 14th century they show a decline in the amount of fish consumed and had a more terrestrial diet overall.  This confirms trends seen in the archaeofaunal assemblages, and throws light on the relationship between environmental change and human subsistence practices in East Polynesia. The similarity of the pig and dog diets to human diet, and the fact that the relationship remained constant over time, demonstrates the usefulness of the Aitutaki commensal animals as proxies for humans in stable isotope analysis. However, the specifics of that relationship vary by species and by place.  While the individual dietary variability provides us with new ways of looking at dietary change within populations, it also demonstrates the importance of obtaining as large an assemblage for analysis as possible in order to ensure that samples are representative of the population as a whole.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotopes</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">palaeodiet</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">pig</field><field name="subject">dog</field><field name="subject">Polynesia</field><field name="subject">Cook Islands</field><field name="subject">Aitutaki</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's National Archives: an analysis of machinery of government reform and resistance, 1994-1999.</field><field name="creator">Molineaux, Julienne</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the impact of the1990s new public management reforms in New Zealand on one particular agency, the National Archives. It explores the unique combination of features that enabled this small low-profile agency and its stakeholders to stymie some of the machinery of government reforms that were proposed. This thesis is a qualitative study that draws on material from primary and secondary sources, with a heavy reliance on official documents. It chronicles the lack of value placed on the archives&#8217; administrative, constitutional and heritage functions by successive politicians and senior public servants. The thesis compares the values of the reformers, who had interests that were not specific to the Archives, and the values of the archiving professionals and their stakeholders, whose perspective was agency and policy-specific. The main reform time periods are 1994-2001, and 2005. While the clash between the two sets of values during this time is analysed chronologically, the thesis provides historical background prior to the reform period. The perspectives of various actors are told in their own words, where possible. This study illustrates the tensions between the need to co-ordinate the wider public sector with the peculiarities of a specific policy area. It also demonstrates the tensions between the highly theoretical and ideological nature of the public sector management reforms in New Zealand from the mid-1980s, and the values of one group of professionals that were not compatible with these reforms. While the policies of the reformers evolved over time, the values of the archivists were more static. These static values contributed to consistency in their preferred model of organisational design and placement within the public sector. Ironically the outdated legislation archivists complained about for decades and low political priority the policy area received, bestowed crucial protection against public sector management reforms that were contrary to international archival trends. Following a change in political leadership, the stable of professional values of the archive were adopted, removing archives from the policy change agenda.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative girls: fashion design education and governmentality</field><field name="creator">Bill, Amanda Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with creativity as an object of educational governance and a category of subjective identification. It studies a &#8216;creativity explosion&#8217; in higher education in New Zealand, focusing on how fashion design students are being mobilized as subjects of creativity through &#8216;joined up&#8217; modes of governance and technologies of educational choice. Using a poststructural ethnographic &#8216;methodology&#8217; I explain how, from the late 1990s, models of educational governance began to appear dysfunctional and unable to deliver the attributes and capacities expected of citizens in a knowledge economy. I argue that creativity gained significance as a result of new ways of &#8216;thinking culture and economy together&#8217;. Neoliberal rhetorics representing creativity as flexible human capital and a generic, transferable skill needed by workers in the new economy, were articulated with liberal humanist notions about creativity, which are commonly understood and performed through the social categories of art. All kinds of individual and institutional actors took advantage of these shifting opportunity structures to position themselves with &#8216;creative&#8217; identities. Within various cultural organisations, including universities, moves to strengthen a liberal agenda and retain creativity as a form of &#8216;arts knowledge&#8217; with high cultural capital, rubbed up against counter-hegemonic strategies to enlist and develop more universal concepts about creativity as a collaborative endeavour, vital to new forms of capitalist enterprise. By historicising the context in which a new &#8216;normative doctrine&#8217; of creativity has emerged, and by treating its theorisation as culturally performative, I develop the position that fashion design graduates, as &#8216;creative girls&#8217;, are highly productive performers in the new categories of cultural economy. However I argue that the creative girl occupies a subject position fitted to after-neoliberalised social and economic arrangements, not because she is shaped by neoliberal ideologies, but because she is made up by techniques and tactics of an &#8216;after-neoliberal&#8217; governmentality. This demonstrates the mutual constitution of &#8216;creative economy&#8217; and &#8216;creative persons&#8217; and underlines the fact that despite after-neoliberal ambitions for managing education, there can be no simple cause and effect relation between higher education and economic performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity research</field><field name="subject">creativity pedagogy</field><field name="subject">creative economy</field><field name="subject">sociology of design</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">youth studies</field><field name="subject">governmental politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microarray-based gene set analysis in cancer studies</field><field name="creator">Song, Qin Sarah</field><field name="description">This work addresses the development and application of gene set analysis methods to problems in microarray-based data sets.

Geothermal systems are a potential source of Sb in the fresh waters of New Zealand&#8217;s North Island, but little is known about the element&#8217;s behaviour within geothermal fluids, and even less about the eventual fate of geothermally produced Sb.  The purpose of this thesis was to determine the factors controlling geothermal Sb behaviour in a range of environments, in order to begin to develop an understanding of the eventual fate of Sb produced from geothermal systems. Factors controlling Sb precipitation at two New Zealand geothermal power stations, were determined using field measurements and geochemical model predictions.  Approximately 75 % of the incoming Sb, which ranged from 960 &#8211; 1650 &#956;g/kg in the incoming fluids was removed from solution within the Ngawha and Rotokawa power stations.  It was found that changes in pH and temperature were the most important factors controlling stibnite (Sb2S3) precipitation.  Thermodynamic databases could be used to model this precipitation process, once updated with recent published Sb2S3 solubility data. The mobility of Sb from Sb2S3 precipitates in geothermal features at Wai-O-Tapu and Waimangu, two New Zealand geothermal fields, were investigated.  At Wai-O-Tapu, daytime variations in aqueous Sb concentrations from the discharge of Champagne Pool may be due to to changing sulfide-sulfate equilibria coupled with photosynthetic bacterial processes.  While daytime concentrations of Sb approached 200 &#956;g/kg, most of the Sb remobilised by such mechanisms appears to be removed by adsorption onto suspended particulate material (SPM) or reprecipitation (as Sb2S3) in an anoxic, low pH lake feature downstream. Concentrations of Sb in the discharge from Alum Lake were below the analytical detection limit (&lt;0.2 &#956;g/kg).  At Waimangu, these daytime fluctuations were not observed in the discharge of Frying Pan Lake, and concentrations of Sb were ~13 &#956;g/kg.  In the absence of any downstream acidic waters, no precipitation was observed and only minor adsorption onto SPM was observed.  Most of the Sb produced from Frying Pan Lake is therefore transported into Lake Rotomahana, the system&#8217;s receiving environment. Natural Sb removal processes in receiving (non-geothermal) environments were also assessed.  In the Waikato River, Sb concentrations were low (~1 &#956;g/kg), compared to those observed in geothermal environments studied.  The most important process was adsorption to SPM, which is enhanced at low (&lt; 5) pH conditions, or in the anoxic base of stratified lakes.  In Lake Ohakuri, which was stratified during the summer of 2007, there was also the potential for the removal of Sb as Sb2S3 in the presence of sulfide species that form in the anoxic layer.  There was evidence that the adsorption of Sb changes with changing Fe concentrations in suspended particulate material, and therefore Sb adsorption was higher in winter than in summer.  The behaviour of Sb was conservative in the Port Waikato estuary at the mouth of the river. Throughout the research, Sb was compared to arsenic (As), a metalloid previously thought to exhibit behaviour similar to Sb in aquatic environments.  It was found that while any removal processes shown to affect Sb will also affect As, the inverse did not necessarily apply.  Arsenic will adsorb more readily to SPM than Sb and, while there was evidence for bioaccumulation of As by geothermal algae and freshwater macrophytes, there was no such evidence for Sb.  Therefore, if geothermally-derived Sb and As did ever significantly contaminate a downstream environment, it should not be assumed that the processes mitigating As contamination will necessarily also apply to Sb.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">environmental chemistry</field><field name="subject">arsenic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260300 Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing the prostitute: representations of prostitution in Victorian Britain</field><field name="creator">Attwood, Nina Jean</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430109 History: British</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of coopeation: insights from experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens</field><field name="creator">Meintjes, Peter L.</field><field name="description">The field of experimental evolution is burgeoning under the power of microbial systems. Our ability to manipulate experimental design for use with microbes is only limited by our imagination. This thesis is a study that uses Pseudomonas fluorescens, a soil dwelling bacterium, as an experimental tool for understanding evolutionary processes. The evolution of cooperation has been a thorny issue for many years, because it initially seems to contradict the intrinsically selfish concepts established in Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection. Advances in microbiology and the ability to test important evolutionary theories using microbes, provides an exciting opportunity for those working in the field of experimental evolution. This thesis uses P. fluorescens to investigate four aspects of the evolution of cooperative behaviour organised into four results chapters (Chapters 2-5). The first describes the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of 26 independently derived &#8216;wrinkly spreader&#8217; genotypes in order to analyse the genetic and phenotypic variation among morphotypes. Mutations were identified in 25 of the 26 wrinkly spreaders including a new locus mws and three new genes of known loci wspE, awsR and awsO. This new genetic information provided additional insight into the molecular causes of the wrinkly spreader phenotype. Multivariate analysis of the phenotypic traits revealed that wspF mutants were phenotypically distinct from other morphotypes at a level below the ecological niche. The second chapter extended existing studies on the evolution of wrinkly spreader genotypes within the well-known Haystack model for evolution in group-structured populations, by studying the population dynamics of cooperative genotypes with and without group structure, in a multi-level selection one framework. It was shown that the time spent in a haystack affects the fitness of cooperators, because the longer group-generation treatment conformed to the predictions of the Haystack model, while the shorter group-generation treatment did not. The third chapter was an investigation into how the fitness of the emergent group-level phenotype formed by cooperating wrinkly spreader cells was dependent on the density of wrinkly spreader cells. Contrary to prediction, no density dependence was observed when calculated in a multi-level selection one framework, but rather it was determined that the emergent fitness was dependent on time, implicating a role for a development-like process. The final results chapter of this thesis incorporated the hypothesised role for a development-like process into a novel theoretical model for the evolution of multicellularity in which fitness would be determined in a multi-level selection two framework. Novel apparatus and experimental design were developed to determine if it were possible to observe a response to a selective regime that selected simultaneously at the level of the individual cell and the level of the group of cells. A significant response was shown after only six group-generation cycles. In summary, this thesis exploits P. fluorescens as an experimental tool to gain insight into complex ecological and evolutionary phenomena such as cooperation, biofilm formation and the evolution of multicellularity, and provides insight into the molecular causes of the cooperation among wrinkly spreader genotypes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biology</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Experimental evolution</field><field name="subject">Molecular Biology</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpreting references to the subject in philosophical writings</field><field name="creator">Nickless, David, M.A.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I will develop and test an interpretive framework for the Subject based on the understanding that an entity can be identified as a Subject if it is the necessary referent for an attribution.

It does not, therefore, purport to be an exhaustive study of the law of contempt in all its protean forms. Rather, its aims are to assess what the law is, and why, and to consider whether it aptly describes the values of the society it purports to protect. The law of contempt has suffered from an excess of dichotomies and classifications which nowhere guarantee its clarity. The most enduring classification is that which distinguishes between criminal and civil contempts, largely on the basis of whether the sanctions which follow are punitive or coercive. Three types of criminal contempt are discussed. Contempt in the face of the court concerns the jurisdiction to punish summarily contumelious behaviour in court. It is argued that, since the summary procedure permits the imposition of sanctions without the usual trial safeguards, the contempt power ought to be limited to the removal of the contemnor from the court. Any more extensive contempt power arguably infringes the freedoms protected by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The law of sub judice contempt seeks to strike a balance between the competing values of freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. Judicial insistence on the existence of a real risk as a matter of practical reality before the actus reus of this form of contempt is met has effectively restrained criticisms of the rule. Nevertheless, since it can penalise non-negligent practices, it is suggested that sub judice contempt should be treated as a crime of strict liability. The third form of criminal contempt, scandalising a court or judge, is said to be necessary to ensure confidence in the administration of justice. However, there is little evidence that the public perception of the judiciary would suffer through debate over the abilities of its judges. This arm of contempt ought not to be perceived as a form of judicial protectionism. For that reason, and because it arguably infringes the Bill of Rights Act 1990, it is urged that contempt through scandalising a court or judge should be abolished. The law of civil contempt is dealt with through a discussion of breaches of injunctions and undertakings. Since the sanctions which follow may serve both punitive and coercive ends the distinction between this category and the other three is regarded as incomplete. It is contended, however, that there are many similarities between criminal and civil contempts which merit their treatment as a genus. Whenever punitive sanctions are imposed (whether for a criminal or civil contempt) normal trial safeguards ought to exist. On the other hand, if enforcement of a court order is sought, such protection is inappropriate. A procedural approach to the different types of sanctions ought to rid contempt law of perplexing categorisations which fail to address the essential characteristics of the contempt power.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite element solution of an eikonal equation for excitation wavefront propagation in ventricular mycodium</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson, Karl Antony</field><field name="description">An efficient finite element method is developed to model the spreading of excitation in ventricular myocardium by treating the thin region of rapidly depolarizing tissue as a propagating wavefront. The model is used to investigate the excitation sequence in the full canine ventricular myocardium. The solution to an eikonal&#8211;curvature equation for excitation time is shown to satisfy a reaction&#8211;diffusion equation for the bidomain myocardial model at the wavefront, while the solution to an eikonal&#8211;diffusion equation approximately satisfies the reaction&#8211;diffusion equation in the vicinity of the wavefront. The features of these two eikonal equations are discussed. A Petrov&#8211;Galerkin finite element method with cubic Hermite elements is developed to solve the eikonal&#8211;diffusion equation. The oscillatory errors seen when using the Galerkin weighted residual method with high mesh P&#233;clet numbers are avoided by supplementing the Galerkin weights with C&#8304; continuous functions based on derivatives of the interpolation functions. The ratio of the Galerkin and supplementary weights is a function of the P&#233;clet number such that, for one-dimensional propagation, the error in the solution is within a small constant factor of the optimal error achievable in the trial space. An additional noinflow boundary term is developed to prevent spurious excitation initiating on the boundary. The need for discretization in time is avoided by using a continuation method to gradually introduce the non-linear term of the governing equation. A small amount of artificial diffusion is sometimes necessary. Simulations of excitation are performed using a model of the anisotropic canine ventricular myocardium with 23.55 degrees of freedom for the dependent variable, and results are compared with reported experimental observations. When it was assumed that Purkinje fibres influence propagation only on the endocardial surface, excitation of the entire myocardium was completed in 56 ms. Altering material parameters to represent penetration of the Purkinje fibres beneath the left endocardial surface reduced the completion time to 48 ms. Modelling the effects of the laminar structure of myocardium by reducing the propagation speed by 40% in the direction normal to the layers delayed completion of excitation by only 4%.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible software process model</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Diana Caroline</field><field name="description">Many different kinds of process are used to develop software intensive products, but there is little agreement as to which processes give the best results under which circumstances. Practitioners and researchers believe that project outcomes would be improved if the development process was constructed according to project-specific factors. In order to achieve this goal, greater understanding of the factors that most affect outcomes is needed. To improve understanding, researchers build models of the process and carry out studies based on these models. However, current models contain many ambiguities and assumptions, and so it is not clear what the results of the studies mean. The statement of this thesis is that it is possible to create an abstraction of the software development process that will provide a mechanism for comparing software processes and software process models. The long term goal of the research is to provide planners with a means of tailoring the development process on a project by project basis, with the aim of reducing risk and improving outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280302 Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280111 Conceptual modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and microbial transformations of some lanosterol derivatives</field><field name="creator">Bartley, John Peter</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Lapita developments in the Reef-Santa Cruz Islands, southeast Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Doherty, Moira Winifrid</field><field name="description">The Pacific is a world of islands, so human migrations are necessarily part of the story of this world. It is somewhat surprising therefore to find that there are so many points of contention among archaeologists, linguists and biologists about the role that migrations have played in producing culture change in Pacific prehistory -just how many migrations are we talking about, on what scale, by whom, and when, and which discipline provides more reliable evidence? The specifics of the debate may be local, but the substantive issues have broader applicability. This thesis attempts to contribute to the debate by considering the archaeological evidence for a hypothesised migration during the post-Lapita period of people speaking non-Austronesian languages into the Main Reef and Santa Cruz Islands in the southeast Solomon Islands. It describes the theoretical and methodological difficulties in trying to assess whether cladistic or rhizotic processes best account for culture change. Previously unpublished archaeological material from two Main Reef Islands sites is presented, and is compared with the linguistic and human biological evidence pertinent to the case study. The narratives of cross-cultural encounters during the historic period are examined to investigate how such interactions produce change in cultural traditions, and to assess the archaeological visibility of these contacts. While the archaeological record testifies to cultural borrowings and lendings in the Reef-Santa Cruz case, the argument for either large-scale population intrusion or replacement is not well supported. The archaeological record appears to be in conflict with the prevailing interpretation of history reconstructed from historical linguistics and human genetics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370301 Biological (physical) anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying the Classical Theologia Crucis and in this Light Karl Barth's Modern Theology of the Cross</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Rosalene Clare</field><field name="description">This dissertation is presented in two parts.  It first identifies the shape and content of an ancient system of Christian thought predicated on the theology of the cross of Jesus Christ, and proposes the marks typifying its theologians.  Over against the ensuing hermeneutic it next finds the project of twentieth century Swiss theologian Karl Barth to exhibit many of the defining characteristics of this system, and Barth himself to be fairly deemed a modern theologian of the cross.  He crucially recovers, reshapes and reasserts the classical theologia crucis as a modern theological instrument, one answering enlightened theology&#8217;s self-glorifying accommodation to modernity with the living Word of the cross.  The crucicentric system itself is found to comprise two major theological dimensions, epistemological and soteriological.  Each of these comprises dialectically corresponding aspects connected with false and true creaturely glory.  The cruciform Word (or theology) speaking through this system likewise moves in two directions.  It declares negatively that any attempt by the creature to circumvent the cross so as to know about God directly, or to condition God's electing decision, is necessarily the attempt to know and act as God alone may know and act - an attempt therefore on the glory of God.  It declares positively that in the crucified Christ God formally discloses the knowledge of God, and determines the creature for God.  This knowledge and election are appropriated to the creature as, drawn into the cruciform environment, its attempt to glorify itself is negated and Christ's exalted humanity received in exchange.  Thence it is lifted to participate in Christ's mind and in his glory, a process guided by the Holy Spirit and completed eschatologically.  The database for this research includes selected primary materials in the Apostle Paul, Athanasius, a group of medieval mystical theologians, the reformer Martin Luther - particularly here his Heidelberg Disputation, and Karl Barth.  It also pays attention to the recent secondary literature peripherally or more concertedly connecting itself to the theology of the cross, of whatever period.  In this literature numerous suggestions for the content of the theology of the cross exist, a major methodological task in the current research being to bring these together systematically.  To the extent that the inner structure of the system carrying the cruciform Word has not previously been made explicit, and Barth's crucicentric status not finally determined, in moving towards these achievements this dissertation breaks fresh ground.  In the process a new test by which to decide the crucicentric status of any theological project is developed, and a further and crucicentric way of reading Barth proposed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theology of the cross</field><field name="subject">theologia crucis</field><field name="subject">Kreuzestheologie</field><field name="subject">Paul, Apostle</field><field name="subject">Athanasius</field><field name="subject">Bernard of Clairvaux</field><field name="subject">Theologia Germanica</field><field name="subject">Johannes Tauler</field><field name="subject">Nicholas of Cusa</field><field name="subject">Meister Eckhart</field><field name="subject">Luther, Martin</field><field name="subject">Barth, Karl</field><field name="subject">Christology</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">soteriology</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">theology of glory</field><field name="subject">theologia gloriae</field><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="subject">modernism</field><field name="subject">Schleiermacher, Friedrich</field><field name="subject">medieval mysticism</field><field name="subject">medieval mystics</field><field name="subject">Reformation</field><field name="subject">cross</field><field name="subject">crucifixion</field><field name="subject">Jesus Christ</field><field name="subject">Jesus</field><field name="subject">Christ</field><field name="subject">Calvin, John</field><field name="subject">Cappadocian Fathers</field><field name="subject">Antony the Great</field><field name="subject">wisdom</field><field name="subject">foolishness</field><field name="subject">Heidelberg Disputation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative diversity at the major histocompatibility complex in two dolphin species</field><field name="creator">Heimeier, Dorothea</field><field name="description">This thesis presents investigations of diversity at three genes (class I, DQA and DQB) of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in cetaceans. The MHC genes encode for proteins that are crucial for initiating an immune response by binding invading pathogens in vertebrates. It has been acknowledged that a high diversity at these genes results in the ability to recognise a wider range of pathogens, therefore functional diversity is important for the survival of a species. Furthermore this diversity has been created under the influence of selection, which can reveal interesting contrasts with neutral markers about the history of selection of populations and species. The diversity at two genes (DQA and DQB) in natural populations of two contrasting species of cetaceans has been investigated in more detail. The species selected included both sub-species of Hector&#8217;s dolphin, the Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori) and the Maui&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui), as well as the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). These species were chosen, because both Hector&#8217;s dolphin sub-species contrast with the pilot whale species in regards to their population size, abundance, population structure and life history. For example both sub-species of Hector&#8217;s dolphin have small population sizes and only inhabit coastal areas around New Zealand, whereas the pilot whale is an abundant, pelagic dolphin species. In Chapter 2 the expression of class II MHC genes (DQA and DQB) was demonstrated for the first time for a cetacean species, the Hector&#8217;s dolphin. Using available information from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), I also designed primers to investigate class I MHC. Fragments of MHC genes were amplified from cDNA, which was derived from blood samples of two Hector&#8217;s dolphins. These dolphins were the subject of a temporary live capture, presenting a unique opportunity for blood collection. No evidence was found for duplication of both MHC class II loci, but cloning suggested a minimum of three copies of class I genes within the genomic DNA. However, the expression of all class I genes was uncertain, since only one allele could be isolated from cDNA. Functionality for all three genes (class I, DQA and DQB) was supported by the evidence for balancing selection having operated on these genes, indicated by a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions. In Chapter 3, a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing was used to describe DQA and DQB diversity in the Hector&#8217;s and Maui&#8217;s dolphin. Genetic samples for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin were available from previously collected stranding and biopsy samples (n = 233), representing three populations from the South Coast of New Zealand and the sub-species on the West Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. For the Hector&#8217;s dolphin of the South Island, a surprisingly large number of alleles at both loci (DQA = 4, DQB = 6) were found, considering their small population size and compared to other cetacean populations with larger population sizes. The Maui&#8217;s dolphin has been classified as critically endangered with less than 100 dolphins, but showed a relatively high nucleotide diversity for DQB (&#61552; = 4.5%). This diversity was based on only three alleles that have been retained in the sub-species, representing the most divergent of all six alleles. All populations showed strong geographic differentiation at both loci (DQA: FST=0.252; DQB: FST=0.333), with the greatest differentiation between the South Island population and the North Island Maui&#8217;s dolphin. Comparison to mitochondrial and microsatellite diversity suggested influence of stochastic genetic drift, although the pressure of balancing selection acting on DQB over an evolutionary time period was also evident by a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS=5.9) and by a pattern of trans-specific allele sharing within the family of Delphinidae. In Chapter 4 similar methods were used to describe DQA and DQB in pilot whales using genetic samples from the long-finned pilot whale that were available from five mass-strandings from around New Zealand (n = 237). A larger number of alleles than for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin were found at both loci (DQA= 8; DQB= 8), although their large population size and pelagic abundance raises the expectation of an even greater number of alleles. The overall differentiation between mass-strandings was low, but significant for both loci (DQA: FST =0.012, DQB: FST =0.014). The differentiation of all strandings was greatest for the Golden Bay mass-stranding at DQA, but deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at DQB suggested either sub-structure within mass-strandings (Wahlund effect) or the presence of null alleles. As for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin and other mammalian species, the influence of balancing selection acting on DQB over a long evolutionary time period was evident by a higher ratio non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS=9.3) and by a pattern of trans-specific allele sharing within the family of Delphinidae.  Overall, diversity is surprisingly similar between these two cetacean species despite different life history characteristic, but low compared to domesticated ungulate species, such as the cow. If low MHC diversity is a general feature of cetaceans, due to the marine environment as suggested previously or rather a side effect of short-term demographic forces remains speculative. A standardised nomenclature for the increasing number of MHC alleles from cetacean is proposed in this thesis to assist with future development of this research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MHC</field><field name="subject">Maui's dolphin</field><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">long-finned pilot whale</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">expression of MHC genes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Here &amp; now: intimacy, immediacy and authenticity in New Zealand's reality television</field><field name="creator">West, Amy</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This thesis analyses a range of reality television programmes produced in New Zealand as part of a wider investigation into the affective strategies and discursive practices of the medium of television itself. The capacity of television, and more specifically reality television, to bring things close and render them present - spatially, temporally, socially and emotionally &#8211; is the thematic fulcrum of this study. Closeness is variously interpreted here as proximity (in terms of space, geography or social position), co-incidence (in terms of time) and intimacy (in terms of emotional affect). The present-ness of reality programming is both temporal (occurring now, in the present tense) and physical (occurring here, in this body, in this home, in this country). It is through this affect of present-ness that reality television most clearly engages with the domain of the real. Thus, this study also turns upon a consideration of the various significant ways in which reality television defines, pursues and manifests moments of realness on screen. The thesis is broken down into two parts, entitled Here and Now respectively, reflecting the double axis of spatial (incorporating social) and temporal present-ness. Within this bi-partite structure, six chapters focus in turn on a number of different discursive threads: Viscerality, Ordinariness, Community, Amateurism, Intimacy and Temporal Immediacy, producing a cumulative theoretical framework through which to address reality TV. In terms of methodology, this thesis pursues its exploration of reality television through close textual readings of selected programmes which have been produced for a New Zealand audience. Where appropriate, however, it draws on international examples of reality programming, in particular, those high-profile formats from Europe and the United States which have generated new paradigms for the production and reception of reality television worldwide. In addition, this thesis analyses programme form and content through a range of theoretical frameworks drawn from television studies and other academic disciplines. It also seeks to engage with international critical and academic debates surrounding the often controversial rise of reality programming as a televisual phenomenon in the nineties and into the twenty-first century. The production of this thesis coincides with a surge in academic output on the subject of reality television, and has benefited from recent publications in this area. This thesis attempts to balance both general and specific interests in New Zealand&#8217;s reality programming. On one hand, it places reality television within the context of long-established, international academic discussions about television as a medium, with the intent of showing that reality programming has an innate applicability to the domestic medium out of which it has arisen. On the other, this thesis pursues a more specific project, as it considers locally-produced programming as the particular output of the island nation of New Zealand. In this case, I argue that the particular aesthetic and discursive practices of reality programming, which devolve upon the ordinary, the domestic and the local, are well-suited to the ongoing production of culture and identity in a settler nation such as New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television</field><field name="subject">reality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecstatic display call of the Ad&#233;lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)</field><field name="creator">Marks, Emma Josephine</field><field name="description">The ability to understand the complex mechanisms by which species communicate has been the focus of study for many years. The Ad&#233;lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeds in vocally challenging Antarctic colonies and has evolved a complex system of intra- and intersexual visual and vocal behaviours. Unique to the Ad&#233;lie penguin, is the presence of two distinct display calls, the Loud Mutual Display (LMD) call and male Ecstatic Display Call (EDC). The EDC is used for both mate choice and territory defence; but apart from general structure and function this call remains basically unstudied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the EDC with regard to its function (during mate choice) and variability over time, with location and with changing conditions. It is predicted that the EDC will be an individual call that is distinct from the LMD call. Additionally, the effects of an inclement breeding season on factors that affect breeding success will be examined using a logistic regression approach. The study took place over two breeding seasons(2000/1 &amp; 2002/3) on Ross Island, Antarctica, with the majority of research being conducted at Cape Bird. Results of the study indicate that the EDC is an individual call that cannot reliably be described as a male display as females also give an EDC that is acoustically comparable. The similarities between the EDC and the LMD call seem to relate only to syllabic organisation (structure), as almost every call parameter was different between call types. Furthermore, several call parameters differed between Ross Island colonies. These parameters varied with both geographical location and colony size. In conjunction with variation in call parameters, the health and breeding success of the colonies was different. The stability of call parameters (from Cape Bird) indicated that parameters that separate colonies not only alter between breeding years, but also vary during a single breeding season. The function of the EDC as an honest signal during mate choice was supported by spectral analyses. These analyses found heavier males had significantly lower Frequency Modulation (FM) in the short repeated syllables of their calls than lighter males. Furthermore, a male&#8217;s breeding success could be predicted during the early breeding season by the FM. Logistic regression models showed that early male arrival, weight and good nest quality were most influential in predicting fledging success. The logistic regression method also showed that the parameters measured varied in their predictive ability as the season progressed. This study has not only enhanced the wealth of knowledge regarding Ad&#233;lie breeding behaviour and developed our understanding of the vocal repertoire of this species, but also has implications for honest signalling theory, and the evolution and stability of vocal variation at different spatial and temporal scales.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adelie penguin</field><field name="subject">Ecstatic Display Call</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">breeding success</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species recognition in zebra finches: testing the effects of sex, sensory modalities, and social ontogeny</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Dana L.M.</field><field name="description">Species recognition is an integral component of mate selection and must occur in all sexually reproducing organisms to avoid costly hybridisation. Species recognition abilities may be comprised of both innate components and experience during ontogeny through the learning of visual, acoustic, and other sensory species-specific cues.

Using a model system, which is widely studied in all disciplines of avian research, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis), I aimed to investigate the visual and acoustic cues involved in conspecific recognition by both female and male individuals of this species. I used an array of previously untested phylogeographically relevant estrildid heterospecifics as my stimuli and tested subjects of diverse experimental ontogenetic treatments. By scoring a wide-selection of measured behavioural responses my research indicates that female and male zebra finches prefer live conspecifics over live phylogeographically relevant heterospecific stimuli and this preference is more consistent by females than males. Female zebra finches rely on both visual and acoustic features of potential social partners for accurate species discrimination; in this regard video playbacks or the diverse colour morphs of domesticated zebra finches may be useful tools for further experimentation. Additionally, females display significant individuality in their behavioural responses which may be relevant for pair bonding decisions made by both sexes. I further documented that normally-reared zebra finches will prefer song playbacks of their own species but that both rearing in an indoor restricted acoustic environment of conspecifics or cross-fostering to another species will reduce discrimination preferences, although the results may depend on the behavioural metrics analysed. This dissertation is presented as a general overview with details of my specific contributions towards the work included in this thesis, followed by discrete review and data chapters, and a final general discussion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of seismic damage to civil structures using statistical pattern recognition techniques and time series analysis</field><field name="creator">de Lautour, Oliver R.</field><field name="description">The ability to estimate seismic induced damage to civil infrastructure is undoubtedly one of the most important challenges faced by structural engineers. In this research two complementary methods of damage estimation using either knowledge of the structure and earthquake or recorded structural responses were investigated. These methods gave different natured estimates, either prediction or detection, which are suitable for different applications. Firstly, damage to a structure was predicted based on analysis of structural and ground motion properties. Secondly, damage to a structure was detected and assessed by analysing the structural response under dynamic excitation. In the first approach, basic structural and ground motion properties were used to characterise a broad group of structures and earthquakes. These properties were used as inputs into a Back-Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and related to a damage index that quantified the extent of damage to the structure. A set of prior structural analyses was required to train the ANN before useful predictions could be made. Applied to 2D Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames, the method was capable of predicting with good accuracy damage to frames of varying stiffness, strength and topology whilst subjected to a range of ground motion severities. In the second approach, Autoregressive (AR) models were used to fit the acceleration time histories obtained when the structure was in both undamaged and damaged states. The AR coefficients were selected as damage sensitive features and statistical pattern recognition techniques were investigated for interpreting changes in the values of these features caused by damage. Initially, an offline damage detection method was developed in which BP ANNs were used for both classification and quantification tasks where the percentage remaining stiffness at a specific location was estimated. The method was applied to three experimental structures; a 3-storey bookshelf structure, the ASCE Phase II Experimental SHM Benchmark Structure and a RC column. In addition, for damage classification tasks only, the supervised classification techniques of Nearest Neighbour and Learning Vector Quantisation were found to be effective while Self-Organising Maps, an unsupervised classification method, showed promising results. Finally, an online damage detection method was developed based on recursive identification of the AR models using the forgetting factor and Kalman filter approaches. A linear 3-DOF model with time varying stiffness was investigated and the results showed that damage could be detected and quantified as it occurred. Nonlinear damage detection was addressed with the investigation of a 1-DOF bilinear oscillator and a 3- DOF Bouc-Wen hysteretic system. In both cases the on-set of nonlinearity was detected using Outlier analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raman scattering and four-wave mixing: from fundamentals to fibre lasers</field><field name="creator">Schr&#246;der, Jochen, 1976-</field><field name="description">Ramanscattering and four-wave mixing are two fundamental nonlinear phenomena present in optical fibres with important implications for applications in fields ranging from modern telecommunications networks to biophotonics. This thesis investigates three situations when these two phenomena interact: Firstly we investigate the interplay of multiple four-wave mixing processes using coherent and incoherent pump waves in the presence of Raman scattering. We experimentally demonstrate that despite the requirements of phase-matching conditions it is possible to observe multiple phasematched and non-phasematched four-wave mixing processes. Furthermore we show that an incoherent light wave provided by amplified spontaneous emission noise can act as an effective pump wave for degenerate four-wave mixing. The main part of the thesis is occupied by the investigation of a mode-locked Raman fibre laser. The use of dissipative four-wave mixing for the passive mode-locking technique in combination with Raman scattering as the gain mechanism offers the possibility of achieving ultra-high repetition rates at very high average output powers. We experimentally demonstrate the mode-locked operation of the laser at 500 GHz and achieve an average output power of almost 1 W. Additionally we examine the key limitation of the laser which is supermode noise caused by mode-locking the laser at very high harmonics of the cavity resonance frequency. In order to gain qualitative insight into the influence of supermode noise on the laser dynamics we create a laser model which takes account of supermode noise. Furthermore we design a scheme to reduce supermode noise using additional subcavities, and evaluate the scheme using a lower repetition rate laser. We show that by including the subcavities into the setup the amount of supermode noise can be reduced by at least a factor 100. Lastly we introduce a novel method to measure the noise fluctuations of continuous wave lasers at timescales prohibiting the use of traditional noise measurement techniques. The noise is measured using a technique which transfers the fast noise from the continuous wave laser to a low repetition rate mode-locked laser which can be measured with traditional methods. We demonstrate that a continuous wave Raman fibre laser exhibits ultrafast, high contrast intensity fluctuations at timescales of tens of Gigahertz. This work has led to three publications and six conference presentations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical trial simulation: disease progression and treatment modifications in Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Chan, Phylinda Lai Sim</field><field name="description">Clinical trial simulation (CTS) and modelling are techniques which play an important role in clinical pharmacology and drug development. The goal of this thesis is to apply techniques in CTS and modelling for studying disease progression and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Three components of levodopa response can be identified in patients with Parkinson's disease; a transient short-duration response, a sustained long-duration response to exogenous levodopa, and diurnally varying endogenous levodopa synthesis. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe the individual components of levodopa response. Twenty-one previously untreated (de novo) patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients who had received levodopa orally for 9.7 &#177; 4.0 years were investigated. Twenty de novo patients were examined at 6, 12, 24 and 48 months. No systematic changes in levodopa pharmacokinetics were found in the first 4 years of long-term levodopa treatment. A lowered baseline motor response and an increase in efficacy with time result in an exaggerated short-duration response which might be key contributors to the development of motor fluctuations with long-term levodopa treatment. The capability of CTS to generate typical responses was evaluated. If progression rate of bradykinesia is influenced by age then it should be possible to detect this effect using reasonable clinical trial designs. The ELLDOPA trial aims to determine if levodopa slows or accelerates the rate of disease progression of Parkinson's disease. The power of the ELLDOPA trial design was evaluated using a clinical pharmacology model. The simulation results suggested that the short washout period for levodopa symptomatic effect could lead to a false conclusion about the nature of the levodopa treatment effect. This thesis has shown that pharmacodynamic or disease progression factors rather than pharmacokinetic changes are responsible for the development of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. It has quantified the unexpected development of increased efficacy of levodopa over time. Clinical trials designed to evaluate disease progression without recognising washout of the long-duration response of levodopa can lead to misinterpretation of trial outcomes. However, model based approaches can disentangle these confounding factors and dissect the underlying effects of drug action on disease progression.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of an Online English learning program</field><field name="creator">Ho, Yi-Chieh</field><field name="description">Along with the rapid growth of computer technology, the need for CALL evaluation has become increasingly important; however, its implementation remains problematic for a number of reasons including teachers&#8217; lack of experience and adequate skills (Hubbard, 2006), lack of mutually agreed-upon adequate criteria (Hubbard, 2006), and lack of higher-level evaluative skills to evaluate media online (Oosterhof, Conrad, &amp; Ely, 2008). This study describes the classroom-based evaluation of a CALL program. It was undertaken in a Taiwan technological institute, with participants (N = 39) from second-year night-time junior college. The aims were to evaluate the effectiveness of the English Discoveries Online (EDO) program, to identify changes for more effective future use and sound criteria for CALL evaluation. The program&#8217;s key features include self-directed courses, self-access out of class, regularly updated materials delivered through the Internet, Web-literacy development, the Teacher Management System, and support tools. Effectiveness was determined by examining self-access learning out of class, motivation, Web-literacy, English proficiency, and the above key features. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The evaluation followed Alderson&#8217;s (1992) framework for planning, Weir and Roberts (1994) for design and implementation, and Ellis&#8217; (1997a &amp; b) three types of evaluation for data collection. Instruments included: questionnaires, checklists, an observation record of student behaviors, a monitoring record of the computer screens, reports, individual student records on self-access, and student e-mails sent to the teacher-researcher. The results showed that students considered the EDO helpful for learning English, for enhancing their computer knowledge and English learning interest out of class. There was no significant change in students&#8217; motivation and Web-literacy. There was a significant improvement in students&#8217; pre- and post-test scores in reading and writing. More positive rather than negative comments were given about the key features of the program in students&#8217; reports. Overall, 91% of the class considered the program effective. The findings indicate that this program has a place in English teaching in this Taiwan context. Implications and limitations, as well as lessons learned as a teacher and an evaluator, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuronal changes in the cerebral cortex of human brain in Huntington&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Thu, Doris C. V.</field><field name="description">Huntington's disease (HD) is characterised by a major loss of neurons mainly in the basal ganglia but recent evidence by Macdonald and Halliday (2002) and others have shown that the cerebral cortex is also affected. In this study, neuronal changes in the primary motor cortex (Brodmann's area 4), primary sensory cortex (Brodmann's area 3), anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann's area 24) and superior frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 8) were investigated in 16 HD cases and 15 age, sex and postmortem-delay matched normal cases. Immunohistochemical techniques and light microscopy were used to compare the pattern of neuronal loss between the normal and HD cortices. The total neuronal population (NeuN) and pyramidal subpopulation (SMI32) in a subvolume of specific Brodmann's areas were investigated using unbiased stereological counting techniques. The results demonstrated a marked neuronal reduction in these cortical regions in HD compared to normal cases, and this reduction was greater as the "striatal" neuropathological grade increased in the primary motor and primary sensory cortex. However, in the anterior cingulate and superior frontal cortex, marked reduction was also demonstrated in the early grade cases. Despite this, there is also a large variation in the pattern of cell loss between HD cases of the same neuropathological grade, prompting the hypothesis that other factors may be influencing the extent of cell degeneration. To investigate this, the HD cases in this study were grouped into "mainly motor", "mainly mood" and "mixed" symptomatology groups. The results have shown that regardless of their striatal neuropathological grade, the pattern of cell loss in the cerebral cortex is correlated to the various clinical symptomatologies of HD. Another major finding is the demonstration of marked dystrophic changes in the remaining pyramidal neurons in HD cortex, suggesting major ongoing neuronal dysfunction. In addition, cortical interneurons (calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin) are also shown to be affected in HD. These overall findings, together with the demonstration that there is no statistically significant correlation between the extent of neuronal cell death in the cortex and the CAG expansion number in the HD IT15 gene, show that HD is a heterogeneous disease where the pattern of cell loss in the cerebral cortex is as variable as the pattern of symptomatology. These findings provide a major contribution to the scientific understanding of the pathogenesis of HD in the human brain.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic potential of neural progenitor cell transplantation in a rat model of Huntington&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Vazey, Elena Maria</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural progenitor cells</field><field name="subject">Cell transplantation</field><field name="subject">Huntington's disease</field><field name="subject">Lithium chloride</field><field name="subject">hESC</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative continuity feature for preterm neonatal EEG signal analysis</field><field name="creator">Wong, Lisa, 1968-</field><field name="description">Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrical signal recorded from a person's scalp, and is used to monitor the neurological state of the patient. This thesis proposes a quantified continuity feature to aid preterm neonatal EEG analysis. The continuity of EEG signals for preterm infants refers to the variation of the EEG amplitude, and is affected by the conceptional age of the infants. Currently, the continuity of the signal is determined largely by visual examination of the raw EEG signal, or by using general guidelines on amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is a compressed plot of the estimated signal envelope. The proposed parametric feature embodies the statistical distribution parameters of the signal amplitudes. The signal is first segmented into pseudo-stationary segments using Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR). These segments are used to construct a vector of amplitude, the distribution of which can be modelled using a log-normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of the log-normal distribution are used as the continuity feature. This feature is less prone to the effects of local transient activities than the aEEG. This investigation has demonstrated that the degree of continuity corresponds to the major axis of the feature distribution in the feature space, and the minor axis roughly corresponds to the age of the infants in healthy files. Principal component analysis was performed on the feature, with the first coefficient used as a continuity index and the second coefficient as a maturation index. In this research, classifiers were developed to use the continuity feature to produce a qualitative continuity label. It was found that using a linear discriminant analysis based classifier, labelled data can be used as training data to produce labels consistent across all recordings. It was also found that unsupervised classifiers can assist in identifying the intrinsic clusters occurring in the recordings.  It was concluded that the proposed continuity feature can be used to aid further research in neonatal EEG analysis. Further work should focus on using the continuity information to provide a context for further feature extraction and analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women writing trauma : an analysis of psychological trauma in Ingeborg Bachmann's Das Buch Franza, Christa Wolf's Kassandra, Patricia Grace's Cousins, and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku's Ruahine - mythic women</field><field name="creator">Allport, Tanya</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore how women express psychological trauma through the writing of fiction. By analysing the historical context of what psychological trauma has meant to women, and how they have represented it, the thesis proposes a model which is based on the recurrent sources of trauma for women, the &#8216;triple trauma&#8217; of othering, violence, and voicelessness. By using cross-cultural examples from the writing of Austrian Ingeborg Bachmann, German writer Christa Wolf, and the New Zealand M&#257;ori writers Patricia Grace and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, questions are asked about the similarities and differences of how psychological trauma is represented through fiction, and what this means for the female protagonists of the texts, the female writers, readers and the cultures and societies out of which these writings originate. In analysing these relations, this thesis finds that the fictional writing about the sources and experiences of trauma can expose a range of ideological connections, and that the writing and reading about these connections constitutes a valid trauma discourse. This trauma discourse supports the aim of contemporary feminist traumatology which is to make women&#8217;s trauma visible, give meaning to it, and ultimately create frameworks that promote the healing (and prevention) of trauma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation mechanisms and development of silicon carbide refractories</field><field name="creator">Etzion, Ron</field><field name="description">The lifetime of aluminium reduction cells is of considerable importance in the operating economics of an aluminium smelter. Not only are the cell materials costly, but cell life is also key in minimizing production downtime and the waste material generated in the cutting-out and relining of a reduction cell.  This lifetime is increasingly driven by two components of the cell lining: the carbon cathode and the sidewall refractories which are the primary containment of the metal and electrolyte.  Silicon nitride bonded silicon carbide (SNBSC) refractories are the current state-of-the-art sidewall materials. These materials are formed by encapsulation of SiC particles in a silicon nitride matrix, by nitridation of silicon at high temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere.  In this study the mechanisms of the corrosion of silicon nitride bonded silicon carbide refractories in an aluminium reduction cell environment were examined.  Microstructural analysis of SNBSC materials by: X-ray diffraction, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and SEM, identified variations in &#945;/&#946; Si3N4 ratio and porosity in the binder phase, with higher porosity levels and &#946; Si3N4 content found in the interior part of the brick. Unreacted metallic silicon was observed only as a crystalline phase inside SiC grains and is not associated with the binder phase.  SNBSC samples from eight different commercial refractory manufacturers were tested in an industrial aluminium cell environment, both by immersion in industrial cells and in the laboratory.  The samples showed extensive attack and considerable differentiation between the samples.  The effects on the corrosion rate of porosity levels, amount of binder, &#945;/&#946; Si3N4 ratio, free Si content in the binder, and different factors in the environment were examined in the laboratory scale trials. A laboratory scale testing rig with some novel features, such as a rotating anode, was developed to examine corrosion resistance of samples under electrolysis conditions in molten cryolite at up to 1000oC.  Corrosion test results, supported by thermodynamic calculations, identified the Si3N4 binder as the reactive phase in SNBSC materials, especially in the gas phase above the bath level. High porosity levels and high &#946; Si3N4 fraction in the binder showed a statistically significant contribution to the corrosion rate in lab-scale corrosion trials. Commercial materials are also highly inhomogeneous in the distribution of the &#946; Si3N4 phase as mentioned above, which complicates sample selection and the interpretation of corrosion test results.   The crystal morphology of &#946; Si3N4 is suggested as the reason for the high reactivity of these materials. This morphology characterised by elongated rod-like shape crystals with hexagonal cross section, presents a higher surface area compared to &#945; Si3N4 crystals containing mainly flat matte crystals. In the light of this observation, the binder phase in selected samples was deliberately modified to convert a significant fraction of the &#945; Si3N4 to &#946; Si3N4. Corrosion rates measured from these modified samples in general support the argument that the crystallographic form of silicon nitride contributes to corrosion rate. The proposed corrosion mechanism for SNBSC materials in the aluminium reduction cell atmosphere is based on combination of oxidation of the binder followed by attack of corrosive gases to produce volatile SiF4.  Thus the binder phase is initially passivated below the electrolyte level on the sidewall, where exposure to corrosive gases is limited, but occurs more rapidly in the area above the electrolyte/air interface.  The intrusion of electrolyte into the refractory and capillary transport up the sidewall is a key in accelerating this reaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium</field><field name="subject">SiC refractories, Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similariton compression in a comb-like dispersion decreasing fibre</field><field name="creator">Im, Sung-Hoon</field><field name="description">Optical pulse compression using similariton propagation in an optical fibre with decreasing dispersion has been demonstrated for the first time. This compression scheme is a practical application of the sech-similariton solution to the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) with distributed coefficients recently found using the self-similarity technique. The sech-similariton solution exhibits a characteristic positive linear frequency chirp, which increases in slope as the pulse compresses. The solution does not develop any side pedestals or deformation in pulse shape as it propagates, making it a promising candidate for a new compression technique. Unlike the adiabatic compression technique, rapid compression can be achieved in a fibre with a specifically designed decreasing group velocity dispersion profile since the sech-similariton is an exact solution to the NLSE. A cost-effective and efficient method of realising decreasing dispersion in a fibre has been developed using a comb-like dispersion profiling technique and its feasibility has been experimentally demonstrated. An optimised experimental similariton compressor system has been built using two industry standard fibres which compressed an 11 ps linearly chirped sech input pulse to 400 fs, yielding a compression factor of greater than 25.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A methodology for business processes identification: developing instruments for an effective enterprise system project</field><field name="creator">Berkowitz, Zeev</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Mana o Te Waimana Tuhoe history of the Tauranga valley</field><field name="creator">Sissons, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">This study is an interpretation of history related by T&#363;hoe historians of the Tauranga valley, a valley situated on the northern side of the Urewera ranges, North Island, New Zealand. It is also an interpretation of historical records relating to the Tauranga valley T&#363;hoe community. Fieldwork for the study was carried out between November 1977 and July 1978, and between November 1978 and May 1979. It is argued that T&#363;hoe history of the Tauranga valley comprises four separate, but connected, domains of discourse. The first domain considered includes narratives which link tribes and sub-tribes, and relate them to their land. The second concerns relationships between local wh&#257;nau, extended families descended from grand-parents of elders now living. Accounts which comprise the third domain focus upon the identity of Rua Kenana, a T&#363;hoe leader who, with his people the Iharaira (or Israelites), established a &#8216;city of God&#8217; at Maungap&#333;hatu (at the source of the Tauranga river). The fourth domain is that of reminiscence. Three Tauranga valley settlements are described by four Iharaira elders; Tataiahape between 1909 and 1915, Matah&#299; between 1915 and 1927, and T&#257;whana in the late 1920s and 1930s. In order to highlight and explore distinctions between T&#363;hoe history and Western history, T&#363;hoe accounts are not integrated with documentary sources into a single narrative. The focus is upon T&#363;hoe history and documents are drawn upon where relevant to an understanding of this history as a distinctive mode of discourse.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A design framework and genetic algorithm for digital design optimisation on FPGAs</field><field name="creator">Savage, Matthew James Waipurukuma.</field><field name="description">Design tools of ever increasing power are required to keep pace with technological improvements in chip production. Chip capacities continually increase meaning that designs previously unfeasible become feasible. These designs are typically more complex and larger than their predecessors. Usually, the time available to a designer does not increase at the same rate. A designer is therefore tasked with a greater work load and a very limited amount of time. Design tools and automation are therefore necessary to compensate for this situation. The limiting characteristics of a design tool are its ease of use, the range of systems it can be applied to, and the quality of results obtained. Should a design tool lack in any of these three areas it will be of limited benefit. This work addresses only the quality of results obtained. While the other two are essential, they are unlikely to be relevant to a design tool if that tool is not adopted because the results were of insufficient quality. A design framework is proposed for the digital design of systems on FPGAs. This framework sets out the processes for producing a system specification of the design problem encountered, and then gives a procedure for processing that specification to produce a set of pareto-optimal designs in VHDL to implement the specification. The actual mapping of a specification to a VHDL design, is held in a mapping string that allows optimisation to be separated from other stages in the design framework. A new genetic algorithm, the Adaptive Speciation Genetic Algorithm (ASGA), is proposed featuring a customised selection, crossover, and mutation operator. This algorithm is assessed against other genetic algorithms from the literature on a knapsack problem and three digital design case studies. These case studies were the design of a parameter estimation circuit for a Self-Tuning Regulator (STR), the design of a Sum-of-Absolute- Difference (SAD) function for video motion detection problems, and the design of a five state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Results indicated that ASGA had good performance in all these problems. Through tests against other genetic algorithms, it was found the ASGA&#8217;s selection operator was inferior in some cases to that of the Pareto Envelope Selection Algorithm (PESA) by 3 Corne et al. By incorporating the selection operator of PESA performance improvements could be gained in the EKF problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">digital design</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Involvement of the osteoblast in Paget's disease of bone</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Brya Grace</field><field name="description">Paget&#8217;s disease is characterised by focal regions of accelerated bone turnover. The aetiology is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Pagetic lesions contain increased numbers of osteoclasts with abnormal morphology, so an osteoclast defect has been considered central to the pathogenesis. However, given osteoblasts regulate osteoclast differentiation and activity; osteoblast abnormalities may be important in the disease. This study aimed to identify features of pagetic osteoblasts that could clarify their role in Paget&#8217;s disease. Gene expression in osteoblasts and bone marrow cultured from pagetic lesions of 23 patients was compared to cells from unaffected tissue using both microarrays and real time RT-PCR. The results indicated global changes in gene expression in pagetic osteoblasts. A number of genes that can stimulate osteoclastogenesis, including interleukins 6 and 1&#946;, and monocyte chemotactic factor 1 were up-regulated, but the RANKL/OPG ratio tended to be decreased. Genes involved in osteoblast differentiation were down-regulated, including the transcription factors RUNX2, DLX5 and SATB2, the osteogenic factor BMP2, and the matrix proteins osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. Markers of less mature osteoblastic cells, alkaline phosphatase and matrix gla protein were up-regulated. The intermediate filament, keratin 18, was very significantly up-regulated in pagetic cells. Over-expression of this protein in osteoblasts using an adenoviral vector produced some changes in gene expression, but did not produce an overtly pagetic phenotype. Over-expression of SQSTM1 mutants found in some patients with Paget&#8217;s disease also produced only minor changes in osteoblast phenotype. The RNA from the primary cell cultures was also used to investigate the presence of measles virus and somatic mutations in SQSTM1 in the disease, but neither were identified in any of the patients.  These results suggest that there are important changes in pagetic osteoblasts that are maintained when the cells are removed from the affected bone microenvironment. These include enhanced production of factors to stimulate osteoclastogenesis, while osteoblast differentiation and activity may be impaired. We were unable to identify genetic or environmental factors that could trigger these changes. The pagetic osteoblast is distinct from control cells, and is likely to contribute to the development of Paget&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paget's disease</field><field name="subject">osteoblast</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and measuring flow in aortic stenosis with MRI</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Kieran Robert</field><field name="description">In patients with aortic stenosis, accurate assessment of severity with echocardiography is central to surgical decision making. But, when image quality is poor or equivocal results obtained, another robust non-invasive technique would be invaluable. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may be a useful alternative. Phase contrast CMR can measure  ow and velocity, therefore it is theoretically possible to estimate the main determinant of severity aortic valve area, using the continuity approach. However, it was found that the phase contrast estimate of stroke volume, sampled in the stenotic jet, systematically underestimated left ventricular stroke volume. This underestimation was greater with increasing aortic stenosis severity. Critical clinical treatment decisions depend on the ability to reliably differentiate between patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis. To achieve accurate estimation of aortic valve areas the velocity and  ow data obtained in these turbulent, high velocity jets must be accurate. In this thesis, non-stenotic and stenotic phantoms were designed and constructed to experimentally interrogate the error. It was determined that signal loss, due to intravoxel dephasing, decreased the reliability of the measured forward  ow jet velocities. Extreme signal loss in the jet eventuated in salt and pepper noise, which, with a mean velocity of zero, resulted in the underestimation. Intravoxel dephasing signal loss due to higher order motions, turbulence and spin mixing could all be mitigated by reducing the duration of the velocity sensitivity gradients and shortening the overall echo time (TE). However, improvements in an optimised PC sequence (TE 1:5ms) were not satisfactory. Flow estimates remained variable and were underestimated beyond the aortic valve. To reduce the TE further, a new phase contrast pulse sequence based on an ultrashort TE readout trajectory and velocity dependent slice excitation with gradient inversion was designed and implemented. The new sequence's TE is approximately 25% (0:65ms) of what is currently clinically available (TE 2:8ms). Good agreement in the phantom was maintained up to very high  ow rates with improved signal characteristics shown in-vivo. This new phase contrast pulse sequence is worthy of further investigation as an accurate evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic Resonace Imaging</field><field name="subject">Aortic stenosis</field><field name="subject">Phase contrast</field><field name="subject">turbulent jets</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiraling Subversions: The Politics of M&#257;ori Cultural Survivance in the Critical Fictions of Patricia Grace, Paula Morris, and Kelly Ana Morey</field><field name="creator">Pistacchi, Ann Katherine</field><field name="description">The principal objective of this doctoral research is to examine the ways in which key contemporary (2000-2005) fictional writings by M&#257;ori women authors Patricia Grace, Paula Morris, and Kelly Ana Morey demonstrate &#8220;survivance&#8221; &#8211; a term used by University of New Mexico Professor Gerald Vizenor and Ohio State University Professor Chadwick Allen to refer to the ways in which indigenous authors use their texts as &#8220;a means of cultural survival that comes with denying authoritative representations of [indigenous peoples] in addition to developing an adaptable, dynamic identity that can mediate between conflicting cultures&#8221; (Allen &#8220;Thesis&#8221; 65). I argue that acts of M&#257;ori cultural survivance are manifested in the works of these three authors both internally, in terms of the actions of characters in their fictional narratives, and externally, by the authors themselves who fight for survivance in a literary publishing world that is often slow to recognize and value works of fiction that challenge traditional (Western) modes of novel form and style. Thesis chapters therefore include both extensive critical readings of Grace&#8217;s novel Dogside Story (2001), Morris&#8217;s novels Queen of Beauty (2002) and Hibiscus Coast (2005), and Morey&#8217;s novel Bloom (2003) as well as detailed biographical information based on my interviews with the authors themselves. The thesis emphasizes the ways in which each woman&#8217;s approach to writing survivance fiction is largely driven by her personal history and whakapapa. The study also asserts that Grace, Morris and Morey are producing acts of indigenous literary cultural survivance that &#8220;imagine the world healthy,&#8221; something author and critic Maxine Hong Kingston demands that contemporary writers of critical fictions must do if they are going to convince the book-buying populace &#8220;not to worship tragedy as the highest art anymore&#8221; (204). Grace, Morris, and Morey depict the creative, generative, and &#8220;healthy&#8221; aspects of M&#257;ori cultural survivance as taking place in both the real and imagined communities which they live in and write about. Their texts offer hope for the ongoing survival &#8211; and survivance &#8211; of M&#257;ori culture in the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori Literature</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Literature</field><field name="subject">Women's Literature</field><field name="subject">Pacific Literature</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420203 Literatures of the Pacific</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420202 Maori literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"At school I&#8217;ve got a chance...": social reproduction in a New Zealand secondary school</field><field name="creator">Jones, Alison</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the contemporary debate within Western radical sociology of education regarding the relationship between the social order and the processes of schooling. It is theoretically well-established in this field that schooling is central to the maintenance of existing social relations of dominance and subordination. Focusing on the commonsense knowledge and classroom practices of two groups of fifth form adolescent girls in an inner-city all-girls Grammar school in New Zealand, the study sets out to analyse and illustrate in concrete detail some of the ideological and pedagogical processes through which schooling contributes to social reproduction. The data and discussion provide insights into the thoughts and everyday school experiences of some middle class Pakeha (European) and working class Pacific Island girls as they seriously attempt to 'get school knowledge' and, thus, the credentials which they believe the school offers the motivated and able. It also shows how teachers unwittingly recruit the active participation of students from 'race' and class groups in pedagogical interactions which often preclude the working class Pacific Island girls from acquiring the school credentials they seek. This process, and that of the school's 'provision' of the middle class Pakeha girls' academic achievement, is then 'misrecognised' by the students as the natural and fair outcome of differential talent and motivation. The theoretical framework of the thesis centres around the major contemporary questions in social theory regarding the agency-structure relationship and how social and cultural life is to be conceptualised as the dialectical product of human agents producing and produced by the social structure within which they exist.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feedback for learning: deconstructing teachers' conceptions and use of feedback</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Helen</field><field name="description">Cognisant of the critical interplay between beliefs and practice, the current study investigated primary school teachers' beliefs and understandings about feedback, and the use of feedback to enhance student learning. Central to the investigation has been an exploration of teachers' beliefs about the nature and place of feedback in student learning and of their role and that of learners in the feedback process. Of equal importance has been an examination of the strategies and practices that teachers utilised and ascribed importance to within the feedback process, including the opportunities offered to students in relation to the development of evaluative and productive knowledge and expertise (Sadler, 1989). To facilitate this investigation, Sadler's (1989) theory of formative assessment and feedback was used as a framework to inform both the research design and subsequent analyses. Utilising an interpretive, qualitative, case study methodology the current research was conducted in two sequential phases. Phase one consisted of semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 20 experienced teachers. In phase two, three of these 20 participants were selected purposively for classroom observations of teachers' feedback practice during the teaching of a written language unit. These teachers also participated in a semi-structured interview following each series of observations. During both phases, additional data were generated through field notes and the collection of relevant artefacts. Together, the multiple forms of evidence provided complementary information and ensured a rich pool of data. Three recognised approaches to data analysis were utilised, namely thematic analysis, the constant comparison method and discourse analysis. The use of Sadler's theoretical framework illuminated both similarities and differences among teachers in regard to the nature, place and role of feedback in learning and teaching. As teachers' feedback discourse was examined in more detail the influence of efficacy beliefs on the uptake and enactment of new ideas and practices associated with formative assessment and feedback became apparent. Teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning were a further mediating influence, particularly in regard to how the feedback process was conceived and with respect to the norms of behaviour that teachers promoted within the feedback process. The complexity of the beliefs/practice nexus was highlighted in regard to the influence of teachers' tacit, at times outmoded beliefs, on practice. Observations revealed that each of the three case study teachers had adopted many of the strategies associated with contemporary notions of good feedback practice. However, the ways in which these strategies were implemented in the classroom was a matter of considerable variation particularly in regard to the nature of student involvement and the amount of control maintained by the teacher. Findings from this phase of the research supported Fang's (1996) consistency/inconsistency thesis. In two of the three cases there was a high degree of consistency between teachers' stated intentions and their actions while in the third the opposite was apparent. Overall, it was concluded that while all teachers had adopted elements of the contemporary feedback 'discourse' none had mastered the 'Discourse' (Gee, 1996). Looking to the future, it is argued that this Discourse cannot be enacted through the mere bolting on of strategies to existing classroom programmes. To enact the contemporary Discourse in the ways imagined three conditions must be met. Firstly, beliefs about teaching, learning and feedback must reflect those embedded in the Discourse. Secondly, there must be a close alignment between those beliefs and practice. Thirdly, teachers must acquire in-depth subject matter knowledge, which will enable them to create the dialogic forms of feedback necessary for students to become self-monitoring and self-regulatory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random effects models for ordinal data</field><field name="creator">Lee, Arier Chi-Lun</field><field name="description">One of the most frequently encountered types of data is where the response variables are measured on an ordinal scale. Although there have been substantial developments in the statistical techniques for the analysis of ordinal data, methods appropriate for repeatedly assessed ordinal data collected from field experiments are limited. A series of biennial field screening trials for evaluating cultivar resistance of potato to the disease, late blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary has been conducted by the New Zealand Institute of Crop and Food Research since 1983. In each trial, the progression of late blight was visually assessed several times during the planting season using a nine-point ordinal scale based on the percentage of necrotic tissues. As for many other agricultural field experiments, spatial differences between the experimental units is one of the major concerns in the analysis of data from the potato late blight trial. The aim of this thesis is to construct a statistical model which can be used to analyse the data collected from the series of potato late blight trials. We review existing methodologies for analysing ordinal data with mixed effects particularly those methods in the Bayesian framework. Using data collected from the potato late blight trials we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for the analyses of repeatedly assessed ordinal scores with spatial effects, in particular the time dependence of the scores assessed on the same experimental units was modelled by a sigmoid logistic curve. Data collected from the potato late blight trials demonstrated the importance of spatial effects in agricultural field trials. These effects cannot be neglected when analysing such data. Although statistical methods can be refined to account for the complexity of the data, appropriate trial design still plays a central role in field experiments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="subject">random effect</field><field name="subject">ordinal data</field><field name="subject">late blight</field><field name="subject">repeated measures</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated technology in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum : a case study of computer algebra systems</field><field name="creator">Oates, Greg</field><field name="description">The effective integration of technology into the teaching and learning of mathematics remains one of the critical challenges facing tertiary mathematics, which has traditionally been slow to respond to technological innovation. This thesis reveals that the term integration is widely used in the literature with respect to technology and the curriculum, although its meaning can vary substantially, and furthermore, the term is seldom well defined. A review of the literature provides the basis for a survey of undergraduate mathematics educators, to determine their use of technology, their views of what an Integrated Technology Mathematics Curriculum (ITMC) may resemble, and how it may be achieved. Responses to this survey, and factors identified in the literature, are used to construct a taxonomy of integrated technology. The taxonomy identifies six defining characteristics of an ITMC, each with a number of associated elements. A visual model using radar diagrams is developed to compare courses against the taxonomy, and to identify aspects needing attention in individual courses. T Evidence from an observational study of initiatives to introduce Computer Algebra Systems into undergraduate mathematics courses at The University of Auckland, firstly using CAS-calculators and latterly computer software, is examined against the taxonomy. A number of critical issues influencing the integration of these technologies are identified. These include mandating technology use in official departmental policy, attention to congruency and fairness in assessment, re-evaluating the value of topics in the curriculum, re-establishing the goals of undergraduate courses, and developing the pedagogical technical knowledge of teaching staff. The thesis concludes that effective integration of technology in undergraduate mathematics requires a recognition of, and comprehensive attention to, the interdependence of the taxonomy components. An integrated, holistic approach, which aims for curricular congruency across all elements of the taxonomy, provides the basis for a more consistent, effective and sustainable ITMC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Embedded Faith Journeys of Generations X and Y within New Zealand Church Communities</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Carlton Graeme</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Generation X</field><field name="subject">Generation Y</field><field name="subject">Church</field><field name="subject">Faith Journeys</field><field name="subject">Church Switching</field><field name="subject">Church Two-Timing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Torrent of Portyngale: a critical edition</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, Keith David</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Middle English</field><field name="subject">Romance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential role of chemokines in redirecting progenitor cell migration into the lesioned striatum</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Rene&#769;e</field><field name="description">A number of studies have demonstrated directed migration of neural progenitor cells to sites of brain injury and disease. However, a detailed examination of when a cell is &#8220;born&#8221; in relation to injury induction and the migratory response of that cell has not previously been determined. This study therefore examined the temporal correlation between progenitor cell proliferation (&#8220;birth&#8221;) and neuroblast migratory response into the damaged striatum following quinolinic acid (QA) lesioning of the adult rat striatum. Retroviral labeling of subventricular zone (SVZ)&#8211;derived progenitor cells demonstrated that cell loss in the QA-lesioned striatum increased progenitor cell migration through the rostral migratory stream for up to 30 days. In addition, a population of dividing cells originating from the SVZ generated doublecortin positive neuroblasts that migrated into the damaged striatum in response to cell loss invoked by the QA lesion. The majority of doublecortin positive neuroblasts present in the damaged striatum were generated from progenitor cells dividing within two days prior to, or on the day of QA lesioning. In contrast, cells dividing two or more days following QA lesioning, migrated into the striatum and exhibited a glial phenotype. These results demonstrate that directed migration of SVZ-derived cells and neuroblast differentiation in response to QA lesioning of the striatum is acute and transient. We subsequently demonstrated a role for the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; in directing adult SVZ-derived progenitor cell migration following striatal cell death. MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; were significantly upregulated in the striatum 2-3 days following QA-induced lesioning, correlating with maximum SVZ-derived progenitor cell recruitment into the lesioned striatum. We established that SVZ-derived progenitor cells express receptors for each chemokine, and demonstrated MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; to be potent chemoattractants for SVZ-derived progenitor cells in vitro. Immunofluorescence revealed MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; and GRO-&#945; are predominantly expressed in the striatum by NG2-positive cells that appear to infiltrate from the bloodstream 6 hours following QA lesioning. These results indicate that upregulation of MCP-1, MIP-1&#945;, GRO-&#945; following striatal cell death leads to chemoattraction of SVZ-derived progenitor cells into the damaged striatum and raises a potential role for blood-derived cells in directing the recruitment of SVZ progenitor cells following brain injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of boron corrole complexes</field><field name="creator">Albrett, Amelia</field><field name="description">Boron complexes of porphyrin analogues are rare and typically difficult to prepare.  The possibility of extending this chemistry further to include corroles was intriguing and provided the main motivation for this work.  The coordination chemistry of boron with corroles was explored.  The aim was to see whether boron could be coordinated within the corrole N4 core and if so whether novel or similar structural types resulted, relative to the closely related porphyrin system.  Boron halides and aryl halides were reacted with free base corroles in the presence of diisopropylethylamine.  The methodology employed was similar to that used for boron porphyrin systems.  As well as free base corrole, an N-methyl corrole and trilithiated corrole were also used as starting materials.  Several boron corrole structural types were obtained.  The reaction of free base corrole with boron trifluoroetherate led to the first structurally characterised corrole with boron bound within the N4 core, B2OF2(corrole).  From this reagent a mono-boron species, BF2(corrole) was also obtained.  With dichlorophenylborane, several boron corrole complexes were prepared including PhB2O(corrole), PhB2(corrole) and B2Ph2H(corrole).  The latter species was structurally characterised and the bridging hydride is proposed to form through a reductive coupling process.  Use of N-methyl corrole effectively blocked one boron binding site and subsequently mono-boron corroles BF2(N-methyl- corrole), BPh(OH)(N-methyl corrole) and BPhF(N-methyl corrole) were prepared in good yields.  The reaction of lithiated corrole and dichloroplenylborane afforded B2Ph2Cl(corrole).  Overall, several new boron corrole species were prepared, significantly extending the library of known boron complexes with ligands related to the porphyrin system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrole</field><field name="subject">boron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antitumour efficacy of the nitroreductase-armed oncolytic adenovirus ONYX-411NTR in combination with dinitrobenzamide mustard prodrugs in preclinical models</field><field name="creator">Singleton, Dean Craig</field><field name="description">Oncolytic viruses that selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells are a promising approach for the treatment of tumours that are resistant to conventional therapies. Clinical experience has shown that oncolytic viruses are safe and well tolerated but possess modest single agent activity. One approach to improve the efficacy of oncolytic viruses is to utilise their tumour tropism to deliver genes encoding enzymes able to activate prodrugs. ONYX-411 is an oncolytic adenovirus that replicates in cells that carry dysfunctions in the retinoblastoma (pRb) pathway, a common hallmark of cancer. ONYX-411 was &#8216;armed&#8217; by inserting the Escherichia coli nfsB nitroreductase (NTR) gene into the E3B region of the viral genome under the control of the endogenous E3 viral transcriptional machinery. NTR is an oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase that is capable of activating dinitrobenzamide mustard (DNBM) prodrugs to cytotoxic metabolites. The main objective of this thesis was to determine the extent and mechanism of the therapeutic interaction between ONYX-411NTR and DNBM prodrugs. A fluorogenic probe was developed to monitor NTR activity non-invasively and revealed robust, replication dependent NTR activity in ONYX-411NTR-infected neoplastic but not primary human cell lines. In vitro exposure of ONYX-411NTR-infected cells to therapeutically relevant concentrations of the DNBM prodrugs (SN 27686 or PR-104A) did not inhibit virus replication.  Tumour growth delay studies of systemic ONYX-411NTR followed by prodrug demonstrated different outcomes in three models (H1299, C33A, 22Rv1). To establish predictable viral infection of tumours a pre-infection model was developed using HCT 116 xenografts. This methodology demonstrated that prodrug administration (SN 28343 or PR-104) provided significant inhibition of tumour growth without suppression of ONYX-411NTR replication. Follow-on studies using intravenous virus administration confirmed titre amplification with time (24-fold between day 3 and 13 post administration; P &lt; 0.001) and a marked survival gain for the virus/prodrug combinations. Neither the prodrugs nor ONYX-411NTR were active as single agents. The improvement in efficacy for the combination of ONYX-411NTR and prodrug was conditional on NTR-dependent prodrug activation resulting in improved virus distribution within the tumour.  PR-104 is currently in clinical development making the combination of ONYX-411NTR with PR-104 a promising strategy for cancer selective therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oncolytic</field><field name="subject">Prodrug</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy</field><field name="subject">Gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal speciation in complex aquatic environments : the copper, cadmium, ferrihydrite, phthalic acid and bacterial system</field><field name="creator">Song, Yantao</field><field name="description">Trace metal speciation in aquatic environments is inherently complex due to the large number of possible interactions with dissolved and particulate components. Adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxide and bacterial surfaces, as well as the formation of metal-ligand complexes can play important roles in controlling the fate and transport of trace metals in natural environments. The objective of this study is to describe and understand metal speciation and distribution in a complex biogeochemical system by incrementally increasing the complexity from simple binary systems to a dynamic quaternary system containing a trace metal, iron oxide and bacteria that are active and metabolizing an organic ligand. Copper, cadmium, and phthalic acid (H2Lp) adsorption onto ferrihydrite in binary systems was well reproduced using the diffuse layer model (DLM). The adsorption of H2Lp adsorption was analogous to that of inorganic diprotic acids in terms of the relationship between the adsorption constants and acidity constants. In ternary systems H2Lp caused Cu2+ or Cd2+ adsorption to be either enhanced (due to surface ternary complex formation) or inhibited (due to solution complex formation) depending on the conditions. The DLM could only describe the effect of H2Lp on metal ion sorption by including ternary complexes of the form &#8801;FeOHMLp (0), where &#8801;FeOH is a surface site and M is Cu or Cd. The relationship between binary metal adsorption constants and the ternary complex adsorption constants from this and previous studies suggest several properties of ternary complexes. First, ternary complex structures on both ferrihydrite and goethite are either the same or similar. Second, those cations having large adsorption constants also have large equilibrium constants for ternary complex formation. Third, ligands forming stronger solution complexes with cations will also form stronger surface ternary complexes but because of the strong solution complexes these ligands will not necessarily enhance cation adsorption. The bacterial strain Comamonas spp. was isolated from the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant. Comamonas spp. could effectively degrade H2Lp in the presence of Cd2+ and ferrihydrite and was therefore chosen to study the effect of H2Lp degradation on Cd2+ speciation. Proton, cadmium and H2Lp adsorption onto Comamonas spp. were measured. The Comamonas spp. titration curve is flatter than that of ferrihydrite, indicating a higher degree of site heterogeneity at the bacterial surface. Adsorption edges of Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. occurred over about 4~5 pH units compared to those of ferrihydrite which occurred over &#8776; 2 pH units on a dry weight basis. Comamonas spp. can accumulate a larger amount of Cd2+ than ferrihydrite especially under lower pH conditions. Proton and Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. cells over a wide sorbent/sorbate and pH range was reasonably well described by a four site non-electrostatic model. The acid-base and Cd2+ adsorption behaviour of Comamonas spp. in this work were within the range of studies of bacteria adsorption. Phthalic acid adsorption onto inactive Comamonas spp. was negligible over a pH range of 3 to 8 and became significant only at pH &lt; 3 where H2Lp was fully protonated. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism for ligand adsorption onto bacterial surfaces which involved a balance between hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion. The presence of H2Lp decreased Cd2+ adsorption onto Comamonas spp. due to competition for Cd2+ between the bacterial cell surface and the formation of solution complexes of Cd2+. This was accurately modelled with the Cd-Lp solution species indicating that no significant surface ternary interaction occurred between Cd2+, phthalic acid and Comamonas spp.. Cadmium adsorption onto ferrihydrite-Comamonas spp. mixtures was slightly less than the simple additive predicted adsorption of ferrihydrite plus Comamonas spp.. This suggests there is a weak interaction between ferrihydrite and Comamonas spp. and this interaction could be modelled by including a generic reaction between the ferrihydrite and Comamonas spp. surface sites. Cadmium distribution in a system of inactive Comamonas spp.-ferrihydrite in the absence and presence of H2Lp could be predicted by combining the ferrihydrite and bacteria models with the inclusion of the ferrihydrite-bacteria interaction. The effects of H2Lp degradation on Cd2+ distribution were investigated in dynamic systems with live bacteria. Results showed that Cd2+ adsorption in these dynamic systems was reasonably estimated with the model parameters developed in the proceeding experiments though uncertainty exists in the dynamic process with regards to H2Lp biodegradation products and changes in the bacteria population. This thesis was therefore able to provide a better understanding of metal speciation in complex and heterogeneous realistic environments by experimentally examining and modelling metal speciation and distribution in various systems with increasing complexity. This helps to bridge the gap of quantitative description of metal speciation from simple laboratory experiment systems to real world systems, both natural and engineered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace Metal; Bacteria; Ferrihydrite; Sorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cortical thinning and neuropsychological changes in presymptomatic Huntington's Disease</field><field name="creator">Davison, John W.</field><field name="description">Degeneration of the striatum and striatal-frontal circuits are generally thought to cause most of the neuropsychological symptoms experienced in Huntington&#8216;s Disease (HD). Advances in cortical thickness mapping (an automated MRI method for precisely measuring the cortical thickness across the entire cortex) provide a new technique for examining changes in the brain in HD. Recent studies using this technology have reported provocative results. They found significant cortical thinning in participants with early HD (Rosas et al., 2002; Rosas et al., 2008) and even in presymptomatic HD (Rosas et al., 2005). Moreover, cortical thinning was most prominent in posterior regions of the brain, with relative preservation of the anterior frontal regions. The present study replicated Rosas et al.&#8216;s (2005) study but used a larger sample of presymptomatic HD participants (n = 19) and a control group matched for age, gender and education (n = 19). Presymptomatic HD participants were divided into two groups, PreHDclose and PreHDfar, based on their estimated proximity to clinical onset. The distribution of cortical thinning was assessed using an identical MRI method to previous cortical thinning studies with HD participants. Specific neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive and mood changes that may be associated with cortical thinning. It was hypothesised that cortical thinning would be more evident in posterior than frontal cortical regions. It was also hypothesised that presymptomatic HD participants would perform more poorly than controls on tests that are subserved primarily by specific posterior cortical regions, but not on tests that are subserved by anterior cortical regions. Lastly, it was predicted that poorer performance in the neuropsychological measures would be associated with greater thinning in cortical regions that are important during performance of these tasks. Consistent with predictions, the presymptomatic HD group showed regionally-specific cortical thinning which was most prominent in the posterior cortices, particularly around the right parieto-temporal-occipital (PTO) junction. Thinning occurred in people up to 15 years before clinical onset, with little to no thinning before that. The presymptomatic HD group, and particularly the PreHDclose participants, performed significantly worse than controls in 2 of the 6 cognitive tests that are subserved primarily by posterior cortical regions (the Judgment of Line iii Orientation test and modified Roadmap Test), but not in tests that are subserved primarily by frontal cortical regions. Correlational analyses showed a number of regionally-specific relationships between thinning and cognitive performance, although the distribution of these relationships did not generally support our region-of-interest predictions. The results contribute to a better characterisation of the cortical and neuropsychological changes that occur early in the development of HD, and provide tentative support for cortical thickness mapping as a valid and sensitive measure for assessing cortical changes in presymptomatic HD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cortex</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">Huntington's disease</field><field name="subject">Cognitive</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">HD</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of children's asthma in primary care : Are there ethnic differences in care?</field><field name="creator">Crengle, Suzanne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until August 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Primary care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Health services research</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Research</field><field name="subject">Quality of care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321208 Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of washback on teaching and learning</field><field name="creator">Mizutani, Satomi</field><field name="description">The current research investigated the mechanism of the phenomenon known as washback (i.e., the impact of assessment on teaching and learning) in the context of a new national standards-based assessment system in New Zealand, particularly focusing on the area of the teaching and learning of Japanese as a foreign language. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) was progressively implemented across all subjects in the final three years of secondary schooling from 2002. It replaced norm-referenced assessments and aimed to function as assessment for learning as well as of learning. The research consisted of three studies. Studies One and Two investigated washback effects of NCEA as perceived by teachers and students of Japanese, and beliefs about NCEA which contributed to the washback effects. Participants claimed that the majority of the intended positive washback effects were promoted by the assessment, but the nature of the washback depended on beliefs about NCEA held by teachers and students. Students tended to report more negative washback of NCEA than did teachers. Study Three explored the role that contextual factors (e.g., subject, gender) and beliefs might play in mediating washback. This large-scale study involved teachers and students of Japanese, French, History, and Mathematics. Teacher and Student Questionnaires were developed to investigate washback of NCEA and beliefs about NCEA, Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Efficacy as well as to collect relevant background information on the participants. The study revealed that some contextual factors played a role in mediating certain types of beliefs and washback effects. The results also confirmed the crucial role that beliefs play in mediating washback, indicating that positive washback was promoted when participants&#8217; beliefs were in line with the intentions of the assessment. It is concluded that for educational reform through assessment change to be successful, stake holders&#8217; beliefs about the role of assessment may need to be altered. A model is presented to describe the mechanism of washback, showing how washback could be mediated directly and indirectly by contextual factors and beliefs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of stem cell development by Runx transcription factors</field><field name="creator">Lam, Enid Yi Ni</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Runx</field><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">transgenic</field><field name="subject">haematopiesis</field><field name="subject">stem cells</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unintentional falls at home among young and middle-aged adults: the influence of alcohol</field><field name="creator">Kool, Bridget</field><field name="description">Aim To investigate the epidemiology of unintentional fall-related injuries at home among young and middle-aged adults (25 to 59 years) and to investigate the contribution of alcohol to these injuries. Methods Routinely collected national fall injury data were analysed to describe the incidence and characteristics of falls at home resulting in death or hospital inpatient treatment among this age group in New Zealand. A systematic review of the published literature evaluated the epidemiological evidence quantifying the risk of falls associated with acute and usual alcohol consumption in this age group. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand over a 12-month period. Cases were 335 people aged 25 to 59 years who were admitted to hospital or died as a result of unintentional non-occupational falls at home. Controls were 352 people randomly selected from the electoral roll from the same age group as the cases. The participants or next-of-kin completed a structured interview to ascertain data on personal and lifestyle factors including alcohol consumption. Findings The review of national injury data found that almost a third of unintentional falls resulting in an in-patient admission among working-age people were recorded as occurring at home. For every death there were about 150 in-patient hospital admissions. The systematic review identified only a small number of studies but showed an increased risk of unintentional falls in this age group with increasing exposure to alcohol use. The magnitude of this risk varied considerably across studies with most estimates being relatively imprecise. There was modest evidence of a dose-response relationship with acute alcohol use. The association between usual alcohol use and fall risk was inconclusive. The case-control study revealed that after controlling for confounding, the consumption of two or more standard alcoholic drinks in the preceding six hours relative to none is associated with a significantly increased risk of fall-related injury. Approximately 21% of unintentional non-occupational falls at home in this population was attributed to this risk. No association between hazardous drinking as a usual pattern and falls was found when the analyses were adjusted for confounders. Conclusion A significant proportion of unintentional fall-related injuries among the working-aged New Zealanders occur at home. Consuming two or more drinks in the previous six hours was strongly associated with unintentional non-occupational falls at home that result in admission to hospital or death in this age group. This largely unrecognised problem should be addressed in further research and in falls prevention programmes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accidental falls</field><field name="subject">alcohol, drinking</field><field name="subject">accidents, home</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chemical gradients across porous silicon sensors</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Corrina</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the formation of compositional gradients across 0.5 &#8211; 1 cm of porous silicon layers which had thicknesses of 2 &#8211; 10 &#956;m. These compositional gradients were then characterised, and their potential use as vapour sensors was probed. Surface composition gradients have been reported on flat surfaces, but this is the first time that they have been reported on a three-dimensional material with controlled pore geometry. Chemical gradients have been generated across the surface of porous silicon by performing electrochemical attachment of organohalides with an asymmetric electrode arrangement, and by chemical hydrosilylation of alkenes in the presence of a diffusion gradient of diazonium salts across the porous silicon surface. Samples with electrochemical gradients of methyl, pentyl acetate, and decyl and using chemical hydrosilylation with gradients of undecanoic acid and decyl groups. The latter four gradient-modified porous silicon types have been &#8216;endcapped&#8217; with methyl groups to give improved stability and greater hydrophobicity. The pentyl acetate and undecanoic groups have been converted into pentanol and undecanoate groups respectively to increase the hydrophilicity of these porous silicon surfaces. The gradients have been characterised using two-dimensional FTIR microspectrophotometry and water contact angle measurements. The interaction of these gradient porous silicon samples with ethanol, heptane, toluene and 2-hexanol vapours have been monitored either by UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy at selected points across the surface or more globally using a digital camera. The undecanoate gradient porous silicon sample showed a large difference in optical response between the undecanoate end and the methyl end of the gradient when exposed to water vapour, showing that imposition of a chemical gradient can alter the sensing character of porous silicon in a controllable manner.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New control strategy for CNC machines via STEP-NC</field><field name="creator">Wang, Hongqiang</field><field name="description">The contemporary product design and manufacturing environment requires a bidirectional and seamless data flow throughout all stages of data transactions. The establishment of STEP (STandard for Exchange of Product data) offers manufacturers a new method to exchange product data in the entire product life cycle. As an extension to STEP, STEP-NC provides the potential to finally close the gap between design and manufacturing in the drive for a complete, integrated product development environment. The STEP-NC data model is a long overdue improvement in the domain of computer numerical controls (CNC) where G-codes have been in use for more than half a century. STEP-NC brings richer information to CNCs presenting an opportunity for the development of more intelligent, interoperable and informative machining. The research work documented in this thesis introduces a fully STEP-compliant CNC system with an aim to solve the problems faced by the current CNC systems, e.g. disconnection with the upper-stream activities. The research is based on the premise that a STEP-NC program can document &#8220;generic&#8221; manufacturing information (whatto- do). This way, a STEP-NC program can be made machine-independent and has an advantage over the conventional G-code based NC program that is always generated for a specific CNC machine. The core of the STEP-compliant CNC system is the mapping mechanism which accepts STEP-NC data and translates it into the type of G-code that a specific controller can understand. The STEP-compliant CNC system has two principal elements, a STEP-NC Adapter and a STEP-NC Converter. The STEP-NC Adapter takes a generic STEP-NC program as its input and produces a more specific version of the STEP-NC program by &#8220;adapting&#8221; it to a local manufacturing environment and capabilities. This native STEP-NC file is a localised version of the generic STEP-NC file. It may be re-adapted to another manufacturing environment. The STEP-NC converter takes a native STEP-NC file and converts it to the required machine control data, i.e. G-codes that are ready to be loaded to the targeted CNC controller. The conversion process is also called a mapping or translating process that utilises the manufacturing environment databases developed for specific machine tools, or rather CNC controllers. The use of function block (IEC 61499) technology gives the system robustness and modularity. The STEP-NC adapter and converter are so developed that they can be embedded into a future CNC controller, making it a STEP-NC enabled controller. The system offers ample benefits to the CNC users by providing an interface for the STEP-NC data that carries rich information and the interface itself is also more userfriendly. It realises a long-awaited paradigm of common interface for CNC machine tools. With this system in place, one generic STEP-NC program can be made to drive different CNC machine tools, making NC programs portable and universally compatible. This system supports the scenario of &#8220;design anywhere and build anywhere&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do people manage their documents?: an empirical investigation into personal document management practices among knowledge workers</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Sarah</field><field name="description">Personal document management is the activity of managing a collection of digital documents performed by the owner of the documents, and consists of creation/acquisition, organisation, finding and maintenance.  Document management is a pervasive aspect of digital work, but has received relatively little attention from researchers. The hierarchical file system used by most people to manage their documents has not conceptually changed in decades.  Although revolutionary prototypes have been developed, these have not been grounded in a thorough understanding of document management behaviour and therefore have not resulted in significant changes to document management interfaces.  Improvements in understanding document management can result in productivity gains for knowledge workers, and since document management is such a common activity, small improvements can deliver large gains. The aim of this research was to understand how people manage their personal document collections and to develop guidelines for the development of tools to support personal document management. A field study was conducted that included interviews, a survey and file system snapshot.  The interviews were conducted with ten participants to investigate their document management strategies, structures and struggles.  In addition to qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, a novel investigation technique was developed in the form of a file system snapshot which collects information about document structures and derives a number of metrics which describe the document structure.  A survey was also conducted, consisting of a questionnaire and a file system snapshot, which enabled the findings of the field study to be validated, and to collect information from a greater number of participants.  The results of this research culminated in (1) development of a conceptual framework highlighting the key personal document management  attitudes, behaviours and concerns; (2) model of basic operations that any document management system needs to provide; (3) identification of piling, filing and structuring as three key document management strategies; (4) guidelines for the development of user interfaces to support document management, including specific guidelines for each document management strategy.  These contributions both improve knowledge of personal document management on which future research can build, and provide practical advice to document management system designers which should result in the development of more usable system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal document management</field><field name="subject">document management</field><field name="subject">personal information management</field><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc Wine  Using Trained Sensory Panels</field><field name="creator">Lund, Cynthia M.</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  A core tool of sensory science is the use of trained descriptive panels.  This research describes an investigation into the role of motivation in the performance of trained panels and the use of a trained panel to develop a better understanding of the perception of Sauvignon blanc wines. Substantial investment in time and money is directed towards ensuring trained panels perform optimally.  Having selected a panel, the panel leader needs to ensure that panellists provide accurate, reliable data.  Panellist motivation is also an important factor to consider.  While performance psychology, education and sport science fields have researched motivation extensively, knowledge about panellist motivation within sensory science is limited.  However, findings from existing research in these other areas - which suggest an important role for autonomy, competence and relatedness - can be applied to sensory panels in order to increase intrinsic motivation. The initial part of the research investigated the fundamental factors that affect and influence panellists&#8217; motivation and participation.  A survey (n=74) revealed that extra income and a general interest in food were the key drivers in inspiring people to become panellists, whilst enjoyment in being a panellist, interest in food, and extra income were key drivers for people to remain panellists.  In a second survey, the intrinsic motivation of seven trained panels from four countries (n=108) was assessed.  External panels were found to be more intrinsically motivated than internal panels.  Experienced panellists had an increased perception of competence, which is a key factor for people to be intrinsically motivated.  Understanding motivational frameworks currently used in other research fields and integrating them into existing panel training protocols may enhance and sustain panellists&#8217; intrinsic motivation. A trained panel (n=14) was then used in the second part of the thesis to identify key flavours in Sauvignon blanc wines from Australia, France, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa and USA.  Sixteen characteristics were identified and measured, including sweet sweaty passionfruit, capsicum, passionfruit skin/stalk, boxwood/cat&#8217;s urine, grassy, mineral/flinty, citrus, bourbon, apple lolly/candy, tropical, mint, fresh asparagus, canned asparagus, stonefruit, apple and snowpea. Principal component analysis was used to describe differences between regions and countries.  Sauvignon blanc wines from Marlborough, New Zealand (NZ), were described by tropical and sweet sweaty passionfruit characteristics, while French and South African Sauvignon blanc wines were described as having flinty/mineral and bourbon-like flavors.  Chemical analyses of these wines also showed that Marlborough, NZ wines had more methoxypyrazine and thiol compounds.  A consumer study (n=109) showed that New Zealanders significantly prefer New Zealand style Sauvignon blanc. The final part of this research focused on using trained panellists to explore the interactions between volatile and non-volatile wine compounds and their effects on the aroma profile of New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wine.  Four volatile aroma compounds that are important in New Zealand Sauvignon blanc wine were studied (isobutyl methoxypyrazine [MIBP], 3-mercaptohexanol [3MH], 3-mercaptohexanol acetate [3MHA], and ethyl decanoate).  Each of these four aroma compounds were assessed in combination with three non-volatile polyphenolic compounds commonly found in Sauvignon blanc wine: catechin, caffeic acid and quercetin.  Results showed each polyphenol had a unique effect when blended with a specific aroma compound, either suppressing, accentuating, or showing little effect on the perception of the aroma compounds.  The perception of MIBP, 3MH, and ethyl decanoate were largely suppressed by the added polyphenols, with a few exceptions.  The perception of 3MH was accentuated with the addition of caffeic acid, and the perception of 3MHA was accentuated with the addition of catechin.  The interactive effects of aroma compounds with polyphenols likely reflect non-covalent associations in the wine solution that reduce the volatility of the aroma compounds.  With an understanding of the interactive effects of volatile and non-volatile compounds in wine, winemakers might optimize the impact of selected volatile compounds by managing polyphenol levels, supporting their efforts to attain desirable wine aroma profiles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sauvignon blanc wine</field><field name="subject">trained panel</field><field name="subject">sensory analysis</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">region</field><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">thiols</field><field name="subject">methoxy pyrazines</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">volatiles</field><field name="subject">non volatiles</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting evidence to and from general practice consultations for cardiovascular risk management using computerised decision support</field><field name="creator">Wells, Linda Susan Mary</field><field name="description">Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has an enormous impact on the lives and health of New Zealanders. There is substantial epidemiological evidence that supports identifying people at high risk of CVD and treating them with lifestyle and drug-based interventions. If fully implemented, this targeted high risk approach could reduce future CVD events by over 50%. Recent studies have shown that a formal CVD risk assessment to the systematically identify high risk patients is rarely done in routine New Zealand general practice and audits of CVD risk management have shown large evidence-practice gaps. The CVD risk prediction score recommended by New Zealand guidelines for identifying high CVD risk patients was derived from the US Framingham Heart Study using data collected between the 1960s and 1980s. This score has only modest prediction accuracy and there are particular concerns about it&#8217;s validity for New Zealand sub-populations such as high risk ethnic groups or people with diabetes. Aims The overall aims of this thesis were to investigate the potential of a computerised decision support system (CDSS) to improve the assessment and management of CVD risk in New Zealand general practice while simultaneously developing a sustainable cohort study that could be used for validating and improving CVD risk prediction scores and related research. Methods An environmental scan of the New Zealand health care setting&#8217;s readiness to support a CDSS was conducted .The epidemiological evidence was reviewed to assess the effect of decision support systems on the quality of health care and the types and functionality of systems most likely to be successful. This was followed by a focused systematic review of randomised trials evaluating the impact of CDSS on CVD risk assessment and management practices and patient CVD outcomes in primary care. A web-based CDSS (PREDICT) was collaboratively developed. This rules-based provider-initiated system with audit and feedback and referral functionalities was fully integrated with general practice electronic medical records in a number of primary health organisations (PHOs). The evidence-based content was derived from national CVD and diabetes guidelines. When clinicians used PREDICT at the time of a consultation, treatment recommendations tailored to the patient&#8217;s CVD and diabetes risk profile were delivered to support decision-making within seconds. Simultaneously, the patient&#8217;s CVD risk profiles were securely stored on a central server. With PHO permission, anonymised patient data were linked via encrypted patient National Health Index numbers to national death and hospitalisation data. Three analytical studies using these data are described in this thesis. The first evaluated changes in GP risk assessment practice following implementation of PREDICT; the second investigated patterns of use of the CDSS by GPs and practice nurses; and the third describes the emerging PREDICT cohort and a preliminary validation of risk prediction scores. Results Given the rapid development of organised primary care since the 1990&#8217;s, the high degree of general practice computerisation and the New Zealand policy (health, informatics, privacy) environment, the introduction of a CDSS into the primary care setting was deemed feasible. The evidence for the impact of CDSS in general has been moderately favourable in terms of improving desired practice. Of the randomised trials of CDSS for assessing or managing CVD risk, about two-thirds reported improvements in provider processes and two-fifths reported some improvements in intermediate patient outcomes. No adverse effects were reported. Since 2002, the PREDICT CDSS has been implemented progressively in PHOs within Northland and the three Auckland regional District Health Board catchments, covering a population of 1.5 million. A before-after audit conducted in three large PHOs showed that CVD risk documentation increased four fold after the implementation of PREDICT. To date, the PREDICT dataset includes around 63,000 risk assessments conducted on a cohort of over 48,000 people by over 1000 general practitioners and practice nurses. This cohort has been followed from baseline for a median of 2.12 years. During that time 2655 people died or were hospitalised with a CVD event. Analyses showed that the original Framingham risk score was reasonably well calibrated overall but underestimated risk in high risk ethnic groups. Discrimination was only modest (AUC 0.701). An adjusted Framingham score, recommended by the New Zealand Guideline Group (NZGG) overestimated 5-year event rates by around 4-7%, in effect lowering the threshold for drug therapy to about 10% 5-year predicted CVD risk. The NZGG adjusted score (AUC 0.676) was less discriminating than the Framingham score and over-adjusted for high risk ethnic groups. For the cohort aged 30-74 years, the NZGG-recommended CVD risk management strategy identified almost half of the population as eligible for lifestyle management +/- drug therapy and this group generated 82% of all CVD events. In contrast the original Framingham score classified less than one-third of the cohort as eligible for individualised management and this group generated 71% of the events that occurred during follow-up. Implications This research project has demonstrated that a CDSS tool can be successfully implemented on a large scale in New Zealand general practice. It has assisted practitioners to improve the assessment and management of CVD at the time of patient consultation. Simultaneously, PREDICT has cost-effectively generated one of the largest cohorts of M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori ever assembled in New Zealand. As the cohort grows, new CVD risk prediction scores will be able to be developed for many New Zealand sub-populations. It will also provide clinicians and policy makers with the information needed to determine the trade-offs between the resources required to manage increasing proportions of the populations and the likely impact of management on preventing CVD events.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision support system</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">family practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems with variable-bit-rate traffic</field><field name="creator">Sowden, Bradley Claude</field><field name="description">The deployment of third generation (3G) cellular systems is resulting in a transition from cellular systems that predominantly carry constant-bit-rate (CBR) voice traffic to multi-service packet based systems that predominantly carry variable-bit-rate (VBR) traffic. With 3G DS-CDMA cellular systems there is a direct relationship between user traffic and propagation dependent performance as additional traffic causes increased system interference. This thesis investigates the impact of VBR traffic on the propagation dependent performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems that utilise frame-by-frame dynamic resource allocation on the radio channel. A DS-CDMA cellular system model is developed and the downlink performance of both outdoor macro-cellular and indoor pico-cellular systems is evaluated with a variety of traffic types. Both traffic scheduling performance and propagation dependent performance are evaluated as the two are inter-linked. Scenarios are identified where propagation dependent performance is sensitive to the statistical properties of the user traffic streams and it is shown that a significant performance difference potentially exists between different traffic types when the number of users per cell is low. When a significant performance difference does exist, burstier more variable traffic generally results in superior propagation dependent performance. The base transceiver station (BTS) transmitter power mean and variance provides a good indication of the level of propagation dependent performance regardless of the specific traffic type. Traffic scheduling policies that deliberately reduce the variability of user traffic streams are considered and in terms of propagation dependent performance these are shown to have a minimal impact on the performance difference between different traffic types. The implications of VBR traffic on DS-CDMA cellular system design are outlined and it is shown that VBR traffic can be approximated as CBR traffic in many scenarios and this is a convenient approximation as it simplifies system design and detailed traffic models do not need to be developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in apple by the transcription factor MdMYB10</field><field name="creator">Espley, Richard V.</field><field name="description">Anthocyanin concentration is an important determinant of the colour of many fruits. In apple (Malus x domestica), centuries of breeding have produced numerous varieties in which levels of anthocyanin pigment vary widely and change differently in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The apple fruit cortex is usually colourless, although germplasm does exist where the cortex is highly pigmented due to the accumulation of anthocyanins, carotenoids or chlorophylls. From studies in a diverse array of plants species, it is apparent that anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. In this thesis the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a red-fleshed apple are compared with a white-fleshed cultivar. A MYB transcription factor (TF), MdMYB10, was isolated and is shown to be similar in sequence to known anthocyanin regulators in other species. Further, this TF is shown to induce anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented patches in transient assays in tobacco leaves and highly pigmented apple plants following stable transformation with constitutively expressed MdMYB10. Efficient induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by MdMYB10 was dependent on the co-expression of two bHLH proteins from apple, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. A strong correlation between expression of MdMYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development suggests that this TF is responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit; in the red-fleshed cultivar and in the skin of other varieties, there is an induction of MdMYB10 expression concurrent with colour formation during development. Mutations in the genes encoding for either the biosynthetic or transcriptional regulation of the anthocyanin pathway have been linked to colour phenotypes. Generally this is a loss of function resulting in a reduction or a change in the distribution of anthocyanin. The upstream regulatory region of MdMYB10 was investigated and found to contain a rearrangement. This modification is responsible for increasing the level of anthocyanin throughout the plant to produce a striking phenotype that includes red foliage and red fruit flesh. It consists of a series of multiple repeats, forming a minisatellite-like structure that comprises five direct tandem repeats of a 23 base pair sequence. This MdMYB10 rearrangement is present in all the red foliage apple varieties and species tested, but in none of the white fleshed varieties. Transient assays demonstrated that the 23 bp sequence motif is a target of the MdMYB10 protein itself, and the number of repeat units correlates with an increase in transactivation by MdMYB10 protein. The repeat motif is capable of binding MdMYB10 protein in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement in the promoter of MdMYB10 has generated an autoregulatory locus and this autoregulation is sufficient to account for the increase in MdMYB10 transcript levels and subsequent ectopic accumulation of anthocyanins throughout the plant. Characterisation of MdMYB10 and the rearrangement in the promoter region has implications for the development of new varieties through classical breeding or a biotechnological approach. Understanding whether this mutation is simply an allele of other recently published apple MYB TFs, or if this is the only R2R3 MYB TF involved in apple anthocyanin response, is a challenge for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You bet your life...and mine!  Contemporary Samoan gambling in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Perese, Lana</field><field name="description">Pacific peoples in New Zealand are identified as having the highest risk and prevalence of problem and pathological gambling behaviours.  Despite increasing awareness of gambling related harms in New Zealand there is a dearth of research on Pacific gambling, the reasons for problem gambling and the risks gambling poses for these populations. This thesis examines contemporary Samoan gambling and problem gambling through the perceptions and in-depth understandings of thirty-two Samoan participants.  Pacific research methodologies premised on Pacific epistemologies, practices and protocols provide the cultural framework that supports the qualitative methods used in this research.  These cultural methodologies also provide the context within which data gathered is analysed, interpreted and discussed.  The method used within this thesis is an amalgam of Pacific and grounded theory approaches. The research identifies Samoan cultural factors that play a major role in understanding contemporary Samoan gambling.  It links the deep-rooted cultural understandings of va/teu le va that are associated with early Samoan games and sports with contemporary Samoan gambling behaviours and practices.  The research provides cultural understandings of the complex conditions and processes within which contemporary Samoan gambling and problem gambling are embedded, constituted and differentiated for Samoan people in New Zealand.  These understandings are used to explore the extent to which gambling impacts harm Samoan individuals, families and communities.  The research also describes cultural factors that are associated with motivations for contemporary Samoan gambling. It demonstrates that concepts such as &#8216;winning&#8217;, &#8216;fundraising&#8217; and &#8216;socialising&#8217; act as primary motivations for engagement and explores ways in which these drivers challenge the va and teu le va that are inherent within fa&#8217;aSamoa. The potency of these new motivations is illustrated through consideration of cultural practices such as fa&#8217;alavelave, status acquisition, religion and hospitality.  These factors are not only complex but they also play an important role in the initiation, development and maintenance of Samoan gambling.   This thesis articulates a broad knowledge base of cultural factors, practices, influences and understandings that are associated with contemporary Samoan gambling in New Zealand.  It highlights how Samoan (problem) gambling while often rationalised in terms of aiga enhancing precepts is in reality most often undermining and eroding of aiga values and practices. In light of these findings, contextually effective Samoan solutions incorporated into Public Health interventions are recommended as a means of addressing the alarming gambling-related issues facing Samoan people in New Zealand.   A greater emphasis on aiga/familial interventions rather than focusing on individuals is crucial since aiga and close social networks are identified as playing an important role in the development and maintenance of gambling behaviour and can also be effective catalysts and supports for behavioural change.  Further research is indicated to better understand and develop the knowledge-base on contemporary Samoan gambling with specific relevance to Samoan youth and adult populations in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samoan Gambling</field><field name="subject">Pacific epistemologies</field><field name="subject">Samoan epistemologies</field><field name="subject">Samoan Problem Gambling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward empirical IP host traffic measurement in passive network measurement</field><field name="creator">Lee, Dong Jin</field><field name="description">An IP flow represents a group of packets that share the same attribute such as their source address. The ever-growing network traffic produces an enormous number of flows. Recent studies attempt to simplify and mine flows in order to understand the network&#8217;s behaviour. The traditional technique of packet aggregation to 5-tuple flows provides understanding of the flows themselves, but fails to capture an understanding of the aggregated end-point that generates flows: the IP host. This thesis describes the design, development and analysis of a measurement method that identifies an IP host from network traffic. A conceptual model of IP host aggregations has been designed to summarize traffic: from 5-tuple to 2-tuple and finally to 1-tuple IP host. Using the framework, various observations and analyses have been conducted at the host level, including empirical distributions and behaviour relationships. Several host characteristics and applications are examined from real-world network data, such as characterizing host interaction variability and identifying hosts that are potentially significant.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms underlying hypoxic ischemic injury to the developing brain: The significance of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9</field><field name="creator">Ranasinghe, Himani Sumudumalee</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) injury is a leading cause of long-term neurological complications in newborn babies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases that are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. They are considered to be integral in many physiological processes.  However, recently it has been demonstrated that the inappropriate activity of these proteases, particularly MMP-2 and 9, contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in the adult brain. Given that ECM disruption is frequently observed following injury to the developing brain, it is possible that MMPs play an important role in HI injury processes in the developing brain. Therefore, this thesis evaluated the hypothesis that MMP-2 and 9 participate in the pathophysiology of HI injury to the developing brain. Since ECM remodelling is a fundamental process during brain development it was important to first characterise the MMP-2 and 9 profiles in the normal developing forebrain. We demonstrated that MMP-2, which mainly was observed in cortical plate neurons, declined with age, thus indicating a potential role in the development and differentiation of the cortical plate. Conversely, MMP-9 was increased with age, particularly during active myelination, indicating that it may contribute in myelination. Secondly, we showed an upregulation of MMP-9 within the ischemic core during the early hours following HI injury, suggesting that MMP-9 may be involved in the development of delayed injury processes following hypoxic ischemia. On the contrary, MMP-2 was strongly upregulated during a later stage following injury surrounding the ischemic core possibly suggesting that it plays a role in wound repair processes. Thirdly, the profiles of tissue (tPA) and urokinase (uPA) plasminogen activators were characterised following HI injury since they are known to be major upstream activators of MMPs. uPA upregulation paralleled that of MMP-2 suggesting a function for uPA in wound repair processes following HI injury to the developing brain through activation of MMP-2. In contrast with uPA, tPA activity remained unaffected following injury at both ages. Finally, MMP-9 activity was inhibited using a very specific MMP-2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, to determine if the MMP-9 deficiency protects the developing brain from HI injury. The elevated MMP-9 activity following HI injury was attenuated by the SB-3CT treatment. Although SB-3CT failed to confer any significant neuroprotection, we recommend that further investigations are needed before discounting the role of MMP-9 during HI injury to the developing brain. In conclusion, we suggest that MMP-9 is induced following an insult to the developing brain potentially contributing to the delayed neuronal death whilst MMP-2 is involved in essential developmental, differentiation and wound repair processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Ischemia</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Injury</field><field name="subject">Developmental</field><field name="subject">MMP-9</field><field name="subject">MMP-2</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visions of madness: an investigation into cinematic representations of unreason</field><field name="creator">Manley, Dean</field><field name="description">Madness is often associated with violence, criminality, and degenerative human failure in stigmatising media reports, and these are most people&#8217;s site of information about madness. Despite (or maybe because of) reductions in stigmatising reporting,  negative perceptions of madness persist, notwithstanding stringent broadcast standards and expensive public health campaigns. When regulation dominates, extreme views can move underground  into less monitored areas such as film which enjoys a wider scope to explore ideas and issues concerning a culture. Agencies which have more freedom to represent madness beyond objective journalistic conventions can be more subversive. This work takes Foucault&#8217;s archaeology of madness (among other works) as its point of departure to look at cinematic representations of madness, exploring the notion that cinema reflects and reinforces the asylum discourse. It investigates cinema as a strategy of neurotic reiteration to confine madness in narrative&#8212;to close down the spectre of the Other&#8212;in cultural structures to exorcise it from the collective consciousness. Commercial imperatives drive stigmatising representations of madness, drawing on cultural loadings inherent in the asylum discourse, trading on demonising and pathologising to exacerbate drama and tension, essential elements of tragedy. Foucault&#8217;s framework is the basis for detailed analyses and close readings of a selection of cinematic representations, critiquing their role as constituent of, and constituting, the spectacle of madness. The films considered are from New Zealand and dominant (i.e. Hollywood) cinema in order to permit comparisons between representations here and overseas. This work follows my master&#8217;s thesis (1999), which used a similar methodology to examine representations of suicide in cinema in four popular films. Here, I look at the ideas that represent knowledge and authority about madness as represented in discourses associated with cinema. I look at loadings of illness, moral failure, Otherness, animality, and the mechanisms through which the asylum discourse of containment and spectacle is validated (or otherwise). This links with Fuery&#8217;s discussion of madness and cinema, and madness as a necessary aspect of spectatorship that makes cinema possible. It also connects to my current employment on a project addressing stigma and discrimination against people with experience of madness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">madness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-agent based ambient intelligence platform</field><field name="creator">Wang, Kevin I-Kai</field><field name="description">The vision of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can be realised through the integration of embedded technologies, distributed systems, middleware and human machine interfaces and many research efforts have been made to advance these technologies. However, the exclusiveness of these ambient intelligence technologies has reduced their practical values. In this thesis, a novel AmI platform is proposed to facilitate the integration and interoperability of various technologies in the process of developing AmI applications. The platform defines the overall software/hardware architecture and communication interfaces and provides a common base for development, operation and future adaptation of AmI applications.	The proposed platform consists of four layers, the physical ubiquitous environment, middleware, multi-agent system (MAS) and application layer. The ubiquitous environment layer accommodates any type of embedded device network for interconnecting different sensors, actuators and computing devices. The middleware layer is built using an IP-based service discovery protocol, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which provides a unique communication interface for controlling and monitoring embedded devices. The MAS handles the core distributed and adaptive control functionality and communication with user interfaces. The application layer contains any type of user interface for different AmI applications. An XML-based content language is designed with an XML schema and seven XML messages. The content language standardises the way of interpreting contents of communication between different user interfaces and the MAS.	Based on the proposed platform, a complete AmI application prototype called Distributed Embedded Intelligence Room (DEIR) has been implemented. Four different device networks, the SmartHouse network, IP network, Bluetooth and Zigbee network, have been integrated in DEIR to interconnect various embedded sensors and devices. The MAS is implemented using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). Four application specific agents, known as the UPnP control point agent, IP interface agent, fuzzy inference agent and decision tree agent, are designed and implemented. The UPnP control point agent provides MAS the ability to monitor and to control the underlying hardware devices through the UPnP middleware layer. The IP interface agent handles communication with user interfaces over socket connections. Fuzzy inference and decision tree agents are implemented to provide personalised learning and automated control capabilities. Three user interfaces, including a remote graphical user interface, a mobile PDA interface and a 3D virtual reality interface are implemented. Contents of communication between these user interfaces and the MAS are encoded using the proposed XML content language and transmitted over socket connections.	The AmI application prototype, DEIR, has demonstrated the ability of integrating multiple device networks and multiple user interfaces, which is a vital feature for most AmI applications. Two case studies have been carried out to incorporate two adaptive learning and controlling algorithms, known as the adaptive online fuzzy inference system (AOFIS) and ID3 decision tree algorithm, in the MAS of DEIR. The results of case studies show that DEIR has the ability of incorporating multiple adaptive control algorithms as multiple agents. In addition, comparable or better offline learning accuracy and learning speed have been achieved by DEIR compared with other advanced adaptive control algorithms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ambient Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of the brain and sensory systems of the kiwi</field><field name="creator">Corfield, Jeremy R.</field><field name="description">Kiwi (Apteryx spp.) have evolved under unique evolutionary pressures and uniquely occupy a nocturnal, ground-dwelling niche. They share few traits with other birds: they have small eyes, an elongated bill, and several features more characteristic of mammals. Early anatomical studies described a number of unique features in the kiwi brain, but their relevance to the behaviour and ecology of the species was not clearly established. This study aims to describe the structure of the primary cranial sensory systems of kiwi and comment on the evolutionary pressures that may have shaped their current form. The external morphology and relatively large size of the brain of kiwi, in particular those of the telencephalon, contrast with those of other Palaeognaths. The relative size of the cerebral hemispheres is rivalled only by a handful of parrots and songbirds. This enlargement results from a differential enlargement of the nidopallium, mesopallium and, to a lesser extent, of the basal ganglia. In other birds these regions are associated with the integration of information, cognition and learning. Kiwi brain centres processing visual information were small, although the retina structure showed an adaptation to dim light. The olfactory and trigeminal systems associated with the bill were hypertrophied. The auditory system shows specialisations associated with an overrepresentation of high frequency coding areas that originates in the cochlea and is preserved throughout the auditory brainstem. In absolute terms, the upper frequency response limit, based on hair cell morphology, is estimated to be about 5 kHz, the lower limit to be about 500 Hz, with a slightly higher frequency range predicted from the morphology of central auditory structures. The organisation of both nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus laminaris (NL) in kiwi suggest that the central auditory system has retained the ancestral organisation except for the morphological features associated with the overrepresentation of high frequencies. Overall, the brain and sensory structures of kiwi have evolved neural adaptations that accompany the very different behavioural strategies associated with the unique niche the birds occupy. A large telencephalic size and shift away from vision towards an increased reliance on olfactory, tactile and auditory cues constitute a collection of features that make kiwi unique among birds. These findings provide a unique glimpse of the evolutionary history that has led to this unusual design, in particular, and challenge many of our current views about the evolution of brains and encephalisation, in general.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kiwi, brain.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the slide photography of Gladys Cunningham</field><field name="creator">Benjamin, Julie Maree</field><field name="description">Transparencies: New Zealand from 1953 to 1974 through the Slide Photography of Gladys Cunningham This thesis focuses on the amateur slide photography of Gladys Cunningham, formerly of Onehunga, Auckland. Viewed collectively, these slides provide a visual autobiography of a New Zealand woman&#8217;s life, as well as a larger social narrative. As Gladys&#8217;s granddaughter, I argue that Gladys&#8217;s 35mm colour transparencies, nostalgic fragments that memorialise a family history, are informed by the social history of European New Zealanders between the early 1950s and early 1970s. Gladys&#8217;s slides reflect stabilities and changes for the photographer herself, her family and New Zealand society. While the term &#8220;transparency&#8221; suggests that the meaning of a slide can be understood by all, in reality further contextual information is necessary to appreciate the family and public histories from which these scenes have been separated. To situate Gladys&#8217;s slides, I refer to popular magazines and tourist texts from this period, including The Weekly News, National Geographic and New Zealand Holiday, and to commercial slides, postcards and travel marketing texts. I analyse the near absence of Maori within Gladys&#8217;s slides and travel journalism, suggesting that their omissions represent a lack of dialogue between Pakeha and Maori. In New Zealand and overseas, slide photography was the popular medium for recording extraordinary family events during the 1950 and 1960s. Through an analysis of memory, leisure and photography, this study examines how Gladys&#8217;s photography documents family and community membership and celebration. I explore how aesthetically pleasing representations of family leisure also contain partly concealed clues to less positive memories and to secrets that were not unique to this family. I discuss the impact of private and public transport on Gladys&#8217;s slide photography, noting how car travel facilitated spatial and temporal freedoms, and how slide photography strengthened connections to extended family and distant communities. In contrast, Gladys and Jim&#8217;s later dependence on coach transport enhanced their ability to take slides and expanded the &#8220;family&#8221; gaze of their camera, but limited their photographic opportunities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Life and customs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Social Conditions</field><field name="subject">Travel photography</field><field name="subject">Landscape Photography new Zealand</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Autobiographical Memory</field><field name="subject">Photography of Families</field><field name="subject">Women New Zealand Auckland Biography</field><field name="subject">Photography Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photography New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Camera Clubs</field><field name="subject">Visual Culture</field><field name="subject">Amateur Photography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Photography)</field><field name="subject">Women Photographers New Zealand Biography</field><field name="subject">Slides (Transparencies)</field><field name="subject">Tourism New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Leisure Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Community Life New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Family New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Photographic Society of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Onehunga (Auckland NZ) History</field><field name="subject">Automobiles Social Aspects New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the molecular complexes that regulate the G2/M checkpoint of the eukaryotic cell cycle</field><field name="creator">Collings, Melanie</field><field name="description">The cell cycle is one of the fundamental processes in nature, and is primarily concerned with the faithful replication of cellular contents, followed by even division to produce two identical daughter cells. It is made up of five discrete biochemical steps, comprising the interphase (G1, S and G2) and the mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis), with two major regulatory checkpoints at G1 and G2. The focus of this research is the G2 checkpoint, which ensures the successful achievement of DNA replication, prior to the initiation of mitosis. Arrest or progression is principally mediated by the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex; phosphorylation of CDK1 by wee1 kinase prevents progression to mitosis, and subsequent dephosphorylation by the CDC25 phosphatases, initially the B isoform, leads to mitotic onset.  The aim of this research was the biophysical and/or biochemical characterisation of the molecular complexes that form at the G2 checkpoint to regulate entry into mitosis. CDK1 and cyclin B1 were separately expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex was also expressed and purified, incorporating either full length wee1 or a truncated version from which the N-terminal domain of wee1 was deleted. Both exhibited wee1 kinase activity, at equivalent levels, p&lt;0.001, with a 2.4 fold increase in kinase activity when wee1 is bound by 14-3-3&#946;, p&gt;0.001. Tryptic digestion of the complex indicated that its architecture was likely to be flexible and open, particularly within the N-terminal domain of wee1. CD analyses indicated that the wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex was folded, with 30-40% &#945;-helical content and 10-20% &#946;-sheet content. Dissociation experiments were unsuccessful, however, indicating a high strength of interaction between wee1 and 14-3-3&#946;. The empirical stoichiometry of the complex was determined as 1:1; subsequent native molecular weight determination suggested that the minimal functional unit is likely to be a 2:2 wee1/14-3-3&#946; arrangement. It was proposed that the structural architecture of this complex may be similar to the serotonin N-acetyltransferase/14-3-3&#950; complex. Experiments to determine the structure experimentally, using either TEM or x-ray crystallography, were unsuccessful, as the complex appeared to exhibit a high degree of flexibility in solution.  CDC25B was also expressed and purified, and was found to co-purify with a putative Sf9 14-3-3 protein. Consequently, it was re-cloned to co-express with 14-3-3&#946;, and subsequent analysis of the resulting CDC25B/14-3-3&#946; complex indicated that the empirical stoichiometry was 1:1, with the functional organization likely to be a 2:2 arrangement. It was proposed that the structural arrangement of this complex is most likely to be similar to that of the wee1/14-3-3&#946; complex.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering the past, thinking of the present: Historic commemorations in New Zealand and Northern Ireland, 1940-1990</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Helen Alexandra</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses and compares two historic commemorations in Northern Ireland with two in New Zealand, in the period from 1940 to 1990. These commemorations are the Twelfth of July and Remembrance Sunday in Northern Ireland, and Waitangi Day and Anzac Day in New Zealand. Examination of these commemorations has revealed several patterns. In the commemorations studied in this thesis, levels of public adherence generally depended on the extent to which the values that the commemoration symbolised were seen as threatened or highly needed. The commemorations which reaffirmed compelling values tended to enjoy higher levels of public support than those expressing values which were seen as either unnecessary or unthreatened. In both countries, historic commemorations were capable of uniting communities behind core values. However, in cases where there was no general agreement on what those values were or what they meant, commemorations frequently became sites of division and conflict. All four commemorations were regularly used by organisers and participants to express views on contemporary political and social issues and, on several occasions in both countries, different groups battled for the control of particular commemorations. In both countries, increased levels of social conflict often led to the increased use of the past as a rhetorical device. The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that these historic commemora&#172;tions derived more of their meaning from their contemporary context than from the historical events which they commemorated. In particular, how the public viewed and understood the values symbolised and reaffirmed by the commemorations strongly affected their levels of support. People were most likely to observe the commem-orations when they were seen as symbolising values which were widely adhered to and seen as threatened or urgently needed. The historic commemorations examined in this thesis were often strongly affected by contemporary events which were seen as relating, positively or negatively, to the values which the commemorations embodied.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commemorations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Northern Ireland</field><field name="subject">Waitangi Day</field><field name="subject">Anzac Day</field><field name="subject">Remembrance Sunday</field><field name="subject">Twelfth of July</field><field name="subject">Orange Order</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A "stupendous attraction" : materialising a Tibetan Buddhist contact zone in rural Australia</field><field name="creator">McAra, Sally, 1967-</field><field name="description">When people, ideas or things migrate across cultural milieux, many opportunities for cultural transformation arise. The focal point of this thesis is a large stupa/temple (Great Stupa) being built at Atisha Centre, a Buddhist retreat near Bendigo in Australia, by members of an international organisation called the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT). I approach the planning, promotion and construction of the stupa as an instance of the transplantation of religious material culture, arguing that Atisha Centre and particularly the stupa play a constitutive role by acting as a contact zone (Pratt 1992). Since the Centre is a site of alternate social ordering in which the Buddhists attempt to actualise their universalist ideals in a specific place, I also conceptualise it as a heterotopia (Foucault 1986, Hetherington 1997). The contact zone entails engagement between different socio-cultural domains. One of the key domains is the globalisation of contemporary Buddhism and its permutations in new locales. Stemming from this is the question of how the Buddhists and their imported material culture engage with wider concerns such as various non-FPMT Buddhist, Anglo- Australian and Aboriginal locals&#8217; responses towards the transplantation of a Tibetan temple into a rural Australian locale. The complex and shifting relationships between different kinds of Buddhism feature in relation to different ideas about the value of holy objects. The FPMT conforms to the enlightenment-oriented ideals of &#8220;Buddhist modernism&#8221; (McMahan 2008) but appears to depart from it in its pronounced emphasis on merit-making and holy objects. However, the project&#8217;s proponents consider the stupa a method for enacting their enlightenment aspirations. I attribute the stupa project&#8217;s relatively smooth passage through local planning application procedures to proponents&#8217; prior social and cultural capital, which I link to positive public perceptions of Buddhism, aspirations for Bendigo to become more culturally diverse and the economic development the stupa is expected to bring. The literally concrete structure of the stupa not only provides Buddhists with a tangible focal point for their ideals, but also serves as a vehicle for the establishment of Tibetan Buddhism in a new land.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadband teleportation and entanglement in cascaded open quantum systems</field><field name="creator">Noh, Changsuk</field><field name="description">Quantum optics provides powerful means to probe quantum mechanics. In this thesis, we study various aspects of quantum phenomena arising in quantum optical systems. Part I studies broadband quantum teleportation. After presenting three different methods of analyzing the standard teleportation protocol, we study the interplay between various bandwidths in determining the fidelity of a broadband quantum field teleportation. Explicit formulae for the degrees of first- and secondorder coherence for the teleportation of resonance fluorescence are derived for this purpose. Part II studies entanglement arising in cascaded open quantum (optical) systems. First, a detailed laser model is produced within quantum trajectory theory to study the total decoherence rate of a laser-driven qubit. Second, using this model, we address the issue of laser quantum state, viewed in connection with separability of the laser-driven-qubit system. Third, a measure of entanglement within quantum trajectory theory called &#8216;Contextual Entanglement&#8217; is calculated for a few simple systems and compared with the &#8216;Entanglement of Formation&#8217;. Lastly, we introduce a method to quantify entanglement (based on the contextual entanglement) between a source and the field it emits, which we call the &#8216;Entanglement Spectrum&#8217;.

After the study these following conclusions were found: 1. There is an effect of material mechanical properties on the strength of a cracked body where material orthotropy exists. The degree of the effect depends on the loading configuration, crack(s) location and size and ratio(s) of material properties. 2. Collinear cracks across a slab can be simply treated as an edge cracked slab if the pitch of collinear cracks is three times of the length of a crack. 3. Strength of a finger jointed specimen is related to components material properties and finger profile. 4. A specimen made by high quality grade timber jointed to low grade timber usually has its strength is neither increased nor decreased, unless the outer finger root is located on the component made from high quality grade timber. 5. When a finger jointed specimen failed at the finger joint, the fracture mostly happened at the outer finger root, a small proportion had the fracture initiate from the first inner tooth root. Propagation of fracture either went straight up first or went straight inclined first. As long as the length of a shouldered specimen increases, the straight up fracture propagation, F11 failure mode, becomes more unlikely. 6. Linear fracture mechanics can be applied to a finger jointed specimen but the implementation would not be simple. The direct implementation of linear fracture mechanics to finger jointed problems may lead to the unsatisfaction results and not be useful for practice. 7. Applied statistics to the test results, and the characteristic strength of a finger jointed specimen was evaluated. The lower tolerance limits of modulus of rupture for different finger profile finger jointed specimens is greater than the lower tolerance limits of timber grade F5. Finger jointing applied to lower grade timber will not reduce its lower tolerance limit (L.T.L.) but increase it. Apparent fracture toughness then was calculated based on the characteristic strength, and it was related to the thickness of a finger or length of a shoulder.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Virtual Chinatown: the diasporic mediasphere of Chinese migrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Li, Phoebe Hairong</field><field name="description">This is a study of the social dynamics of the current Chinese migrant community in New Zealand through a critical analysis of the Auckland-based Chinese-language media. It combines two research fields, international migration studies and media studies, to conceptualise Chinese-language media as a specific type of alternative media in contemporary New Zealand. The Chinese population in New Zealand has rapidly increased through immigration since the passage of the 1987 Immigration Act; Chinese now comprise 3.4% of the New Zealand population, and a wide variety of Chinese-language media have accordingly thrived in New Zealand. In contrast to New Zealand mainstream media, these Chinese media serve the specific needs and interests of newly arrived and only minimally acculturated Chinese migrants. The research was conducted in three phases: quantitative and qualitative data were acquired from the content of Chinese-language media during the period of the 2005 New Zealand general election; qualitative data were obtained from focus groups and interviews with members of the Chinese audience subsequent to the election; qualitative data were generated from Chinese media personnel. The findings suggest that these Chinese-language media closely reflect and depict recent PRC Chinese migrants&#8217; perceptions of New Zealand and aspirations towards their new life in the host country. Within the global context of the Chinese diaspora in historical and contemporary times, this research also introduces a new angle for exploring the socio-economic impacts of China as a rising superpower on New Zealand and the Pacific Rim.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370500 Demography::370502 Migration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420304 Screen and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of yeast genes involved in sauvignon blanc aroma development</field><field name="creator">Harsch, Michael Johannes</field><field name="description">The grape variety Sauvignon Blanc (SB) is the flagship of New Zealand&#8217;s wine industry and accounted for over 75 % of the value of total wine exports in 2008. Two volatile thiols, 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH) and 3-mercaptohexyl-acetate (3MHA), reminiscent of grapefruit and passion fruit respectively, are critical for the main varietal characters in New Zealand SB. These aromatic thiols are not present in the grape juice, but are synthesized and released by the yeast during alcoholic fermentation from non-aromatic precursors. The aim of this work was to elucidate the underlying genetics of volatile thiol synthesis in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during alcoholic fermentation of grape juice. A gene-deletion strategy was chosen for the investigation of putative genes influencing 3MH and 3MHA release. The first part of this thesis optimized fermentation conditions in grape-juice-based media, which enabled auxotrophic laboratory strains, derived from S288C, to ferment grape juice to completion with high efficiency. Key steps to achieving this goal were the supplementation of the grape juice with higher than recommended amounts of amino acids, which increased the fermentation rate of auxotrophic yeast strains. Lysine auxotrophic strains especially benefited from this measure. In combination with the dilution of SB grape juice by 25 % with synthetic grape juice without sugars, the auxotrophic laboratory yeast BY4743 was able to metabolize all sugars in the grape juice-based media in a time frame similar to that of a commercial wine yeast. The key properties of the resulting wine were comparable to wine made with a commercial wine yeast under the same conditions. In the second part, these newly developed fermentation conditions were employed to screen 69 single-gene deletion strains in the laboratory yeast background BY4743. The list of the 69 candidate genes was compiled by combining existing knowledge about thiol production in yeast with the mining of several biological databases. Screening of the single-gene deletions revealed 17 genes which caused biologically relevant increases or decreases in volatile thiol production, but none abolished it. The majority of the 17 genes were related to the sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in yeast. A subset of these thiol-influencing genes were also deleted in a wine yeast, and were overexpressed in both wine yeast and laboratory yeast, to gain more insight in their regulatory effects. The findings confirmed that sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in yeast were important in regulating 3MH and 3MHA synthesis. Different sulfur and nitrogen sources were added to the grape must prior to fermentation and their effect on thiol release was studied. It was found that nitrogen sources urea and DAP, as well as, the sulfur compound S-ethyl-L-cysteine (SEC) increased 3MH and 3MHA concentrations in the resulting wines. The addition of cysteine to grape juice fermented with wine yeast deleted in genes CYS3 and CYS4 more than doubled total thiol production. Mapping approaches to investigate thiol production in yeast were employed in the final part of this thesis. Genetically mapped F2 progeny of a cross between a low thiol-producing yeast strain and a high-thiol producer were screened for their thiol phenotype. The 3MH and 3MHA phenotypes across 48 screened F2 progeny resembled normal distributions, indicating a quantitative trait. Subsequent mapping identified a locus on chromosome 14 with a small effect on the 3MHA phenotype, but no obvious candidate genes were evident in the region. Another approach to investigate the evolution of volatile thiols in yeast included the use of SEC, a thiol compound resembling the cysteinylated precursor of 3MH, as a sole nitrogen source in a yeast growth assay. It was found that most wine yeast, European yeast isolates and laboratory yeasts could utilize SEC as a nitrogen source, whereas various other S. cerevisiae isolates could not. Crosses between three pairs of Sec- and Sec+ yeast strains strongly indicated that this trait was monogenically inherited. However, no direct correlation between the SEC phenotype and volatile release could be observed. Genetic mapping experiments in one SEC-segregating yeast population linked this SEC phenotype to the leu2-D0 deletion in a cross between a Leu+ and Leu- yeast strain. It was shown that leucine auxotrophy most likely caused the Sec- phenotype. In a second F2 population of a cross between prototrophic Sec+ and Sec- strains, strong linkage was established to a region on chromosome 6 containing two candidate genes, DUG1 and IRC7. DUG1 was proved not to be the cause of the SEC phenotype, whereas IRC7 remains a strong candidate gene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">volatile thiols</field><field name="subject">Sauvignon Blanc</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">genes</field><field name="subject">3-mercaptohexan-1-ol</field><field name="subject">3-mercaptohexyl-acetate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knots and quandles</field><field name="creator">Budden, Stephen Mark</field><field name="description">Quandles were introduced to Knot Theory in the 1980s as an almost complete algebraic invariant for knots and links. Like their more basic siblings, groups, they are difficult to distinguish so a major challenge is to devise means for determining when two quandles having different presentations are really different. This thesis addresses this point by studying algebraic aspects of quandles.  Following what is mainly a recapitulation of existing work on quandles, we firstly investigate how a link quandle is related to the quandles of the individual components of the link. Next we investigate coset quandles. These are motivated by the transitive action of the operator, associated and automorphism group actions on a given quandle, allowing techniques of permutation group theory to be used. We will show that the class of all coset quandles includes the class of all Alexander quandles; indeed all group quandles.  Coset quandles are used in two ways: to give representations of connected quandles, which include knot quandles; and to provide target quandles for homomorphism invariants which may be useful in enabling one to distinguish quandles by counting homomorphisms onto target quandles.  Following an investigation of the information loss in going from the fundamental quandle of a link to the fundamental group, we apply our techniques to calculations for the figure eight knot and braid index two knots and involving lower triangular matrix groups.  The thesis is rounded out by two appendices, one giving a short table of  knot quandles for knots up to six crossings and the other a computer program for computing the homomorphism invariants.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knot theory</field><field name="subject">quandles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pressure assisted thermal sterilization: a novel means of processing foods</field><field name="creator">Wimalaratne, Sajith Kanchana</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates a newly developed and patented technology for its ability to inactivate spore- forming bacteria and non-spore-forming microorganisms. This new technology &#8220;Pressure Assisted Thermal Sterilization&#169;&#8221; (PATS) is based on the theory of the thermal expansion of liquids. The efficiency of inactivating spore-forming and non-spore-forming microorganisms by PATS was compared with the thermal treatment alone. A combination treatment consisting of high pressure processing and gaseous carbon dioxide was also investigated for its ability to inactivate bacterial spores in model and real food matrices. The structural damage caused by treatments to the spores and non-spore-forming bacteria was assessed by scanning electron microscopy.  Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores suspended in Milli-Q water, UHT milk and pumpkin soup, treated by PATS were found to have significantly lower decimal reduction times (D values) compared with the thermal treatment alone. Spores suspended in UHT milk were more heat resistant compared with those in Milli-Q water and pumpkin soup. Bacillus cereus spores suspended in Milli-Q water and pumpkin soup treated with PATS were more effectively inactivated compared with spores treated by the thermal treatment alone. Clostridium botulinum spores in saline buffer subjected to PATS treatment were inactivated more effectively compared with the thermal treatment alone. Overall, the results show that PATS was a better processing technique for inactivation of bacterial spores compared with thermal treatment alone. However, PATS had no added benefit in inactivating the non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells compared with the thermal treatment. A shelf life study showed that B. cereus spores in pumpkin soup retained a low spore count (&lt;5 LogCFU/mL) for approximately 40 days in 30oC storage after treatment with PATS. No additional degradation of colour pigments of pumpkin soup and model pumpkin juice was observed following PATS compared with the thermal treatment. Spore-forming microorganisms can be resistant to pressure treatment alone, which limits the application of high pressure processing (HPP). Therefore, a combination approach was investigated. The mechanism of inactivating spores by combining HPP with other treatments is that the pressure assists in spore germination. Then a secondary treatment (thermal or CO2 gas) can be used to inactivate the germinated spores. A combined application of HPP and a consecutive CO2 treatment was investigated for the efficiency of spore inactivation. Results showed that HPP (200 MPa for 30 min) followed by a CO2 treatment inactivated Bacillus subtilis 168 in nutrient broth, tomato juice and liquid whole egg by 2.5, 1.0 and 1.5 LogCFU/mL respectively. These results indicated that this technique is inadequate for practical use. Scanning electron micrographs showed that pressure processing of B. subtilis 168 and B. subtilis natto spores resulted in deformation of the spore structure. This structural deformation of spores may have been due to water absorption during HPP and subsequent release upon decompression. PATS treated G. stearothermophilus and B. cereus spores were more severely damaged compared with the same spores which underwent thermal treatment alone. However, the extent to which E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells were damaged by both PATS and thermal treatment was similar.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High Pressure Processing</field><field name="subject">Pressure Assisted Thermal Sterilization</field><field name="subject">Food Processing</field><field name="subject">Novel Food Processing Technologies</field><field name="subject">Combined High Pressure Processing and Carbon Dioxide Treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An unblinking gaze: on the philosophy of the Marquis de Sade</field><field name="creator">Roche, Geoffrey T.</field><field name="description">Throughout the 20th Century, a number of philosophers, writers, artists and film makers have implied that there is some profound significance to the work of Donatien Alphonse Fran&#231;ois, the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814). The project at hand is to evaluate the claim that Sade, in some sense, is a philosopher, and to assess what his philosophy amounts to. There are two aspects to this task. Firstly, I will consider the various philosophical interpretations of Sade&#8217;s work. This part of the study will serve as a guide into the Sadeian labyrinth, and will establish some of the more central interpretive themes, in particular the claim that Sade&#8217;s thought anticipates that of the Nazis, or that he brings early Modern thought to its logical conclusion. Secondly, I will inquire into Sade&#8217;s writings themselves. Of particular interest are Sade&#8217;s thoughts concerning the nature of sexuality, psychology, and the human condition in general, his critique of conventional morality, and his description of the nature of power.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of BZP and TFMPP &#8211; &#8216;party pill&#8217; drugs</field><field name="creator">Antia, Ushtana</field><field name="description">Benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) are recreational drugs and the major constituents of a number of 'party pills'. Previous studies of these drugs have indicated that they may be metabolised by hepatic enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family. However, the metabolism, pharmacokinetic properties and drug interactions of these drugs are poorly understood. This thesis aimed to develop and apply an analytical method to the detection of these drugs, to investigate their in vitro and in vivo biotransformation, to describe their pharmacokinetic properties in humans and describe the potential for drug-drug interactions. An analytical method consisting of a reversed phase HPLC system coupled with MS using an Agilent Zorbax CI8 HPLC column (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 &#956;m) with guard column (C18, 4.6 x 10 mm, 5 &#956;m) at 20 &#176;C and a mobile phase of ammonium formate buffer (pH 4.5, 0.01 M, solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with a phase gradient and total run time of 15 minutes was developed and validated for the detection of BZP and TFMPP plus three hydroxylated metabolites in plasma. In vitro inhibition assays with human liver preparations were used to study the metabolism of these drugs. By using inhibitors quinidine, furafylline and troleandomycin it was found that CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 metabolise both BZP and TFMPP. CYP2D6 poor metaboliser status was shown to compromise metabolism of TFMPP both in vitro and in vivo. For the human pharmacokinetic study, three groups of seven healthy human participants were dosed with either BZP HCI (200 mg) or TFMPP HCl (60 mg) or both drugs (100 mg ofBZP HCl and 30 mg ofTFMPP HCl). BZP and TFMPP reached maximum plasma concentrations of 262 ng/mL and 24.1 ng/mL at 75 minutes and 90 minutes respectively, and were cleared from the plasma of participants within 24 hr. In vitro and in vivo interactions were evident in this data, most notably the in vivo inhibition of the hydroxylation of each drug in the presence of the other. In summary, this thesis presents the results of some of the first studies on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of these drugs in humans and sets the stage for future studies on the pharmacology of these commonly-used recreational drugs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of post-aerobic exercise nutrition on protein turnover and mitochondrial biogenesis</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Cheryl</field><field name="description">The desire to age well is a common goal among the human population. How to do so is therefore, a popular question. One theory of ageing involves the accumulation of damage to mitochondrial protein and the subsequent loss of function the damage causes. Increasing the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, a variable that declines with advancing age, is one way to improve quality of life in the twilight years. A review of literature lead to a multi-level approach, with measurements of protein synthesis made at the whole body, muscle, and molecular levels. An acute bout of aerobic exercise, followed by feeding, two factors which have a positive effect on the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, was used. Adaptations to a period of exercise training are mediated by the accumulation of proteins due to each acute exercise bout, and so an acute intervention was postulated to be indicative of changes expected over the long term. A stable isotope infusion combined with sampling of breath, blood, and muscle was used to determine the rate of whole body protein synthesis in 12 older adults. Intracellular signalling for mitochondrial and whole body protein synthesis was examined using RT-quantitative PCR and Western blotting in eleven young adults. The rate of post-exercise whole body protein synthesis was 19% greater over the first four hours of post-exercise recovery, in subjects receiving a protein-plus-carbohydrate drink immediately after a bout of cycling than in those receiving a carbohydrate-only drink (p = 0.001). The same trend was revealed in signalling for whole body protein synthesis and the abundance of cytochrome c, a mitochondrial protein, although these results were not statistically significant (p = 0.2). In contrast there was a strong, albeit also statistically insignificant, tendency for signalling for mitochondrial protein synthesis to be higher in the skeletal muscle of subjects receiving a carbohydrate-only drink after a bout of cycling (p = 0.06). The exercise and feeding intervention described in this thesis may provide a means to enhance the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis in older individuals and, in so doing, improve the quality of their old age.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomically-based, subject-specific modelling of lower limb motion during gait</field><field name="creator">Oberhofer, Katja</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering::291504 Biomechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading storybooks in Vietnamese families as a language intervention: an activity analysis</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thanh-Binh Thi</field><field name="description">Leont'ev understood activity as a mutually influenced process between the subject and the objective world. This process makes changes in both the subject and the objective world. He described activity as a system with its own structure which is created by its basic components and interrelationships among these components and the environment in which the activity exists (Leont'ev, 1978, 1981). In this research, an adapted model of Leont'ev's activity psychology, incorporating Gal'perin's stage model of formation of mental action and concepts (Gal'perin, 1992), and other developmental concepts (Bronfenbronner, 1979; Bruner, 1977; McNaughton, 1995; Rogoff, 1990, 2003; Vygotsky, 1978), was employed for design, implementation and evaluation of a family storybook reading activity intervention. This new approach of joint activity to early language intervention is the original contribution of the present research. This research aimed to describe and demonstrate effects of the intervention on individual children's vocabulary and comprehension development, before school and over the transition to school. A semi longitudinal set of case studies combined with a single-subject experimental design was chosen. Less well educated Vietnamese parents were provided with support, in order to develop their children's language, through storybook reading. Six families in Vietnam received storybooks, a workshop with shared reading techniques, a DVD of family shared reading samples, and home coaching sessions.  The data from the Baseline, Intervention and Maintenance phases showed that the parents made changes in their understanding of: Family shared reading benefits, how to select high-quality storybooks and how to set reading goals suitable to their own child's ability and interest. They also improved their shared reading techniques. Through the joint reading activity, the children's vocabulary increased significantly, especially in using expressive words. Changes in narrative comprehension were recorded. This progress was sustained over a period of 22 weeks after the intervention. The findings provide evidence of the completeness and generativeness of the theoretical framework for family literacy education. The model acted as a tool to guide a family literacy intervention. The research population was small and further studies in different literacy learning and teaching contexts are needed to enhance its practical implications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of conducting polymer-based antioxidant packaging materials</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Chyong Fang</field><field name="description">Antioxidants are commonly used as preservatives for protecting foodstuffs from oxidation. Packaging is believed not only to increase the economic value of products but also improve their qualities. Conducting polymers (CPs), such as soluble polyaniline and soluble polypyrrole, have been reported to exhibit antioxidant activity. Development of conducting polymer containing packaging materials, with antioxidant properties, is therefore the focus of this project. Polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) powders were prepared using various amounts of the oxidant ammonium persulfate (APS). Spectroscopic methods, including IR and Raman, were used to identify the structures of the CP powders synthesized at various APS levels. It was found that a high level of APS led to overoxidation of the CP powders. The conductivity and doping level of the CP powders formed using higher concentrations of the APS oxidant were found to be lower than those prepared using low concentrations of APS, which might be due to overoxidation, damaging the CP structures during the preparation processes. The antioxidant activity of PPy, PANI and PEDOT powders were evaluated using the DPPH and ABTS assays. The results showed that CP powders synthesized at a high concentration of APS presented lower free radical quenching effects, likely also due to overoxidation. The optimum initial ratio of APS to monomer for the synthesis of CP powders with a superior DPPH free radical scavenging was found to be around 0.5 for PPy, 1.5 for PANI and 1.0 for PEDOT, and the antioxidant ranking of the CP powders was as follows: PANI1.5 &gt; PPy0.5 &gt; PEDOT1.0. The reduced forms of PPy, PANI and PEDOT exhibited better radical scavenging abilities than the as-prepared powders. PANI nanotubes, synthesized at high pH, was also found to exhibit stronger free radical scavenging activity than the regular granular PANI formed under acidic conditions. Structural changes of PANI powders after reaction with free radicals were observed in IR and XPS spectra, showing an increase in the ratio of imine (C=N) to amine (C-N) units. PANI EC films were prepared using a solution method and the antioxidant capacity of the PANI EC films are examined using the ORAC assay. The results showed efficient peroxyl free radical scavenging activity of the PANI EC films. A very good correlation between the ORAC response and the area of tested film was also observed, indicating a homogenous dispersion of active PANI powder across the film. Similar to the results obtained from the DPPH and ABTS assays, reduced PANI presented greater peroxyl radical scavenging activity than the as-prepared powders. The influence of the PANI EC films on the oxidation of Ropufa oil was determined by peroxide value (PV) measurement. After incubation at 60oC for several days, the oil stored in the presence of the PANI EC film was found to exhibit a lower PV than in the absence of a CP film, indicating that the conducting polymer is effective in inhibiting oxidation of fish oil.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracking Heaphy: travels in the New Zealand landscape</field><field name="creator">Walker, Celia</field><field name="description">Charles Heaphy was a nineteenth-century artist, surveyor, explorer, politician and soldier, whose work was inextricably linked with the colonisation process in New Zealand. Heaphy&#8217;s views of the landscape were framed by pictorial and social interests, and his travels were motivated by personal and professional concerns. This study focuses on specific journeys largely undertaken early in Heaphy&#8217;s career, due to the wealth of material available to document those times. The journeys assessed in detail are: his travels on the New Zealand Company ship the Tory; his exploratory expeditions in Taranaki, the Nelson region and the West Coast of the South Island; and his work with the geologist Hochstetter. Heaphy&#8217;s paintings, drawings and lithographs are examined alongside his published and unpublished texts in order to arrive at a more complex understanding of his oeuvre. The relationship between Heaphy&#8217;s work and that of his contemporaries such as William Fox and Edward Jerningham Wakefield is also considered. This study investigates Heaphy&#8217;s work within the context of recent travel and landscape theory, and uses these ideas to look at his representations as products of the colonial world. Alongside such post-colonial considerations is a discussion of his use of numerous pre-existing genres and conventions, and how those relate to the meanings of his depicted and described landscapes. Some of those conventions, such as the picturesque and the sublime, affect both visual and written material; others he utilised, such as in his hunting still-life and bird paintings, were exclusively pictorial forms. It is argued that interpreting his work from a single theoretical perspective would be reductive. The intertwining of these tropes with his actual experiences of place and his underlying political motivations make possible multi-layered readings of his works. By examining these various aspects of his travels and ways of recording, this study aims to contribute to the discourse about colonial landscapes, and the cultural construction of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of delayed release granules for diphacinone: formulation for the control of brushtail possum in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chan, Judy</field><field name="description">Background and Aim: The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus velpecula) causes more damage to the environment than any other vertebrate species in New Zealand. The use of poison remains the main method for possum population control. Diphacinone is an anticoagulant that produces toxic effects by inhibiting the production of vitamin K&#8211;dependent coagulation factors which lead to profuse haemorrhage and eventually, death. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the potential of diphacinone as a toxin for the control of possum population in New Zealand. Methods: The preformulation of diphacinone included the development and validation of an analytical method, spectral identification, investigation of melting behaviour, solubility, and the determination of ionisation constant. The permeability of diphacinone across the ileal tissue of possum was assessed using a modified Ussing chamber model. Diphacinone granules were developed to prolong drug release and retention by in vitro dissolution and tensile testing. A factorial study was employed to optimise the granulation process by identifying significant process variables that influenced the yield percentage, size distribution and water uptake of granules.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does M&#257;ori Representation Matter?: an analysis of the relationship between M&#257;ori descriptive and substantive political representation in parliament and local government</field><field name="creator">Summersby, Kim Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 12/2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Columnar cuff, anal transitional zone and ileal pouch mucosa in restorative proctocolectomy</field><field name="creator">Thompson-Fawcett, Mark W</field><field name="description">The formation of a pelvic ileal reservoir or pouch for patients requiring a proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has gained rapid favour over recent years. The operation has evolved by empiric practice with the progressive refinement of operative technique. There is still debate over whether to retain or remove the anal transitional zone (ATZ). This debate relates to concern about the neoplastic and inflammatory potential of diseased mucosa if retained in the anal canal. Similarly the chronic inflammatory changes observed in ileal pouch mucosa have raised the possibility that neoplasia may be a long term consequence of forming the ileum into a pouch. This thesis investigates these issues. The work begins with a review of the literature on the ATZ and its importance in restorative proctocolectomy. Following this a detailed study of the micro anatomy of the anal canal is carried out on 28 anal canals. The median span of the ATZ was found to be only 4.5 millimetres and it contains almost no columnar epithelium. However an important area termed the columnar cuff was identified. In a patient who does not have a mucosectomy, the columnar cuff constitutes a span of diseased Columnar epithelium extending over 1 5 to 2.5 cm in the upper anal canal. Long term concerns need to focus on the columnar cuff rather than the ATZ. The columnar cuff and ATZ in 113 patients with an ileal pouch has been studied. These patients had an examination with the intention of biopsying the anal canal and ileal pouch to study the ATZ and columnar cuff. It was possible to obtain a successful biopsy of the columnar cuff in 72% of cases. The technique of staining for the small bowel brush border enzyme sucrase isomaltase has been developed and shown to reliably distinguish between pouch mucosa with villous atrophy and columnar cuff mucosa. The same group of patients was followed over a 2.5 year period and 9% were shown to have symptomatic &#8216;cuffitis&#8217;. A histological scoring system is described and a diagnostic triad of symptoms, endoscopic inflammation and acute inflammation on histology is put forward as a way to diagnose cuffitis. The same 113 patients had columnar cuff biopsies examined for dysplasia and aneuploidy at a mean of 2.5 years after pouch formation and 10.1 years after the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. No dysplasia was found but one patient had aneuploidy in the columnar cuff. The final part of the work focuses on investigating the risk of neoplasia in ileal pouches. This work draws on a large cohort of 1221 patients with an ileal pouch and selects out a potentially higher risk group for pouch neoplasia. 106 patients who had a pouch for ulcerative colitis were selected, including 34 with chronic pouchitis. In addition 33 patients who had a pouch for FAP were studied. In the ulcerative colitis group one patient was found to have low grade dysplasia and aneuploidy and a further two patients aneuploidy. The risk of neoplasia in an ileal pouch for ulcerative colitis appears low and chronic pouchitis was not identified as a particular risk factor. In contrast adenomatous polyps were found in the ileal pouch of 42% of patients with FAP. It appears that forming the terminal ileum into a reservoir promotes the formation of ileal polyps. In conclusion forming the ileum into a pelvic reservoir to maintain continence appears to be a safe procedure with medium term follow up. It will be important to continue to gather data to establish the natural history of an ileal pouch. In the interim a level of follow up and surveillance for some groups of patients may be wise.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of chronic pelvic pain in women</field><field name="creator">Farquhar, Cynthia, 1956-</field><field name="description">Recent studies have demonstrated that 84% of women suffering from unexplained pelvic pain have dilated pelvic veins. Such appearances are generally considered to be evidence of &#8216;pelvic congestion&#8217;. Venographic studies of women without pain did not show these appearances. Management of pelvic congestion is considered difficult as there are few therapies currently available. Psychotherapy has been previously shown to be successful in the management of a number of painful conditions including women with chronic pelvic pain. Ovarian suppression with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) has also been shown to reduce both venogram and pain scores. The first hypothesis of this thesis was that women with chronic pelvic pain in association with venographic evidence of pelvic congestion could be treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate and that longer term benefit could be obtained with the concurrent use of psychotherapy. The second hypothesis was that treatment with MPA will lower levels of pituitary gonadotrophins, the ovarian hormones, the karyopyknotic index (vaginal cytology) and reduce the dimensions of the uterus, endometrium, ovaries and pelvic veins. This thesis presents the results of a randomised controlled trial comparing two different treatment approaches; psychotherapy and ovarian suppression using MPA. One hundred and two women with pelvic congestion were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups; MPA, MPA and psychotherapy, placebo, and placebo and psychotherapy. Women were treated for four months and thereafter followed up regularly for 9 months with pain assessments, pelvic ultrasound scanning and hormone measurements. Women treated with MPA showed a significant benefit in terms of a reduction in pain scores, with 73% of women reporting an improvement compared with 33% of those in the non-MPA groups. After 9 months therapy no clear drug effect emerged. Fifty percent of women in the placebo group were improved at the end of follow up. Those women who received MPA had significant reductions in the uterine cross-sectionnal area, endometrial thickness, oestradiol, testosterone and luteinising hormone levels. Medical therapy with MPA was shown to be a useful first line therapy for women with pain associated with demonstrable pelvic congestion.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomical and radiological basis of extrafascial excision of the rectum</field><field name="creator">Bissett, Ian Peter</field><field name="description">The operation of extrafascial excision dissects directly on the rectal fascia propria to remove the rectum and mesorectum within an intact fascial envelope. The studies contained in this thesis revolve around the recent finding that if a rectal cancer is contained within the fascia propria and the rectum is removed by extrafascial excision then local recurrence of the cancer will be exceptional. The thesis is presented in 4 parts as anatomical, radiological, clinical and operative sections. Gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, post-mortem dissections and axial cross sectional anatomy images were used to define the anatomy of the fascia propria. It is shown to be a 150&#956;m thick, collagen membrane completely surrounding the mesorectum. The hypogastric nerves and pelvic plexuses are embedded in the parietal fascia separated from the mesorectum and fascia propria by a loose areolar layer. A computerised three-dimensional model of the rectum and mesorectum has been generated based on 1mm axial cross sections of the anatomy of the area and axial MR scans offering the potential to visualise the rectum in its mesorectum preoperatively. A systematic review of preoperative radiological staging has been reported comparing endorectal ultrasound, CT and MR imaging. The ability to determine the relation of the tumour to the fascia propria preoperatively has, however, not been previously explored. Cadaveric studies in this thesis have demonstrated that the fascia propria can be identified by axial CT and MR imaging. In a consecutive series of 43 patients with rectal cancer preoperative MR accurately predicted the relation of the deepest tumour invasion to this fascia. In the third section extrafascial excision has been compared with conventional surgery at a single institution over a 16 year period. In a study population of 262 rectal cancer patients operated on with curative intent, extrafascial excision had a significantly lower local recurrence rate and prolonged cancer-free survival without an increase in cost or complication rates. Based on these studies a new description of the operation of extrafascial excision of the rectum is presented in the fourth section with emphasis on preventing complications. This thesis has provided a new understanding of the surgical anatomy of the rectum and a novel management protocol for rectal cancer based on the relationship of the tumour to the fascia propria as detected by preoperative MR imaging.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cerebral blood flow velocity variability in very low birthweight infants</field><field name="creator">Coughtrey, Heather</field><field name="description">Short-term variability in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the VLBW infant largely relates to respiratory influence. Extreme variability may be a poor prognostic indicator. Few have studied cohorts of babies in this regard. I sequentially studied a consecutive cohort of unselected VLBW infants, to determine the frequency of respiratory influence on CBFVV and to identify factors associated with its occurrence. Doppler CBFV, arterial BP and respiratory signals were recorded simultaneously and spectral analysis was applied to identify a respiratory signal in BP and CBFV traces. Respiratory associated variability was present in the cerebral circulation at some time in more than half of the infants studied and was most likely in those of lowest gestational age who were hypotensive. Mortality, and cerebral morbidity as assessed by cerebral ultrasound were more common in those demonstrating a respiratory influence in CBFV. There was a strong correlation between the coefficient of variation(CV%) of BP and that of CBFV. Babies demonstrating hypotension had higher CV%s in CBFV; those who did not survive showed higher variability than survivors, but there was a wide spread of values in both groups. where the variability in CBFV was high, correlation between CBFV and BP was greater. However, no significant association was found between CV% of CBFV and brain injury, ductal patency, or sedation. Although exaggerated beat-to-beat variability in CBFV was an adverse prognostic indicator, absence of variability carried the worst prognosis. Slow variations of cerebral blood flow velocity at a frequency of 1-5 cycles per minute, previously described as a normal phenomenon, were also examined. Evolution of this variability was studied amongst those present for a month or more. Slow variations diminished with both increasing postnatal and postconceptional age, perhaps representing maturation of the balance between the two components of the autonomic nervous system. The cycle length of the slow variations was variable suggesting the presence of several low frequency components; longer recordings would be needed to resolve these. Addition of serial Doppler measurements of CBFV performed in the first week of life, did not improve prediction of an 18-month outcome obtained from ultrasound imaging alone.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of antibody, complement and immune complexes as mediators of immune-injury</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Ian James</field><field name="description">In guinea-pig nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN) induced by a sheep antibody there was minimal glomerular capillary deposition of C3 or accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) in the heterologous phase. The C4 deficient (C4d) strain developed the same injury as normal Dunkin-Hartley animals. Complement depletion with cobra venom factor, PMN depletion with nitrogen mustard or anti-PMN serum and treatment with antihistamines, aprotinin and indomethacin provided no protection. The relationship between the dose of nephrotoxic antibody and the proteinuria was similar for the &#947;1 and &#947;2 subclasses and the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of &#947;1 antibody. However, the F(ab&#8217;) and the F(ab) antibody fragments, though fixing on the GBM did not cause proteinuria. It is Concluded that the development of proteinuria in this system: is largely independent of the C/PMN system; is due to the fixation of the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of the antibody molecule; and does not depend on an intact Fc piece. In the autologous phase of NTN induced by sheep antibody to GBM in DH and C4d strain gp, &lt;50% of animals developed proteinuria at the height of the autologous antibody response despite high anti-sheep immunoglobulin titres and fixation of the gp IgG and complement in the kidneys. Only 2 of 37 animals (5.4%) developed progressive disease. In a passive model of autologous phase injury using high titre rabbit antibody to sheep IgG, proteinuria failed to occur despite fixation of up to 95&#181;g of rabbit antibody per kidney. Repeated injection of sheep nephrotoxic antibody caused a persisting nephritic syndrome but not the characteristic proliferative lesion of anti-GBM diseases in other species. Because antibody responses to the alternative complement pathway activator cobra venom factor, are T-dependent and B-mice therefore do not develop resistance to its action it was possible to examine whether renal injury occured under circumstances of protracted alternative pathway activation. After periods of up to three months, no evidence from measurements of blood urea or proteinuria or from examination with light microscopy, immunofluorescent or electron microscopy was obtained to indicate a direct nephrotoxic effect of this type of complement activation. These studies do not support the concept that glomerular injury in patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis and hypocomplementaemia from C3 nephritic factor are due to the continued activation of the alternative pathway. The clinical course and levels of anti-GBM antibody were compared in 20 patients with Goodpasture&#8217;s syndrome treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression (8 patients), immunosuppression alone (4patients) or no specific therapy (8 patients). There was a more rapid fall in the level of anti-GBM antibody and pulmonary haemorrhage was less protracted in the patients treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. In this group, one patient who presented with severe renal failure showed a marked improvement in renal function and there was no progression of disease in the four with milder renal involvement. Two of the four patients treated with immunosuppression alone and only two of the eight patients who received no specific therapy maintained normal renal function. In the group which received no specific therapy, one of the six patients who progressed to renal failure had mild renal involvement initially. There was a significant correlation between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of the morphological changes seen at renal biopsy but not between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of lung haemorrhage. The course and outcome of the disease in these patients not treated or treated with immunosuppression alone was better than that described in earlier reports of this disease, while those patients with plasma exchange and immunosuppression fared even better. An adequately stratified controled trial of immunosuppression in plasma exchange versus immunsuppression alone is justified. Immune complex (IC) levels were measured in normal subjects using the C1q solid phase, C1q deviation, C1q binding and polyethylene glycol precipitation assays. Significant changes in IC levels were seen in normals with each of the assays but the pattern of variation was not consistent between assays or subjects or in the same subject from day to day. There were no consistent changes with meals, time of day, exercise or the prior administration of prednisone. Low levels of IC appeared to be normal in plasma, but the variation in IC levels was not explained. Normal IC may well comprise mixtures of non-specific immunoglobulin aggregates, rheumatoid factor-immunoglobulin complexes, idiotype anti-idiotype complexes as well as specific antibody complexes with antigens from food, infective agents and other sources. Eighty-six patients with primary glomerulonephritis had circulating IC levels measured in 4 IC assays at the time of percutaneous renal biopsy. Patients with acute glomerulonephritis and type 1 mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis showed the greatest positivity rate overall while patients with membranous glomerulonephritis had the lowest rate. overall, just over half the patients with primary glomerulonephritis were positive in any one assay and &lt;5% in any three assays. Repeat samples taken from the same patients after an interval of some months often showed the same pattern of reactivity in the 4 assays or a return towards lower values. Thirty-one patients with proven acute myocardial infarction (MI) were studied prospectively at the time of admission to hospital and at 3, 7, and 18 days using 4 IC assays. Each assay showed an increased incidence of IC activity in MI with 76% of patients being Positive in at least one assay on one or more of the sampling days. A positive IC assay did not show a significant correlation with cardiac failure, pericarditis, post MI syndrome or previous infarction. The presence of IC was found to correlate with serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum enzymes and ESR and suggested that complexed CRP or other acute phase proteins may account for some of the IC activity found with less specific assays. The measurement of IC levels in MI has not proved helpful in the diagnosis, management or prediction of outcome in this disorder. In recipients of cadaveric renal transplants circulating IC as detected by the C1q deviation test were found in more than two thirds of patients with recent graft. IC levels were found to rise after rejection episodes and also after episodes of infection. Low or rapidly falling IC levels soon after transplantation were associated with good graft function. Sera from 4 patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) were shown to contain abnormal lipoproteins which behaved as IC. One IC lipoprotein (ICVLDL) had the density in ultracentrifugation of very low density lipoprotein, but a markedly altered electrophoretic mobility. A second IC lipoprotein (ICIDL) had the electrophoretic mobility of very low density lipoprotein but was slightly denser than low density lipoprotein on ultracentrifugation. Both the ICVLDL and ICLDL contained IgG and behaved as IC in the C1q deviation test, platelet aggregation and rheumatoid factor inhibition assays, but not in the conglutinin and C1q binding assays and the C1q solid phase assays. These differences could be due to the low densities of the ICVLDL and ICLDL. The abnormal lipoprotein IC disappeared with clinical remission in two patients and were not present in the sera of other patients with inactive or mild SLE, type 4 hyperlipidaemia or during prednisone therapy or plasma exchange for other conditions. These IC appeared to be markers of severe and active SLE.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenesis and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis</field><field name="creator">Reid, IR(Ian Reginald)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body protein loss in preoperative patients : the assessment of its impact on physiologic function and surgical risk</field><field name="creator">Windsor, John Albert</field><field name="description">The nutritional assessment of patients awaiting major abdominal surgery is important. It has been shown that malnutrition is common in such patients, but is often unrecognized. Because of the widespread availability of safe forms of nutritional therapy the task of identifying patients who warrant this therapy has become more urgent. However, current techniques used for the identification of significantly malnourished surgical patients have several important limitations. It has become increasingly evident that a fresh approach to nutritional assessement is now required. Drawing on some preliminary evidence that the loss of body protein is associated with an impairment of a range of physiologic functions, this thesis asserts that in order to improve on our ability to identify preoperative patients who are at a significantly increased risk of postoperative morbidiy and mortality because of the loss of body protein, it would be necessary to assess physiologic functions that can be easily measured, are protein dependent, and clinically relevant. Therefore, the following concept was investigated: That patients lose weight in response to disease and/or nutrient deprivation and the important component of this loss is body protein. The loss of body protein results in an impairment of important physiologic functions, which is the basis of the increased surgical risk noted in malnourished patients, and which results in the increased morbidity and mortality after major surgery. In order to investigate the inter&#173;relationships of weight loss, protein loss, impaired function and surgical risk several objective measurement techniques had to be developed in order to measure physiologic functions (respiratory function, liver function, skeletal muscle function, wound healing reaponse and psychological function). An in vivo neutron activation analysis facility was available for the direct measurement of body protein status. In addition, techniques for the clinical assessment of nutritional status, diet, and postoperative course were developed. The fundemental conclusions of these clinical studies were: [1] that the measurement of preoperative weight loss is no longer useful in identifying patients who are at an increased risk of dying following major surgery, [2] that the preoperative loss of body protein is associated with an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, [3] that the loss of body protein is associated with an impairment of clinically relevant physiologic functions including liver, skeletal muscle and respiratory function, [4] that a proportion (20 to 25%) of body protein can be determined and must be lost before there is an impairment of some important physiologic functions, [5] that plasma transferrin and prealbumin concentrations are sensitive to the adequacy of recent food intake, and are a measure of body protein status in the elective patients studied, [6] that plasma albumin concentration, in the elective patients studied, is sensitive to the adequacy of recent food intake, but does not reflect body protein status, [7] that voluntary grip strength is a practical and sensitive measure of the extent of body protein loss, [8] that body protein loss is an important, and hitherto unrecognized risk factor for postoperative pneumonia because of its impact on respiratory function [9] that the wound healing response is sensitive to the adequacy of recent food intake but not to body protein status, and [10] that a clinical assessment of weight loss, wasting and physiologic function can be objectively validated and can identify preoperative patients at an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. There are several important implications of these studies. The future direction of nutritional assessment will be the refinement of a clinical method that incorporates an assessment of physiologic function. Further study is required to demonstrate that nutritional therapy is able to reverse the impairment of clinically relevant physiologic functions and to demonstrate that such an improvement translates into a decrease in postoperative morbidity and mortality. It may be that specific defects due to Protein loss and responsible for the impairment of function can be identified and treated with shortterm nutritional therapy. The method of clinical assessment developed in this thesis can used be used to select preoperative patients for nutritional therapy and predict the likely efficacy of such therapy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CI-921 : a clinical, pharmacokinetic and metabolic study of a potential new cytotoxic agent</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Janet Rea</field><field name="description">CI-921, an analogue of the antileukaemic agent amsacrine, was produced in an attempt to develop a cytotoxic agent with a broader spectrum of activity. CI-921 was selected for clinical trial on the basis of superior in vivo and in vitro solid tumour activity. Sixteen patients with histologically documented cancer for which there was no conventional cytotoxic treatment were entered into a phase I trial. The dose of CI-921 was escalated from 39mg/m2 to 810mg/m2 (total dose divided over 3 days) and repeated 3 weekly. Neutropenia was the major dose limiting toxicity and defined a maximum tolerated dose of 810 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a biexponential pattern of drug distribution with a distribution half-life of 2.6 h. The kinetics appeared linear over the dose range tested. Less than 1% of total drug was excreted in the urine. Nineteen patients were entered into a limited phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer using CI-921 at a dose of 648 mg/m2 in the same 3-day schedule. One of the 16 evaluable patients achieved a partial response lasting five months. Myelosuppression was the predominant toxicity as in the phase I trial, but the degree of toxicity confirmed this dose as being suitable for further phase II trials. One patient had a grand mal seizure temporally associated with three of four courses of CI-927 raising the possibility of neurotoxicity. Although drug-induced cardiotoxicity has been reported with the parent drug amsacrine, there was no evidence of this in the current study. It has been suggested that CI-921 undergoes hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion following conjugation with glutathione. There was no fall in whole blood glutathione levels in patients following CI-921 infusion, although a transient decrease in mouse hepatic GSH was demonstrated following both amsacrine and CI-921. The toxicity of CI-921 in mice was markedly increased following depletion of hepatic glutathione with BSO but was not affected by pre-treatment with morphine or the glutathione "protector" N-acetyl cysteine.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of malnutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease</field><field name="creator">Christie, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">Patients suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) as a group uniformly suffer from nutritional problems. Nevertheless the extent, severity and clinical significance of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) in the various clinical presentations of these diseases remains unclear. In particular little is known of the nutritional status of the ambulatory patient with IBD. Confusion still exists over the long term nutritional changes following colectomy for colitis. Whether intravenous nutrition (IVN) should be prescribed in patients admitted to hospital for acute exacerbations of IBD still remains contentious. Recent work suggests that the significance of PEM relates to the associated impairments seen in various organ systems eg., impaired respiratory muscle function. Furthermore, there is other data to suggest that nutritional therapy may result in improvement in some of these physiological functions long before there is any measured change in the patient&#8217;s nutritional status. Through direct measurements of Body Composition (by neutron activation analysis in conjunction with tritium dilution) together with tests of physiological function (hepatosecretory proteins, skeletal muscle function, respiratory muscle function, wound healing and psychological function) work has been directed to clarify the following clinical questions:- 1. How extensive is the problem of protein depletion in the various clinical presentations of IBD? 2. What are the long term changes in body composition following surgery for colitis? and what is the nature of this restorative process. Is there a return to normal body composition? and if so, What is the duration of this recovery process? 3. What are the effects of a short course of IVN in patients suffering severe exacerbations of IBD? The results of these clinical studies have reaffirmed the high incidence of PEM in patients suffering from acute exacerbations of IBD, furthermore this work has established the existence of persisting protein deficits in the ambulatory patient with IBD who is in clinical remission. Contrary to previous reports, fully convalescent patients following surgery for colitis, were found to have normal body stores of protein and water. The timing of this restorative process was found however to take many months. A 2 week course of IVN was found not only to prevent further loss of body protein in a group of patients presenting with severe exacerbations of IBD, but also within a few days (4 days) lead to a significant improvement in hepatosecretory function, respiratory muscle function, skeletal muscle function, wound healing and psychological function. The magnitudes of these improvements although not complete was probably significant clinically. Following these early improvements, subsequent improvement was slow over many months and was dependent on an increase in body stores of protein.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular analysis of the endoflagella of the pathogenic treponemes</field><field name="creator">Isaacs, Robin David</field><field name="description">1. Motility of Treponema pallidum is mediated by endoflagella located within the periplasmic space. The endoflagella comprise a core surrounded by a sheath, with the sheath being composed of a 37-kD antigen (FlaA). 2. Treponemal endoflagella were isolated and component proteins were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed using the sheath protein and two core proteins from T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, and T. phagedenis. For all three proteins, the N-terminal sequences found for T. pallidum and T. pertenue were identical but differed from the sequence of T. phagedenis. The sheath proteins from the three treponemes were also compared by HPLC tryptic peptide maps: maps for T. pallidum and T. pertenue were very similar but differed from T. phagedenis. 3. A &#955;gt11 clone, &#955;A34, that expressed a portion of FlaA was selected from a T. pallidum genomic library using a murine monoclonal antibody. The insert from &#955;A34 provided a probe with which a chimeric plasmid, pRI4, encoding all but the nine N-terminal amino acids of FlaA was selected from a pBR322 T. pallidum genomic library. 4. The nucleotide sequence of flaA upstream of amino acid 10 could not be determined by routine cloning strategies. Instead, the remaining sequence was determined using the inverse- and asymmetric-polymerase chain reaction methods. flaA contains a consensus Escherichia coli promoter and a ribosome binding site. A single open reading frame encodes a precursor protein, pre-FlaA, of 350 amino acids with a calculated Mr 38,860. A 20 amino acid signal sequence with a typical signal peptidase I cleavage site immediately precedes the known N-terminus of FlaA. Twenty six per cent (91/350) of the DNA-derived amino acid sequence was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis of ten tryptic peptides derived from native FlaA. 5. Polymerase chain reaction-derived constructs lacking the native T. pallidum promoter were cloned downstream of a T7 promoter. T7 polymerase transcription was under the control of a PL &#955; promoter. When the &#955; repressor was inactivated at 42&#176;C, FlaA was expressed at relatively low levels in E. coli. Native and recombinant FlaA were identical as assessed by antibody reactivity and electrophoretic mobility in both sodium dodecyl sulphate- and two dimensional-polyacrylamide gels. 6. Although some pre-FlaA is processed to FlaA in E. coli, pre-FlaA is accumulated indicating inefficient processing of pre-FlaA in E. coli. Soluble FlaA was not detected in either the cytoplasmic or the periplasmic fractions of E. coli transformants. Fractionation of E. coli cell envelopes unexpectedly revealed that pre-FlaA and FlaA were associated with both the inner and outer membranes. 7. Two gene fusions, cro-lacZ-flaA and lacZ&#8217;-flaA, were constructed in an attempt to increase expression of the recombinant antigen; a bovine protease Xa site was engineered into the hybrid proteins immediately upstream of the N-terminus of FlaA to allow for subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the purified hybrid proteins. The LacZ&#8217;-FlaA protein was expressed in E. coli in increased amounts as compared with FlaA, but like recombinant FlaA, associated with both the inner and outer bacterial membranes. LacZ&#8217;-FlaA can be released from the membranes by treatment with 1% [wt/vol] sarkosyl, 6 M urea, or 6 M guanidine hydrochloride.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo isotopic studies of the metabolic effects of recombinant human growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors I and II</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Richard George</field><field name="description">The continued loss of protein from patients with severe sepsis, trauma or cancer cachexia, which occurs despite the provision of adequate calories and nitrogen, remains a challenge for surgeons and intensivists involved in their care. Prolonged loss of protein may impair cardiopulmonary and immune function and wound healing, and so its effective treatment may represent a considerable clinical advance. In this thesis, studies have been performed in both Patients and laboratory animals which investigate the potential of human growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors to slow or reverse the accelerated protein catabolism associated with severe surgical illness. In the patient studies, the following issues have been addressed: i) The effects of a short course of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the rate of net protein loss, whole body protein turnover, glucose kinetics, free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations and total carbohydrate and fat oxidation have been measured in septic and injured patients in both postabsorptive and parenterally fed states. ii) The effects of a short course of recombinant human growth hormone on the rate of protein synthesis has been determined in tissues removed from patients with cancer. In the animal studies the following issues have been addressed; i)The effects of acute infusions of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on the rate of net protein loss, whole body protein turnover, tissue protein synthesis, glucose kinetics and free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations have been measured. The actions of rhIGF-I infusion were then compared to those of an insulin infusion of equivalent hypoglycaemic potential and to an equimolar infusion of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor II (rhIGF-II). ii) The difficulty in achieving nitrogen accretion in patients with critical surgical illness or cancer cachexia may result from metabolic derangements caused by release of inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In order to determine whether recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) preserved its protein sparing effects in the face of high plasma TNF concentrations, rhIGF-I was infused into lambs which were simultaneously receiving infusions of recombinant human tumour necrosis factor (rhTNF), and the change in the rate of net protein loss compared to control animals who received rhIGF-I alone. The major findings of the human studies were as follows: i) In parenterally fed patients, rhGH treatment almost halved the rate of net protein loss, although a positive nitrogen balance was not achieved. The rate of whole body protein turnover was not altered, suggesting that the reduction in net protein loss was due to an increase in the rate of protein synthesis rather than reduced catabolism. In the post absorptive group, rhGH treatment increased the rate of appearance and oxidation of free fatty acids and reduced the rate of protein oxidation, from which it was concluded that fat was being oxidized in preference to protein. ii) The rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle tissue removed from patients with cancer undergoing resection to whom a short course of rhGH had been administered was significantly greater than that of a matched group of control patients, however the rate of protein synthesis in the tumour per se was not increased. It appears that rhGH favourably alters host tissue protein kinetics without accelerating the rate of tumour protein synthesis. The important results from the animal studies were as follows: i) Infusion of rhIGF-I reduced the rate of net protein loss by both increasing the rate of protein synthesis and reducing the rate of protein catabolism. The rate of protein synthesis was increased by a greater extent in the heart and in the diaphragm than in other skeletal muscles. High rates of rhIGF-I infusion which saturated the plasma IGF-I binding capacity lowered the blood glucose concentration by enhancing peripheral glucose uptake. Infusion of an equimolar dose of rhIGF-II did not influence protein kinetics but did result in a small increase in the rate of glucose clearance. Insulin infused at a dose which resulted in the same degree of hypoglycaemia as the rhIGF-I infusion caused a similar reduction in the rate of net protein loss but did not accelerate the rate of protein synthesis in any of the tissues examined. ii) Recombinant human TNF infusion resulted in pyrexia and increased the plasma glucose, cortisol, glucagon and insulin concentrations. The reduction in the rate of net protein loss following rhIGF-I infusion in rhTNF infused lambs was identical to that seen in control animals infused with rhIGF-I alone. We conclude that as rhIGF-I preserves its protein anabolic action in the face of high rhTNF levels, further investigation into a possible clinical role for rhIGF-I in severe surgical illness is warranted. In general terms, these studies demonstrate that rhGH administration to septic or injured patients significantly reduces their rate of loss of protein, and that rhIGF-I infusion similarly conserves protein in an animal model of sepsis. These findings present the challenge to determine whether the favourable changes in protein kinetics brought about by the administration of anabolic peptide hormones will realize tangible improvements in the clinical course of severely ill surgical patients.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacology of morphine and the active metabolite morphine 6-glucuronide : a comparison of pharmacological and clinical effects</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Paul Ivan</field><field name="description">Morphine is an effective potent analgesic. However the side effects of nausea, constipation and sedation are seen frequently. Respiratory depression is not such a common problem clinically but is the most potentially dangerous toxicity. An analgesic inducing equivalent analgesic potency without these toxicities would be particularly valuable. Morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G), one of the major metabolites of morphine, has analgesic activity in animals and animal studies have suggested an improved therapeutic index. The initial study in this thesis confirms the analgesic activity of M6G in man and the pharmacokinetic profile after intravenous and oral administration has been determined. The elimination half life is approximately 1.6 hours with the rate of clearance closely correlating with creatinine clearance. Oral bioavailability at approximately 5%, however, is poor due to its hydrophilic nature. In an effort to more critically examine the comparative emetic potency of M6G and morphine, both compounds were administered to the ferret, a known emetic model for man. Surprisingly M6G had a greater emetic potency in this model. A pilot pharmacokinetic study performed on the ferret revealed that M6G is only a very minor metabolite accounting for approximately only 1% of the metabolic product of morphine compared to 10% in man. It is possible that other aspects of opiate handling are also different, and reminds us of the importance in studying the drug handling of any animal model used for the testing of any drug, particularly when metabolites are thought to play a role in clinical effect. No patients or volunteers in the initial open studies in man experienced any nausea or sedation. This observation prompted a double-blind randomized study comparing the analgesic potency, respiratory depression, nausea and sedation induced by morphine and M6G in normal volunteers. This study confirmed that M6G has an increased analgesic potency in man when compared to morphine and causes significanctly less respiratory depression, nausea and sedation. It has been previously hypothesized that the &#181; opioid receptor with lower affinity for morphine, the &#181;2 receptor, is responsible for the majority of morphine toxic side-effects, including respiratory depression. The last study presented in this thesis utilises radioligand binding studies to determine the opioid receptor binding affinities of morphine and M6G at the &#181;1, &#181;2, total &#181; and delta opioid receptors. This reveals that M6G has a 5-fold lower binding affinity to the putative &#181;2 opioid receptor and hence provides a possible explanation for the decreased toxicity seen compared to morphine. In light of the findings in man above, further investigation of this active morphine metabolite is therefore indicated as M6G could prove particularly beneficial to those patients with severe underlying pulmonary disease and for obstetric use.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in Auckland children</field><field name="creator">Pattemore, Philip Keith</field><field name="description">Restricted Item. Print thesis available in the University of Auckland Library or available through Inter-Library Loan. In New Zealand (NZ) asthma mortality rates are higher than in any other developed country studied, and hospital admission rates for asthma are among the highest. Within NZ, both mortality and hospital admission rates for asthma are higher among Polynesians than among Europeans. To investigate the possibility that these differences were due to differences in asthma prevalence, a study was initiated to measure the prevalence and severity of asthma among both Europeans and Polynesians in Auckland using methods identical to those used in an overseas study. From all primary schools in the Auckland Urban Area, classes were sampled by two-stage, random, stratified sampling. In the winter of 1985, the children in the sampled classes were studied employing a questionnaire and a rapid, portable method of bronchial challenge testing with histamine which had been used to study schoolchildren aged 8 to 10 years in two areas in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Participation was 83%, the participants comprising 1084 European, 509 Maori, and 460 Pacific Island children, who were closely matched in gender and age to the NSW children. Prevalence of various items was compared including asthma symptoms, diagnosed asthma, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as a 20% fall in the one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), on or before the administration of a cumulative dose of 7.8 &#181;mol histamine. The prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms, BHR, severe BHR and BHR combined with symptoms were similar among the 1084 Auckland European children and 769 inland NSW children, but lower among 718 coastal NSW children than the other two sites. In Auckland, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms was higher in Maoris than among Europeans or Pacific Islanders, whereas prevalence of diagnosed asthma was similar in all three groups. Europeans had the highest rate of BHR and severe BHR followed by Maoris then Pacific Islanders. Maori and Pacific Island children reporting symptoms were less likely to receive prophylactic medication than European children. The study design also enabled assessment of the epidemiological correlates of BHR, which had been little studied in random populations before 1985. Among the Auckland children, bronchial responsiveness was found to be unimodally distributed, with no clear separation between children with a diagnosis or symptoms of asthma and those without. The presence or absence of BHR did not accurately identify children with a diagnosis or symptoms of asthma. A l4-variable multiple logistic regression model was developed which explained 27% of the variability in BHR rates. The main variables independently increasing BHR risk were: low baseline FEV1, a history of wheeze, diagnosed asthma, atopic conditions, or bronchodilator treatment, and European (as opposed to Polynesian) ethnicity. Climatic conditions at the time of the test were less strongly associated. In summary, neither the international nor the inter-ethnic differences in asthma mortality and asthma admission rates were adequately explained by differences in the prevalence of asthma symptoms, diagnosed asthma or BHR; however, differences in asthma severity and in the management of asthma may be contributory. In this large population-based study of children, BHR was associated independently with a number of different variables but did not precisely identify children reporting asthma symptoms or a diagnosis of asthma. Thus a single bronchial challenge test is not an ideal tool on its own for diagnosing asthma or measuring asthma prevalence.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of motor neuron disease in Scotland, 1989-90 : a prospective study of incidence, clinical features and prognosis, and incorporating a case control study of antecedent environmental factors</field><field name="creator">Chancellor, Andrew Martin</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 The part that 19th century Edinburgh medicine played in formulating the early concepts of motor neuron disease as a nosological entity is described, including some hitherto unrecognized descriptions by graduates of Edinburgh Medical School, including the first description of progressive bulbar palsy. Credit is given to the great European neurologists, especially charcot&#8217;s landmark contribution of the definitive clinico-pathological correlations. Terminology relating to MND is discussed and the problems which have arisen over the nosology relating to diseases of motor neurons. The requirement for a clearly defined classification system and the importance of measuring incidence in this disease are outlined. Chapter 2 A comprehensive review of previous studies of incidence, mortality and distribution is presented. It is suggested that the value of previous clinical descriptions and epidemiological studies of motor neuron disease (MND) have been limited by methodological problems. There appears to have been a real increase in mortality from MND over recent decades. Comparison of incidence in different places is complicated by non standardised methods of case-ascertainment and diagnosis but evidence is presented which challenges the traditional concept that the distribution of MND in developed countries is uniform and static. It remains uncertain, from the evidence available, if age specific incidence continues to rise into old age and the apparent &#8220;peak&#8221; in late-middle life is due to ascertainment bias. This is an important consideration on which to base aetiological hypotheses. In the northern hemisphere there is a weak positive correlation between standardised, age specific incidence and distance from the equator. There is a high prevalence focus of an atypical MND/ALS on Guam, and while an environmental factor is probably responsible, its nature is uncertain. The relevance of other reported clusters of MND is discussed and the requirements for the ideal study of MND incidence are outlined, which acted as the impetus for the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register (SMNDR). Chapter 3 The methodology of the SMNDR is described. This is the first collaborative, population based, prospective, epidemiological study of MND and illustrates the feasibility of such a study and the way in which Scotland is suited (in terms of size and National Health service structure) to such a project. Diagnostic criteria are outlined for application to this and other large scale studies. Of 257 patients registered with the SMNDR as possible MND diagnosed in 1989 and 1990 in Scotland, 229 with proven (by autopsy), clinically definite or probable, sporadic or familial MND, form the basis of the description of incidence, distribution, clinical features and natural history contained in this chapter. The crude incidence was 2.24/100,000/year and age specific incidence continued to rise steeply with age into the very elderly age bands. No evidence for clustering on the basis of Scottish regions was found. 5% of patients had a family history of MND; the clinical pattern varied according to sex and age, with elderly women most likely to present with, or develop, progressive bulbar palsy. Chapter 4 The utility of the 1989-90 Scottish Hospital In-patient statistics (SHIPS) and 1989-90 death certificate coding (Registrar General for Scotland) by International classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 335 (MND) are analysed as a tool for epidemiological studies and heath care planning. Coded hospital discharge data were an inaccurate record of a diagnosis of MND with a positive predictive value of a diagnosis of MND as determined by SHIPS of 70%. Such data cannot, in their present form, be used as a reliable measure of incidence in Scotland. Greater care is required in the preparation of summaries and coding if these data are to be useful care planning and epidemiological research. However, as an important source of case notification for the SMNDR to achieve a complete sample of patients. There was also a problematic false positive rate (10%) for mortality data but this source more closely approximated true incidence. Chapter 5 A review of previous case control studies of environmental risks for MND is presented. In order to test the hypothesis that certain environmental factors may play a role in the aetiology of MND, a case control study of 103 incident patients (diagnosis date May 1990-october 1991; 57 from the above cohort (as described in chapter 3) and 46 diagnosed in 1991, age and sex matched with community controls was conducted and is described. Measures were taken to minimise potential sources of bias and these are discussed. Fractures were more common in patients than controls especially in the in the five years prior to symptom onset (odds ratio = 15 (95% CI, 2.3-654). Manual workers were over represented and a number of environmental exposures of potential toxicity including exposure to lead (OR = 5.3, 95% CI, 1.5-11) and solvents or chemicals (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.5-11) were found. The limited extent of these associations favours a multifactorial aetiology for MND. No relationship to social class, poliovirus infection or to factors which might increase the risk of enteroviral infection in childhood (home space and domestic amenities) was found. Chapter 6 A comprehensive review of previous prognostic studies in MND is presented. An actuarial analysis of the survival of the cohort of 229 incident patients (57 seen in person) in Scotland in 1989-90, with complete follow up for a mean of two years from diagnosis, is calculated on the basis of the SMNDR clinical classification system. The overall 50% survival from diagnosis was 1.2 years (95% CI, 1.0-1.4) and from symptom onset, 2.5 years (95% CI, 2.2-3.0 years). There were significant differences in survival with a poorer prognosis for: progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), female sex and age &gt; 65 years. The presence of PBP and old age were the strongest predictors of outcome, the difference in survival between the sexes was due to the higher frequency of PBP in females. The overall five year survival from symptom onset was 27.7% (95% CI, 19.9-36.0%) but for patients with PBP as the presenting feature was only 3.5% (95% CI, 0.0-15%). These results suggest that, in well defined cohorts, survival can be predicted with some confidence and are useful for the planning of treatment trials.

The syndrome is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United Kingdom and it also contributes significantly to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal mortality is primarily due to cerebral complications. Despite continued research, the aetiology of preeclampsia remains unknown. This has limited the development of screening, preventive and therapeutic measures to control the syndrome. Present management is based on basic screening to detect early signs of the syndrome, observation of its progress and occasionally therapeutic intervention to control hypertension. Delivery is timed to prevent maternal and fetal complications, while simultaneously aiming to gain fetal maturity. Unfortunately, in many situations this control is not possible. Owing to an increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, a new option for prophylaxis - low-dose aspirin - may soon be available. If prevention of preeclampsia becomes a reality, a simple but sensitive screening test will be required to select those women who will benefit from treatment. This thesis is focused on the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications. It will involve examination of screening tests, the preventive therapy low-dose aspirin, and the preliminary assessment of a new technique to detect women at risk for developing cerebral complications from the disease.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EGF and PDGF receptors in endometrial cancer</field><field name="creator">Davis, Gregory Keith</field><field name="description">Despite its relatively good long term survival compared to other cancers in the female, endometrial carcinoma still kills 20% of those women who develop the disease worldwide. Abnormalities in growth factor receptors have been shown to be important in both the prognosis and probably the malignant transformation of the two other oestrogen-dependent cancers, breast and ovary, which suggests that similar defects may occur in endometrial cancer. In this thesis, two of these growth factor receptors, those for the epidermal and platelet-derived growth factors, are studied in endometrial cancer at the levels of the gene and expression of the proteins on the cell surface, in an attempt to detect abnormalities which might be implicated in carcinogenesis. No amplification or rearrangement of the EGFR gene was detected on 13 tumour samples initially, or of the EGF, PDGF &#945;- and &#946;-subunit receptor genes subsequently on a mixture of tumour samples and cell from endometrial cancer cell lines. The size of the EGF and PDGF receptor proteins and the activation of their tyrosine kinase domains was assessed in an oestrogen responsive (Ishikawa) and an oestrogen independent (HEC-1-A) endometrial cancer cell line. Functioning receptors for EGF were demonstrated in both cell lines but no PDGF receptors were detected. EGF-binding studies were carried out and appropriate affinity constants and receptor numbers obtained in both cell lines. The growth of Ishikawa and HEC-1-A cells in culture was studied but because of the rapid growth of both lines in the absence of serum no meaningful mitogenic effects were shown by any growth factor or steroid. Phorbol ester and TGF-&#946; inhibited the growth of HEC-1-A and Ishikawa cells, respectively. Of particular interest was that, despite the reported sensitivity of Ishikawa cells to oestrogen, no consistent stimulation was observed. The growth of both cell lines in the absence of serum suggested that the cells might be secreting growth factors and conditioned medium was obtained from long term, large scale cultures. The medium was concentrated and passed through a size exclusion column and the fractions assayed for DNA synthesis and competition for EGF-binding to Swiss 3T3 cells. No consistent effect on either of these assays was shown and no further investigation was undertaken.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic effects of proinflammatory cytokines</field><field name="creator">Hill, Andrew Graham</field><field name="description">The metabolic responses to trauma are well characterized and there is growing evidence supporting an important role for cytokines in its pathogenesis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are synthesized in the brain, and other tissues, in trauma. In order to test the hypothesis that these cytokines play an important role in the metabolic responses associated with trauma, the effects of chronic cerebroventricular and peripheral infusions of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF on protein metabolism, weight loss, anorexia, and pyrexia in Sprague-Dawley rats were examined. Specifically the aims of these investigations were: 1. To examine the effect of chronic central nervous system exposure to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. 2. To investigate the role of anorexia in the catabolic responses to centrally infused IL-1. 3. To investigate the effects of IL-1 on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 4. To investigate the role of glucocorticoids in the metabolic effects produced by chronic central infusion of IL-1. 5. To examine the metabolic effects of increasing doses of chronic peripherally infused IL-1 and to distinguish between those responses mediated centrally and those mediated outside the blood-brain-barrier. The major findings of these studies were: 1. IL-1, but not IL-6 in the same dose, nor TNF in a lower dose, produced net protein catabolism, weight loss, and pyrexia in excess of that produced by anorexia alone. 2. Furthermore the loss of weight and nitrogen did not require sustained elevations of glucocorticoids, as IL-1 infusion in corticosterone-replaced, adrenalectomized rats resulted in similar losses of weight and nitrogen as observed in sham-adrenalectomized animals infused with IL-1. 3. Peripheral infusion of increasing doses of IL-1 mimicked the effects of increasing injury with low doses causing a mild acute phase response (as assessed by a fall in serum iron and albumin and a leucocytosis) and larger doses causing net protein catabolism and weight loss. An attempt was made to distinguish between the central and peripherally mediated metabolic effects of IL-1 using a novel model utilizing peripheral infusions of IL-1 and central infusions of IL-1 receptor antagonist. Using this model the data were consistent with the hypotheses that pyrexia is mediated inside and outside the blood-brain barrier and that leucocytosis is mediated by a direct peripheral effect, probably on the bone-marrow. In conclusion, centrally produced IL-1 may play an important role in the metabolic responses associated with trauma and this is in excess of the anorexia and adrenocortical activation produced by centrally acting IL-1. Peripherally produced IL-1 may play a role in various organs such as the bone-marrow and the liver to produce other features of the metabolic responses associated with injury.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of low molecular weight proteins in the diagnosis of renal tubular dysfunction in children</field><field name="creator">Tomlinson, Paul Andrew</field><field name="description">Low molecular weight (LMW) proteins pass easily through the glomerular filter and are almost completely reabsorbed by the proximal renal tubule in health. An increase in their urinary excretion implies failure of reabsorption and may signal tubular dysfunction. &#946;2-microglobulin (B2M) is a sensitive marker of tubular dysfunction, but is unstable in acid urine, whilst only limited data are available for other LMW proteins. The aim of these studies was to determine the prevalence of elevated LMW protein excretion in children with renal disease and to identify factors influencing LMW protein excretion. Secondly, these studies sought to determine conditions where individual proteins might best indicate tubular dysfunction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure B2M, &#945;1-microglobulin (A1M) and urine protein 1 (UP1) in plasma and urine, and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in urine. Albumin, the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), creatinine and pH were also measured in urine. Each protein excretion was expressed as a ratio to creatinine concentration. B2M showed instability in urine with pH below 6.0, RBP was unstable in urine below pH 5.0 following frozen storage whilst A1M and UP1 were stable at physiological pH. Two groups of apparently healthy children were studied, and normal ranges were established for protein excretion in random and overnight samples. A comparison of B2M, A1M, UP1, RBP and NAG excretion was undertaken in tubular disease and in glomerular disease. A1M, UP1 and NAG were correlated with increasing albumin excretion in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, in contrast to B2M and RBP. Compared with A1M, UP1 and NAG, RBP was more closely associated with tubulo-interstitial involvement histologically. There was abnormal RBP excretion in reflux nephropathy, with levels increasing according to the degree of scarring. Increased RBP excretion was also seen in cystic disease, neurogenic bladder, allograft rejection and chronic glomerular disease. RBP excretion was inversely correlated with glomerular filtration rate in reflux nephropathy and in glomerular disease. RBP excretion was increased in diabetic children and was correlated with albumin excretion and with metabolic control. LMW protein excretion is common in children with renal problems, and may be a marker of disease severity. RBP is the most suitable marker of tubular dysfunction.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the immunopathology of inflammatory arthritis</field><field name="creator">McQueen, Fiona Marion Florence</field><field name="description">This volume contains an introduction to the topic of inflammatory arthritis, followed by Chapter 2 which is a Materials and Methods section and includes experimental protocols used for the original research detailed in Chapters 3 to 6 (Sections 2.1 - 2.4).

Recently the topic of poor fetal growth has generated considerable research interest, as numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that small size at birth is also associated with increased risks of adult cardiovascular diseases and non-insulin dependent diabetes Antenatal treatment aimed at improving fetal growth might therefore reduce perinatal morbidity, as well as later complications of being born small for gestational age (SGA). SGA fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies have placental vascular pathology. Low dose aspirin, which inhibits the production of the powerful vasoconstrictor thromboxane, might therefore increase placental blood flow and fetal growth. The hypothesis in the first antenatal study was that treatment of SGA pregnancies, with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies, with aspirin (100 mg) for &#8805;14 days, would increase fetal weight. As perinatal morbidity and mortality are increased in SGA pregnancies most obstetricians advocate a programme of regular fetal surveillance. Outpatient management with twice weekly fetal surveillance has been usual practice in our hospital in uncomplicated SGA pregnancies. These frequent checks may be unnecessary when umbilical artery Doppler studies are normal as the risk of serious perinatal morbidity is low. More conservative management in SGA pregnancies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies has been suggested by several authors but has only been evaluated in one previous trial, where hospitalisation was usual practice. In the second antenatal study we therefore wished to test the hypothesis that the frequency of fetal surveillance could be reduced from twice weekly to fortnightly, in SGA pregnancies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies, without increasing maternal or perinatal morbidity. Abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies have been shown in a number of reports to be associated with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity, in SGA pregnancies. Previous investigators have not considered the potential confounding effects of both gestational age at delivery and birthweight in relation to umbilical artery Doppler status. SGA babies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies, have a low risk of complications and have been called &#8216;small normal babies&#8217; although there is little data to support this claim. In the third antenatal study the following hypotheses were tested: that abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies would predict newborn morbidity in SGA babies, independent of birthweight and gestational age; that compared with SGA babies with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies, SGA babies with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies would have low rates of newborn morbidity and malnutrition; and that their mothers would be smaller, have different ethnic distribution, and have lower rates of vascular problems in pregnancy than mothers of SGA babies with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies. After birth approximately 20% of SGA babies fail to show catchup growth and remain short at two years of age. Persisting short stature has been associated with later psychological difficulties, abnormal neurodevelopmental testing in childhood, poor school performance and hypertension in childhood and adult life. Most catchup growth occurs in the first six months after birth and most children who are small at six months will not show further catchup growth. Early identification of children who will remain small may enable interventions aimed at improving later outcomes. There are no previous reports of the influence of perinatal variables on size at six months. In the first postnatal study in this thesis we therefore chose to investigate the perinatal factors associated with small size at six months of age. We tested the hypotheses that children who were small at six months would: have been diagnosed SGA earlier in pregnancy; be more likely to have abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies; have smaller body proportions at birth; and be more likely to have normal ponderal indices at birth. Previous studies, mostly of children born in the 1960s and 1970s, have reported more abnormal neurodevelopmental test results in children who were SGA at birth compared with appropriate weight for gestational age children. There are very few published studies of neurodevelopmental outcome in SGA children born in the 1990s, who have had the advantage of recent advances in antenatal and especially newborn care. The aims of the second postnatal study were therefore to: assess neurodevelopmental outcome in a cohort of SGA children at 18 months and compare results to a reference population; determine whether one or more of the following perinatal variables might be predictive of abnormal neurodevelopmental test results: early recognition of SGA antenatally, abnormal antenatal Doppler results, lack of participation in the antenatal studies in SGA pregnancies, gestation at delivery, head size at birth, head growth from birth to six months, and ponderal index at birth.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic effects of general anaesthetics : a suite of clinical studies and theoretical models</field><field name="creator">Sleigh, James Wallace</field><field name="description">The primary object of this thesis was to investigate aspects of empirically-measured, anaesthesia-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that could be explained by network models of cortical interactions. The thesis consists of a collection of various theoretical and clinical papers in three sections: (a) A background section summarizing previous relevant published works on the molecular actions of anaesthetic agents, and the origin and problems with the acquisition of the EEG. (b) A second section dealing with the development of various theoretical / computer models of general anaesthetic action. (c) A third section of various clinical and EEG studies of anaesthesia and sleep. These were done to confirm and clarify some of the theoretical results from the models. However there are many different ways of numerically capturing the information contained within the EEG. Because this problem needed to be overcome before the primary aim of the thesis could be accurately handled; the clinical studies tended to be diverted into this secondary "signal-acquisition" aspect of the EEG analysis in anaesthesia and sleep. Because the thesis has a constellation of different interlocking threads of investigation, I have summarized the various themes in the following table. (A) Background Section The relevant conclusions from the background section were: 1) The transition from aesthesia to anaesthesia involved the whole animal, and thus may not be entirely measurable by the EEG. In contrast the transitions from consciousness to coma - and even more specifically - from mnesis to amnesis were predominantly observable by changes in the activity of the cortex and in the resultant EEG signal. 2) The EEG signal arose largely from the summation of coherent post-synaptic potentials in the cortical pyramidal cells. These were, in turn, mainly controlled by cortical layer-l modulation - which was subject to ascending neuromodulatory systems. 3) The main artifacts in the EEG signal were eye-movements, blinks, and frontalis EMG. 4) The Bispectral index (BIS) consisted of three subcomponents. The first two (BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow) probably reflected the loss of high-frequency activity that is associated with the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. 5) The state of the midbrain reticular formation projecting via the non-specific thalamocortical connections can profoundly alter the oscillatory state of the cortex and thence the EEG. Direct or indirect actions of general anaesthetic agents on these structures may be a major cause of the observed EEG changes. These changes are qualitatively similar to the changes observed during natural sleep. 6) Although there was variation between different agents, the most consistent action of commonly-used general anaesthetic agents was to prolong the fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential&gt; 50% by GABAergic potentiation. This action was consonant with the observed EEG effects of anaesthesia - which are (1) an increase in EEG spectral power and frequency followed by, (2) a decrease in dominant frequency and overall power with increasing concentrations: the so-called "biphasic response" There were also a number of more specific features: namely loss of alpha band activity, an initial increase in relative beta activity, followed by a shift to lower frequencies, spindles - and in deep anaesthesia - burst suppression patterns. Other contributions to anaesthetic action may include: (1) inhibition of NMDA receptor function, (2) reduction of nicotinic acetylcholine modulation, and (3) a direct hyperpolarizing action by opening potassium channels. Anaesthetic agents disrupted cortical function at lower doses than those required for inhibition of brain stem function. (B) Theoretical Models The fact that the cerebral cortex consisted of, effectively, a two-dimensional interconnecting neural network was of overriding importance. All the theoretical models were constrained by this topological fact, and showed a remarkable degree of similarity. Regardless of whether the model was continuous (appendix 2) or discrete (cellular automata), some robust and consistent features emerged: 1) Some form of abrupt decrease in information flow within the network occurred when the interaction between the network elements was interrupted greater than certain critical threshold amount - the order/disorder phase transition. 2) This critical point was manifest as (i) a large change in the simulated mean soma potential (the order parameter), (ii) divergence of the spectral power of the simulated pseudoEEG signal, and (iii) decrease in frequency content (in the cellular automaton models). Unfortunately the order parameter for the EEG is probably unmeasurable in clinical practice. The first derivative is measurable, but not completely reliable as a proxy order parameter. 3) All models required some form of noisy external (subcortical) input to drive them. Variations in this input could explain some of the anomalies observed in the clinical section of the thesis. (C) Clinical Papers The clinical papers were a series of papers recording the clinical data, which then influenced the development of the theoretical models. The single most popular clinical measure of anaesthetic depth in present practice is the Bispectral Index (BIS). Many of these studies explore the strengths and weaknesses of this index in various clinical situations. The main disadvantage of the BIS was that crucial aspects of its formulation are not in the public domain for commercial reasons. We attempted to separate out the changes in the various subcomponents of the BIS in patients under general anaesthesia, and natural sleep. 1) In the first paper we described how the EEG changed during induction and recovery from general anaesthesia with propofol and isoflurane. We compared EEG vs heart rate variability changes as monitors of anaesthetic depth. This study served to evaluate a clinically accepted measure of anaesthetic depth, as well as gaining practical EEG experience in collecting experimental data, both using the ASPECT EEG monitor, and in devising the best clinical methods of quantifying levels of consciousness. The main results were that the BIS was relatively reliable in steady-state conditions, and better than the raw 95% spectral edge frequency, and the approximate entropy of the EEG. 2) Auditory recall and response-to-command during recovery from propofol anaesthesia. In this paper we were able to collect data in a very controlled situation, somewhat different from that pertaining to clinical practice. From this we were able to identify separate components of consciousness and mnesis and how they correlated with EEG changes. We were also able to compare frontal and parietal EEG data. We established that there is a clear divergence of spectral power around the time of loss-of-consciousness when the propofol was administered as a slow infusion. This is good evidence supporting the basis of the theoretical models. This experiment also established that it is possible for a patient to be conscious, not paralyzed, but not responding to verbal command. 3) Electroencephalographic measures of depth of anaesthesia: the importance of the gamma band and the electromyogram signal. This study was concerned with different technical aspects of EEG signal acquisition and processing. It suggested that usually the EMG is not a significant problem, and that the gamma (40-60Hz) frequency band is important in distinguishing the awake from the anaesthetized state. 4) The Bispectral Index: A Measure of Depth of Sleep? Because the EEG changes of general anaesthesia are very similar to those of sleep, this study was a simple observational study collecting some information about changes in the BIS with natural sleep. 5) The Bispectral Index and Sleep Stage: A Polysomnographic study. In this study we formally compared the BIS with a full polysomnogramnographic sleep staging. It confirmed the results of the previous study, and demonstrated that the subcomponents of the BIS (the BetaRatio and the SynchFastSlow) changed in a manner very similar to those observed under general anaesthetic. Conclusions The observed changes in the EEG on induction of anaesthesia can be explained by changes in relatively simple theoretical network models. These changes can be reliably reduced to univariate Parameters</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and angiographic outcome following percutaneous coronary intervention</field><field name="creator">Ruygrok, Peter Nicolas</field><field name="description">This volume contains a series of linking chapters that follow the evolution of percutaneous intervention from conventional balloon angioplasty in the early to mid 1990s to stent implantation which has now become standard practice. It describes contributions to the extension of clinical situations in which percutaneous intervention has been found to be efficacious as well as refinements in practice and technique. I was fortunate to have been a fellow and then staff member of the Cardiology department of the Thoraxcenter, Rotterdam from 1993-1995, which was then, and remains, at the forefront of the development of percutaneous coronary interventional techniques. My continued links with the Thoraxcenter as well as new projects have allowed me to continue my research and complete this thesis. Part 1 contains two chapters on balloon angioplasty which was standard clinical practice for suitable obstructive coronary lesions until the mid 1990s. The first chapter describes an audit of immediate clinical outcome and thus rates of procedure related complications of contemporary practice in a high volume unit following 970 balloon angioplasty procedures over a one-year period. Although the rate of adverse events appeared to remain static when compared to the previous decade, the requirement for emergency bypass surgery appeared to be diminishing and it is suggested that may be due to the increasing availability of stents for "bail-out". The second chapter studies the long-term outcome with respect to major adverse clinical events in 856 consecutive patients treated by balloon angioplasty from 1980-1985. Although the long-term outcome was good and comparable to results of coronary bypass surgery, most patients suffered a further cardiac event during the 10 years following balloon angioplasty, most of which were repeat revascularisation. Part 2 contains four chapters that describe and document contributions to the evolution of percutaneous coronary interventional practice from balloon angioplasty to stent implantation. Chapter 1 is a review of the literature that describes the evolution of stenting from early animal experiments through early human studies to current practice and on to a vision of the future. Chapter 2 describes follow-up of patients enrolled in the Benestent I study, which was pivotal to the introduction of stenting into clinical practice. Patients, in many centres world-wide, were randomised to balloon angioplasty or stent implantation and underwent 6-month clinical and angiographic follow-up. We report the extended one-year clinical outcome. Chapter 3 documents the landmark Benestent II study. This was a randomised comparison of 827 patients in many centres worldwide (including Auckland) who were allocated to balloon angioplasty or a heparin-coated stent plus treatment with the anti-platelet agent ticlopidine. Patients randomised to stent implantation suffered fewer adverse events and less restenosis but this treatment was found to be more costly than balloon angioplasty. Chapter 4 analyses in more detail some data from the Benestent II study. As well as being randomised to balloon angioplasty or stent implantation, patients were also sub-randomised to 6 month clinical only or clinical and angiographic follow-up. We therefore set out to assess whether management and outcome were influenced as a result of a follow-up angiogram. We found that more interventions were undertaken in those who underwent angiography with no adverse effect on outcome. As a result of the above and other studies, stenting has become routine clinical practice with most patients (approximately 90%) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention receiving a stent. Part 3 describes several studies which have expanded our knowledge of stenting in various clinical situations and conditions, and also incorporates studies that have added refinement to the technique of stenting. Chapter 1 studies the intermediate term clinical outcome of stent implantation in degenerated saphenous vein grafts. Although the immediate outcome is good, with respect to adverse clinical events, the long-term benefit is limited indicating that with the available technology and medication percutaneous treatment of vein graft is a palliative procedure. Chapter 2 describes the results of a prospective multicentre study assessing the outcome of stenting long native coronary artery lesions. The rates of restenosis were acceptable. The study also provides us with an opportunity to analyse, using quantitative coronary angiography, the location of and give insights into, the mechanism of the restenosis process. Chapter 3 studies the outcome of stenting smaller coronary arteries. Its unique design, in that patients were required to have a lesion in a "small" and a "large" vessel, has provided us with the opportunity to compare both the rates and nature of the restenosis process in the same patients. In this way we abolished clinical and procedure related variables that confound the results when using historical comparisons. Chapter 4 describes the introduction of a new stent, the MultiLink stent, into everyday clinical usage. As with all new devices and minor variations of contemporary devices, which slowly undergo small progressive changes, a careful assessment and audit must be undertaken to ensure it has resulted in improvement in, or at least no detriment to patient care. This chapter audits the clinical outcome of a new stent implanted in the first 126 patients in Auckland and Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne. Chapter 5 is a study that tests a refinement in interventional technique. With refinement and miniaturisation of angioplasty equipment including the profile of balloons and stents, the possibly of implanting a stent without predilating the lesions with a balloon was raised. In this study 81 patients with suitable coronary artery lesions were randomised to stenting with and without predilatation. It was found that in selected patients a strategy of direct stenting was feasible, faster and more rapid than stenting after predilatation. Chapter 6 describes a study which analyses data from 10 studies co-ordinated and managed by the Cardialysis core laboratory in Rotterdam The inclusion of risk factors allows the opportunity to perform meta-analyses looking for factors that may influence outcomes. In this case we attempted to identify clinical and angiographic factors that influence asymptomatic restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. Chapter 7 gives an overview of angioplasty numbers and practice in New Zealand by summarising data from the National Angioplasty Registry for the years 1995-1998. This period saw a steady growth in patients with coronary artery disease treated by percutaneous intervention and the number of patients who received stents rose from 23% in 1995 to 84% in 1998. This data attests to the data and results of the earlier studies reported in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a T-cell assay for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the Gambia</field><field name="creator">Hill, Philip Campbell</field><field name="description">New generation T cell assays offer hope in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease. We assessed the ELISPOT assay using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and a natural gradient of M. tuberculosis exposure by sleeping proximity to a tuberculosis (TB) case in The Gambia. Two antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (EC), were compared to purified protein derivative (PPD) by ELISPOT and to the PPD skin test in 735 TB contacts. All three tests responded to the exposure gradient, the PPD skin test most dramatically. Inter-test comparison showed that the EC ELISPOT provided improved specificity in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection, but at the cost of some sensitivity. Increasing discordance, particularly between PPD ELISPOT and PPD skin test results, down the exposure gradient to 105 community controls was identified. In 693 children, the EC ELISPOT was slightly less sensitive than the PPD skin test in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection from recent exposure; neither test was confounded by prior BCG vaccination, even in the very young. A fusion protein of EC compared favourably with their respective peptides by ELISPOT assay in 488 TB contacts, a combined test result offered improved sensitivity. Quantitative ELISPOT and PPD-skin test responses were assessed in 1052 TB case contacts, according to an ELISPOT response to EC. Only the ELISPOT count was sensitive to the exposure gradient (p=0.009), revealing a positive dose-response relationship. In the longitudinal assessment, both ELISPOT and PPD skin test conversion occurred over time. PPD skin test reversion occurred in 10% of individuals after 18 months, ELISPOT reversion occurred in 39% at 3 months. In conclusion: the EC ELISPOT offers increased specificity in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in The Gambia, at the cost of some sensitivity; the PPD skin test appears to be down-regulated in the community; neither test is confounded by prior BCG vaccination; a fusion protein in combination with EC peptides offers optimal ELISPOT sensitivity; the quantitative ELISPOT response in specific-antigen-positive TB case contacts reflects the infectious load of M. tuberculosis; and significant early reversion of the ELISPOT test suggests it is unreliable in M. tuberculosis dormancy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipiodol fertility enhancement in unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Neil Philip</field><field name="description">Objectives This thesis had the following objectives: 1) To assess the existing evidence base for the effectiveness of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section II, Chapters 4 and 5). 2) To assess current practice and prior beliefs amongst Australasian fertility specialists concerning the role of tubal flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section III, Chapter 6). 3) To investigate the possible mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect of the oil soluble contrast medium lipiodol, and specifically whether there is an effect on the endometrium (Section IV, Chapter 7). 4) To generate definitive evidence from a randomised controlled trial for the effectiveness of lipiodol flushing as a treatment for infertility (Section V, Chapters 8 and 9). 5) To evaluate the adoption of lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment into clinical practice (Section VI, Chapter 10). Methods The work undertaken in this thesis was based on prospective study protocols using the following research methodologies: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of treatment efficacy to meet objective 1. Two types of structured survey questionnaires with a Bayesian analysis to meet objective 2. A randomised animal study involving 60 Swiss white mice, combined with genital flushing procedures under anaesthesia, some of which involved microsurgical techniques, followed by genital tissue harvesting, tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry studies to meet objective 3. An open, parallel group, single centre, randomised controlled trial involving 158 women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility to meet objective 4. A survival analysis of women in the lipiodol flushing randomised trial to meet objectives 4 and 5. A prospective observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol flushing in clinical practice to meet objective 5. A clinical hysterosalpingogram procedure to meet objective 4 and 5. Results 1) Eight randomised controlled trials involving 1,971 women were identified and included in the systematic review. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media versus no intervention was associated with a significant increase in the odds of pregnancy (Peto odds ratio [OR] 3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76 to 7.23) but there were no data for live birth. There were no data from RCTs to assess tubal flushing with water-soluble media versus no intervention. Tubal flushing with oil soluble contrast media was associated with a significant increase in the odds of live birth versus tubal flushing with water soluble contrast media (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.11) but the odds of pregnancy showed no significant difference (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.57) and there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes. The addition of oil soluble contrast media to flushing with water soluble contrast media (water plus oil soluble contrast media versus water soluble contrast media alone) showed no significant difference in the odds of live birth (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.77) or pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70). 2) Nineteen Australasian fertility specialists returned survey questionnaires. Eighteen of the 19 specialists believed that lipiodol flushing was more likely to be beneficial than harmful. The most widely held prior belief, reflected in both textual and numerical responses, was that lipiodol was likely to produce a small beneficial response. The credible limits of this belief were compatible with a reasonable fertility benefit, as more than 50% believed that a 1.5-fold increase in pregnancy rate was plausible. The two surveys found that a 1.2-fold or 1.4-fold increase in pregnancy rate was the median expected level of benefit at which clinicians would have been inclined to recommend lipiodol flushing to their patients (combined range 1.1 to 2.3-fold). Individual and collective equipoise was justification to proceed with a definitive randomised controlled trial. 3) The mean number of cluster determinant (CD) 205+ uterine dendritic cells decreased significantly in mice following lipiodol treatment compared to sham treated and saline treated mice, particularly in endometrial and subendometrial tissues. The mean number of CD1+ uterine dendritic cells increased significantly following lipiodol treatment compared to shamtreatment. No significant differences were found in the mean number of total leukocytes or macrophages in the murine uterus between the three treatment groups. 4) Six month follow up of the randomised trial of 158 women showed that lipiodol flushing resulted in a significant increase in pregnancy (48.0% versus 10.8%, RR 4.44, 95% CI 1.61-12.21) and live birth (40.0% versus 10.8%, RR 3.70,.95% CI 1.30-10.50) rates versus no intervention for women with endometriosis (n=62), although there was no significant difference in pregnancy (33.3% versus 20.8%, RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.81-3.16) or live birth (27.1% versus 14.6%, RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.81-4.25) rates for women with unexplained infertility without confirmed endometriosis (n=96). Survival analysis up to 24 months showed a significant benefit in overall pregnancy rate following lipiodol treatment (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.2) for the combined endometriosis and unexplained infertility populations. Amongst women with endometriosis, the benefit in pregnancy rate seen in the first 6 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 5.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 14.2) was not present at 6 to 24 months following lipiodol (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.1). There was a more consistent effect of lipiodol on fertility throughout the 24 month follow up amongst women with unexplained infertility (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.5). 5) Six month follow up in the observational study of 100 women undergoing lipiodol flushing as an innovative treatment in clinical practice showed an overall pregnancy rate 30% and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate 27% six months after the procedure. For women under 40 years old, a 32% pregnancy rate and 25% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with unexplained infertility; a 50% pregnancy rate and 47% live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was seen in women with endometriosis. Of women aged 40 years and older, the pregnancy rate was 13% and the live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate was 13%. The pregnancy rates included those occurring after additional interventions, such as intrauterine insemination and in-vitro fertilisation, accounting for 12 of the 30 pregnancies. There were no treatment complications. Conclusions The conclusions of this thesis are as follows. Lipiodol flushing is a simple, inexpensive, effective fertility treatment, which carries a very low chance of complications and no increased chance of multiple pregnancy. Lipiodol treatment is particularly effective in the short term for women with endometriosis who have normal patent fallopian tubes. The fertility benefit from lipiodol treatment lasts longer for women with pure unexplained infertility than for women with endometriosis. The level of benefit from lipiodol treatment for women with unexplained and endometriosis-related infertility is of sufficient magnitude to convince most fertility specialists surveyed that it is a worthwhile treatment to offer routinely in clinical practice; however complex factors govern the implementation of an innovative fertility treatment. Observational study of the first 100 women to undergo lipiodol treatment in clinical practice has provided further evidence of the efficacy and safety of this approach. Uterine dendritic cell changes following lipiodol flushing in mice suggest that the mechanism of the fertility enhancing effect might be an immunobiologic effect on the endometrium that could improve the receptivity of the endometrium (rather than a mechanical tubal flushing effect), although this hypothesis requires further exploration in women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective cerebral hypothermia for term infants following hypoxic ischaemic injury</field><field name="creator">Battin, Malcolm Richard</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxic ischaemic injury is an important cause of both neonatal death and long-term disability. The sequence of resuscitation followed by a latent phase then a secondary cascade of injury is well documented. This thesis covers key steps toward the utilization of selective hypothermia as an intervention during the latent phase to ameliorate the secondary injury and improve subsequent outcome. The technique was shown to be both feasible and well tolerated. Specifically, a rectal temperature of 35 &#176;C and 34.5 &#176;C, in term infants with neonatal encephalopathy, was not associated with an excessive requirement for cardio-respiratory support. Although a decrease in heart rate occurred during cooling, this was expected and there was no significant change in blood pressure during either the cooling or rewarming phase. Additional reassuring findings were that neither major electrolyte disturbance; hypoglycaemia or haematological changes, including excessive haemorrhage, were observed during hypothermia. The study of neurodevelopmental outcome established that selective cerebral hypothermia was not associated with late adverse effects and, in infants with moderate to severe encephalopathy, the combined cooled groups demonstrated a trend towards better outcome. These data confirmed the potential for selective cerebral hypothermia to provide neuroprotection following perinatal asphyxia. In further chapters cerebral CT scan was confirmed as a helpful adjunct to clinical staging in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome and important clinical experience was reported including rebound seizures following rewarming; sclerema neonatorum associated with hypothermia; and abnormal flow in the superior sagittal sinus, associated with perinatal asphyxia. Lastly a review of infants assessed but not recruited to the CoolCap trial based on aEEG criteria was performed. As these aEEG criteria could be applied to future clinical use it was considered important to ensure large numbers of infants with potential to benefit were not excluded from intervention Neurodevelopmental status for those infants excluded by the aEEG criteria was largely favourable but a small number had adverse outcome and the majority manifested short term morbidity. In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis suggests that intervention with selective hypothermia offers the potential to change disease progression and improve subsequent outcome following perinatal asphyxia at term.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uterine effects of inhibition of progesterone synthesis by a specific 3 B hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor</field><field name="creator">Pattison, Neil Spencer</field><field name="description">The steroid hormone progesterone is considered indisPensible for pregnancy - it is the 'hormone of pregnancy' as described by corner (1928).

There is however, a conflict of opinion concerning its role in pregnancy termination. In some species, for example the sheep, there is considerable evidence that progesterone provides an important link between fetal cortisol and the control of uterine activity. But in human pregnancy the evidence is conflicting.

The source and management of donor tissue procured by the New Zealand National Eye Bank (NZNEB) was analysed. Significant trends were identified with respect to donor demographics, donor procurement source, improved donor tissue processing and storage, decreased biological contamination, and increased utilization of corneal tissue. Current trends and ethnicity differences in indications for penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) were investigated. Keratoconus was identified as the most common indication for PKP in New Zealand, accounting for a significantly higher proportion of PKPs than other published reports. Keratoconus was the most common indication for PKP throughout all ethnicity groups and was particularly common in the Maori and Polynesian populations. Significant trends were identified including an increase in the number of PKPs for regraft and Fuchs&#8217; endothelial dystrophy and a decrease for aphakic or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and viral keratitis. Survival and visual outcome following PKP in New Zealand was investigated using univariate and multivariate analysis. Several independent risk factors were identified that influenced outcome of PKP. Active inflammation at PKP, pre-existing vascularisation, pre-operative glaucoma, small or large graft size, intra-operative complications, episodes of reversible rejection and a pre-operative diagnosis of regraft, trauma or infection resulted in a significantly decreased survival rate. Advancing recipient age, active inflammation at the time of PKP, pre-existing vascularisation, pre-operative glaucoma, episodes of reversible rejection, bullous keratopathy, trauma and non-infective keratitis were associated with poor visual outcome. Patient characteristics, indications, surgical details, and outcome of paediatric keratoplasty were analysed. Acquired non-traumatic indications accounted for the majority of paediatric keratoplasties in New Zealand. This study highlighted keratoconus as a particularly common indication for paediatric keratoplasty when compared to other countries. Survival and visual outcome was better for acquired compared to congenital indications. The effects of corneal parameters on the measurement of endothelial cell density (ECD) in the normal eye were analysed. Corneal thickness appears to be negatively correlated to ECD in the normal cornea for all age groups. Corneal diameter is correlated to ECD measurement in children but not in adults. Corneal curvature was not significantly correlated to ECD measurement, but this needs further investigation. Confocal microscopy and slit scanning topography were used to analyze endothelial morphology and function in the short and long term following PKP. The results of this study are in concordance with other published reports that have identified an accelerated loss of endothelial cells and more rapid development of abnormal endothelial cells in transplanted corneas compared to normal corneas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment : a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Polkinghorne, Philip John</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is recognised as a serious and potentially blinding disorder but little is known about the prevalence, risk factors, management and outcomes for treatment for our population. This thesis attempts to investigate these issues and part of that documentation involved a clinical review of those individuals presenting with RRD. That survey was performed over a 16 month interval enabling the annualised rate for individuals presenting with a new RRD to be determined. The prevalence was found to be 11.8 per 100,000. The risk was age-related with the incidence of RRD increasing for each decade up until the age of 70 years. Men had a slightly greater risk of RRD, and high myopes (greater than 6 dioptres) accounted for approximately 1/3 of the presentations. A history of cataract surgery was also noted to be a significant risk factor for RRD. A subsequent investigation documented in this thesis determined the rate of RRD following cataract surgery using phaco-emulsification techniques was 1%. The risk for pseudo-phakic patients was inversely related to age. The initial survey revealed approximately 2/3 of the patients presented with macula-off RRDs. While individually many of these patients did well, as a group the functional improvement following surgery was limited and less than 1/3 of eyes achieved LogMAR 0.3. It was not always apparent what factors negatively impacted on the functional prognosis but certainly those individuals requiring more than one surgery tended to fare worse. The impact of a poor visual outcome was not directly assessed in this thesis but it is likely those individuals do suffer in terms of visual functioning and quality of life issues. In New Zealand there are a number of agencies that care and support visually impaired persons but there is inadequate data to assess and benchmark treatment and rehabilitation. If this could be achieved for patients with RRD then those barriers which potentially restrict successful outcomes might provide useful insight for other individuals with visual impairment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the regulation of the somatotrophic axis : with particular reference to the growth hormone receptor</field><field name="creator">Ambler, Geoffrey Richard</field><field name="description">The somatotrophic axis plays a vital role in the hormonal regulation of growth and intermediary metabolism. It encompasses the regulation of pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion from the pituitary gland, the actions of GH on peripheral tissues via interactions with specific growth hormone receptors (GHR) and subsequent endocrine, paracrine and autocrine events, many of which are mediated via the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and its regulators. There are multiple effectors and points of regulation within the axis, including feedback loops, functioning to maintain homeostasis of the organism in physiological and pathophysiological situations. This thesis focuses on a number of studies of GH action and the GH receptor and its regulation, and subsequent processes mediated via the IGF system. Specific aims include further understanding the role of GH and the GHR in fetal and early life, exploring the interaction of other hormones (particularly placental lactogen and somatostatin) with the somatotrophic axis and examining the somatotrophic axis in a rapidly growing tissue (the antler) which does not appear to express the GHR. The ontogenic and GH regulation of the hepatic GHR (as reflected by hepatic bovine GH (bGH) specific binding) and serum GH binding protein (GHBP) were studied in the pig. Marked age-related increases were seen in serum GHBP and hepatic bGH binding, and both were increased by recombinant porcine GH treatment in infant and pubertal animals. Serum IGF-I correlated significantly with serum GHBP and hepatic bGH specific binding. Serum GHBP levels reflected major changes in the hepatic GHR, but not closely in pubertal animals, suggesting some differential regulation. Also, the low levels of hepatic GHR in the infant pig were inducible by GH, suggesting GH responsiveness and a role for GH in early life. In further exploring the role of GH in early life, GH (but not IGF-I) administration to neonatal dwarf rats was found to have small but significant somatogenic effects on growth, serum IGF-I and body composition, with an associated decrease in hepatic bGH specific binding. These studies support a role for GH and GH responsiveness in the neonatal rat. This concept was able to be explored indirectly in the human by studying birth weight and early growth in GH-deficient infants. These infants were short at birth with relative adiposity, and had impaired longitudinal growth in the first year of life, suggesting some GH-dependence of growth in fetal life and early infancy. In investigating the perinatal changes in the GHR and serum IGF-I levels, post-mature fetuses were found to have much lower hepatic bGH specific binding than neonatal lambs of the same post-conceptional age, suggesting that these increases relate to events at parturition, and not to post-conceptional age or intrinsic timing. Thus, while evidence is emerging for a significant role of GH and the GHR in fetal life, major induction of these somatotrophic axis components appears to be inhibited until after birth. Since placental lactogen (PL) has been suggested as having an important role in fetal growth and metabolism, the binding properties and somatogenic properties of ovine PL (oPL) were explored. Studies in dwarf rats demonstrated somatogenic effects of oPL which were in some instances greater than those of bGH. Receptor binding studies in rat and sheep livers consistently showed greater potency of oPL, although with detailed displacement studies in sheep showing parallel changes in oPL and bGH binding over a range of developmental stages. This and other supporting evidence suggest that oPL may interact with the GHR or a closely related receptor, although the possibility of a distinct oPL receptor cannot be conclusively discounted. While the GHR is clearly of major importance in the regulation of growth in many tissues, no GHRs were demonstrated in deer antler by autoradiography or radioreceptor assays. Specific binding sites were identified for IGF-I and IGF-II, with properties suggestive of the type 1 and type 2 IGF receptors. Thus, endocrine IGF-I is proposed to have a prominent role in antler growth, although local IGF production and action is also likely to be important. Finally, in exploring other potential regulators of the GHR, the possibility of direct effects of somatostatin on the GHR was examined, since somatostatin has been suggested to influence the peripheral somatotrophic axis by reducing GH-induced IGF-I expression. Octreotide administration was associated with decreased IGF-I expression, yet with increases in hepatic GHR expression, suggesting that the suppressive effects of octreotide on IGF-I metabolism are not mediated via downregulation of GHR expression, but more likely by direct effects on IGF-I expression. The studies in this thesis have furthered the understanding of some aspects of the role and regulation of GH and the GHR in the somatotrophic axis. Many questions remain to be answered on the complicated role played by these systems in the regulation of growth and metabolism.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fetal origins hypothesis in twin children : a metabolic evaluation</field><field name="creator">Jefferies, Craig Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis explores whether low birth weight affects glucose homeostasis and other aspects of the metabolic syndrome in twin children. The key parameter studied is insulin resistance, and whether insulin resistance is also associated with abnormalities in blood pressure or other aspects of the metabolic syndrome. This thesis is a comparison of twins to singletons, rather than being a study of these traits within twin pairs. The fetal origins hypothesis suggests that low birth weight ultimately is associated with adult onset diseases namely coronary heart disease, glucose intolerance and hypertension. All twins to a degree are born prematurely and with low birth weight. It is unclear whether their metabolism in later life reflects this, or alternatively reflects their uniqueness as twins irrespective of birth weight. This thesis reviews how adaptation for their unique fetal life has affected in particular, glucose homeostasis in twins. Insulin resistance has been consistently identified prior to the onset of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and is also the primary metabolic abnormality persisting from programming of the undernourished fetus. Both small-for-gestational-age and prematurely born infants are insulin resistant when examined in mid-childhood. It has been postulated that this represents an attempt of the fetus to salvage itself from a state of inadequate nutrition. Twins when examined in this thesis are also shown to be insulin resistant, or to have a reduction in insulin sensitivity. This insulin resistance was independent of low birth weight and prematurity, and reflected a unique twin effect. Examing blood pressure precisely revealed that twins had increased night-time blood pressure, a feature also seen in a variety of pre-hypertensive states. However, there was no association between low birth weight and any 24 hour blood pressure monitoring parameter in twins. Twins also had elevated leptin levels but reduced TNF-alpha levels in twins irrespective of birth weight or prematurity. Twins have unique metabolic profiles which are not correlated with low birth weight, and twins should be considered an exception to the fetal origins hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-function relationships in plant terpene synthases</field><field name="creator">Green, Sol Alexander</field><field name="description">Terpene synthases (TPS) are a family of enzymes responsible for synthesising the vast array of terpenoid compounds known to exist in nature. In plants these compounds serve to increase ecological fitness, while commercially they represent one of the key compound classes in determining the quality of food products, including flavour and aroma in fruit crops. Preliminary functional characterisation of an apple (Malus x domestica) TPS responsible for the production of &#945;-farnesene (MdAFS1), which constitutes the major terpene volatile in apple, showed novel features not previously reported for a TPS enzyme. These included the apparent ability of MdAFS1 to generate &#945;-farnesene by a prenyltransferase reaction and being the first angiosperm TPS with a dependence on potassium for activity. The focus of this PhD study was to extend the preliminary functional analysis of MdAFS1 and provide definitive proof for this prenyltransferase activity and also the location and nature of the MdAFS1 potassium binding region. In the research presented here, mutagenesis of the MdAFS1 aspartate-rich divalent metal ion binding motif removed TPS and prenyltransferase activities, showing not only that MdAFS1 possessed intrinsic prenyltransferase function but that both TPS and prenyltransferase catalysis were occurring through the same active site. Protein modelling also revealed a surface-exposed loop (H-&#945;l loop) in MdAFS1 that fulfilled the necessary requirements for a potassium binding region. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of specific residues within this loop then revealed their crucial importance to this potassium response and strongly implicated specific residues in direct potassium binding. The role of the H-&#945;l loop in terpene synthase potassium coordination was confirmed in a conifer pinene synthase also using site-directed mutagenesis. These findings provide the first direct evidence for a specific potassium binding region in two functionally and phylogenetically divergent terpene synthases. They also provide a basis for understanding potassium activation in other TPS enzymes and establish a new role for the H-&#945;l loop region in TPS catalysis. Structural insights were also sought for how MdAFS1 might have evolved from an ancestral mono-TPS enzyme. A combination of contact mapping and mutagenesis analysis identified a single non-synonymous nucleotide substitution that could explain one route for the requisite shift in substrate specificity necessary for &#945;-farnesene synthesis. Abstract II Taken together, the work presented in this thesis provides the foundation for future investigation into the catalytic mechanisms and evolution of plant terpene synthases. Broadening the scope of this and related studies so as to begin unravelling the complex interplay between plant ecological fitness and TPS catalytic specificity still remains an enormous future challenge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of New Zealand nephrite for forensic purposes</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Gareth Peter</field><field name="description">This study investigated the discrimination between sources of the semi-precious mineral, nephrite, by a targeted microanalytical determination of the elemental composition, including the trace elements. Nephrite specimens were collected from two significant nephrite sources in New Zealand, namely the Westland and Wakatipu fields, and combined with donated specimens from the Southland field to complete a representative collection of New Zealand nephrite.  A small number of nephrite specimens were donated from the South Westland nephrite field and from foreign sources.  Representative fragments of these specimens were analysed by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) for major elements and by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for trace elements. The data obtained by the analytical procedure were treated within a compositional data (CoDa) framework of statistical analysis that focuses on the relative sizes of the components in the data set.  The data were transformed under the guidelines of the CoDa framework, where appropriate, and the transformed data were treated with standard statistical methods for exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction and discriminant analysis.  Advances were made to the Hotelling&#8217;s   method for comparison of multivariate means by incorporating a permutation evaluation step.  This permutation method removes the requirement for multivariate normality, and it also allows comparisons to be made when there are many more variables than observations, as is often the case when objects are being characterized using elemental data. The strategy used in this study showed that it is possible to discriminate between sources of nephrite at both an intra- and inter-source level within New Zealand.  In addition, an exploratory investigation showed that New Zealand nephrite could be differentiated from the few nephrite specimens from foreign sources that were available for comparison. Recommendations are made for the protection of the New Zealand nephrite resource and for casework, based on the results obtained in this study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forensic science</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">compositional data analysis</field><field name="subject">nephrite</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compression deformation of glass fibre reinforcements in composites manufacturing processes</field><field name="creator">Somashekar, Arcot Arumugam</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 06/2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the notion of interdependence, and the dynamics of willingness to communicate</field><field name="creator">Cao, Yiqian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 12/2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular disease risk factors and diabetes in Pacific adults: The Diabetes Heart and Health Study (DHAH), Auckland, New Zealand 2002/03</field><field name="creator">Sundborn, Gerhard Benjamin McDonald</field><field name="description">This thesis aims were to describe health related socio-economic profiles, alcohol consumption patterns, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (known and undiagnosed) and to quantify levels of overweight and obesity and other cardiovascular disease risk factors among adults of Pacific ethnic groups and to compare these findings to Europeans in Auckland, New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand&#8217;s Pop Renaissance: A creative industry as &#8216;after neo-liberal&#8217; social policy</field><field name="creator">Scott, Michael William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until March 2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Madness in context in the Histories of Herodotus</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Abigail Rebecca</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the way Herodotus uses madness in his Histories. It aims to examine the changing nature of madness depending on the context in which Herodotus uses it. I also examine some examples of madness in the works of Homer, the Tragedians and the Hippocratic corpus in order to illuminate the varying examples from the Histories. This required close reading of all works in question in the original Ancient Greek as well as examination of secondary literature on the authors and topics concerned. Herodotus&#8217; use of madness varies according to the context in which he uses it, so he does not have a coherent view of madness. Madness, as Herodotus employs the concept, is often violent, but not always physically; it may be verbal or may be used of a person who expresses a violent idea. Sometimes it is a divine punishment; sometimes it signals transgression against divine law. He also uses madness as a literary device to highlight themes of the various logoi, and to reflect not only the state of the one called mad, but the one who is using the term. His usage is similar in some ways to each of the works of Homer, the Tragedians and the Hippocratic writers. In conclusion, madness is a device which Herodotus uses to good effect depending on what effect he wishes to make at the time, in a specific logos.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-wait-citizen: narratives of lived experiences of older persons with depression in Macau</field><field name="creator">Zeng, Wen</field><field name="description">Three meta-categories are drawn from the dominant categories and themes reflected across the findings; physical/material meta-category, social/family meta-category, and mental suffering meta-category.

The associated explanatory framework models the relationships between the three meta-categories. Each interacts with the others, consequently one meta-category both causes and also results from others. The three metacategories capture their life-long hardship and bio-psycho-social-cultural disability, which lay at the root of their negative thinking. The consequences and impacts of their negative thinking appear to feed and sustain depression among the older persons. Findings from this study offer a deeper understanding of the nature and meaning of the negative feelings experienced by this depressed population in Macau. Through its fully grounded interpretative research approach, the present study has advanced previous research describing depression among Chinese older person by allowing a wider and more complete picture to be produced.

This gives rise to multi-objective optimisation. We discuss a range of different bi-objective routing or transportation problems, in particular the shortest path, integer minimum cost flow, and traffic assignment problems. The first part of this thesis is dedicated to the bi-objective shortest path problem. The problem is presented together with several well-known solution algorithms, namely bi-objective labelling, ranking, and the Two Phase method. Computational experiments highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms for different types of problem instances. We introduce new variations of the algorithms above and propose an easily implemented improvement for bi-objective labelling. Cyclist route choice in road networks is presented as a new application of the bi-objective shortest path problem, where cyclists aim to reach their destination in minimal travel time, but also along a safe route. For the bi-objective integer minimum cost flow problem, we introduce one of the first solution algorithms based on the Two Phase method and demonstrate its performance based on different types of problem instances. An improvement of the algorithm for the transportation problem, a special case, is also discussed. Finally, multi-objective traffic assignment is discussed. Traffic assignment is the process of modelling route choice of users of a (road) network in order to determine the total traffic on each road of the network. This is an equilibrium problem as the route choice of one traveller affects other travellers. We show how, traditionally, multiple objectives are treated in traffic assignment, often by combining them into a generalised cost function which may entail strong assumptions on road user behaviour. Instead, we suggest to explicitly distinguish the objectives in a multi-objective framework. We discuss existing literature, which is of mainly theoretical nature, and comment on several articles presenting erroneous results. We contribute to the understanding of the theoretical concepts of vector equilibrium, vector variational inequalities, and vector optimisation. For the solution of bi-objective traffic assignment, we propose novel heuristic algorithms based on bi-objective shortest path algorithms as an important building block.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dual-focus inhibition of myopia evaluation in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Anstice, Nicola</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 01/2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A consideration of homeostatic regulation of eating from the perspective of Maharishi Vedic Science</field><field name="creator">Lovell-Smith, Hugh David</field><field name="description">How humans regulate eating and why regulation fails in many people is not well understood. Obesity has reached unprecedented proportions. Diabetes and heart disease are among a range of illnesses associated with excessive caloric intake and poor energy balance. A theory of food regulation is proposed within a paradigm sufficiently broad to encompass and integrate mind and body. The theory states that homeostatic eating occurs when the pleasure of eating fulfils the desire to eat. It is suggested that absent, unrecognised or misinterpreted eating sensations represent missing key afferent information in homeostatic eating such that eating is not fully pleasurable for some people. Externally oriented attention and recoded perception may account for the non-recognition of key eating sensations. The theory offers an explanation as to why so-called normal eaters may suffer from disorders ranging from coronary artery disease to autoimmune diseases. The theory predicts that relatively simple means could alleviate many such diseases and suggests how to test this prediction. If upheld, the theory could assist people to maintain their own well being and could help to prevent and treat some of the major scourges of Western society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organosolv delignification of willow: Kinetics, recovery and use</field><field name="creator">MacFarlane, Alan L.</field><field name="description">Pretreatment is critical to the conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals. Willow (Salix spp), consisting mainly of polysaccharides and lignin, was used in this study of lignin in three stages. The delignification reaction using the organosolv process, the recovery of lignin from organosolv spent liquor by precipitation and dissolved air flotation, and the use of lignin for polymer production were studied. A novel method of determining delignification activation energy using fewer pulping experiments was developed. Several reaction rate constants were determined during a single pulping run by examining kinetics at different reaction times with a slowly increasing temperature. The effects of changing ethanol concentration were then investigated using this method. Only the change in pH caused by changing ethanol concentration had a significant effect on delignification rate. Prehydrolysis has been used to selectively remove hemicellulose prior to organosolv pulping. De-ashing is a treatment to remove the acid-neutralising components (ash and extractives) of biomass. It was previously thought that organosolv delignification proceeded faster after prehydrolysis due to increased accessibility of solvent to lignin. However, prehydrolysis did not result in faster subsequent delignification compared to de-ashing. De-ashing and prehydrolysis treatments removed the acid neutralising components of wood while prehydrolysis also removed a portion of the polysaccharides. It may be the lower pH resulting from prehydrolysis that increases subsequent organosolv delignification rate compared to untreated feedstock. Upon dilution of organosolv black liquor, lignin forms a precipitate, which is typically removed by filtration or centrifugation. The use of dissolved air flotation (DAF) presents a low cost alternative that utilizes the hydrophobicity of organosolv lignin. The parameters important to the dissolved air flotation of organosolv lignin were studied using fractional factorial design. Fastest flotation occurs when saturation pressure is high and black liquor-water mixing is rapid resulting in the redistribution of micro-bubbles Abstract iii during floc formation. Precipitation must occur below 35&#176;C to cause sufficient flocculation. Phenol formaldehyde resins were prepared with 20% w/w of the phenol replaced by lignin (lignin-PF resin). Lignin-PF resins prepared from the most depolymerised lignin had comparable strength to pure PF resin when strength was compared using a lap joint test.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the internal failure mechanics of lumbar intervertebral discs</field><field name="creator">Veres, Samuel Peter</field><field name="description">While several mechanical disruption studies of lumbar intervertebral discs have previously been carried out in vitro, none have sought to examine the microstructure of the resulting tissue failures.

Postcolonial fiction in New Zealand and Australia draws on pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial narratives of landscape to create compelling representations of place and people. In the adult fiction of New Zealand author Maurice Gee and Australian author David Malouf, characters typically turn to the landscape at moments of crisis or transition. Close analysis of Gee&#8217;s and Malouf&#8217;s fiction demonstrates that the physical environment serves as a touchstone for personal and national identity throughout personal and national histories. From childhood to old age, characters seek self-definition by locating themselves within their physical environment, rather than by directly referencing their social or cultural context. Individual life stages are shown to be analogous to early stages of national development for New Zealand and Australia &#8211; the journey from colonial child to mature identity for both the individual and the nation is figured through landscape images. However, Gee and Malouf also use the relationship between characters and landscape to reflect social attitudes and values, demonstrating a connection between confident identification with the &#8216;other&#8217; of the landscape and the ability to integrate meaningfully with the &#8216;others&#8217; of human society. Thus landscape functions in these texts as a means of both reflecting and constructing identity in postcolonial New Zealand and Australia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constitutional conflicts and aboriginal rights: hunting, fishing and gathering rights in Canada, New Zealand and the United States</field><field name="creator">Charlton, Guy</field><field name="description">Judicial resolution of non-aboriginal conflicts was crucial to the vindication of indigenous rights within the new state as the determination of the nature and quality of aboriginal legal interests and entitlements involved fundamental questions of land ownership, secure legal title for settler alienation, as well as governmental priority and competence. If not for these disputes, court decisions and common law doctrine solicitous of indigenous interests based on the idea of indigenous occupancy, use and possession of their territory, and the creation of law based on colonial and imperial policy -- which incorporated notions of indigenous sovereignty and supported pluralist legal relations -- would have been discarded by the courts due to the underlying dynamism and logic of colonialism. Using a recent judicial decision by the highest court in each jurisdiction as a window to discuss the various approaches courts have taken to usufructuary rights, this thesis discusses the major components of the legal doctrine of hunting, fishing and gathering rights in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. It argues that the judicial protection of these aboriginal or treaty rights have been profoundly affected by non-aboriginal disputes over the constitution and the nature of national polity. At the same time the analysis suggests that values &#8213;external to the law are not the sole determinant of judicial outcomes over time. Rather in certain instances the legal doctrine and decisions implicate values inherent to the legal system, such as a conceptual commitment to a logical internal structure, a respect for precedent and previous governmental policy as well as the principle that courts are disinterested dispensers of neutral justice. These internal values comingle with deep-seated commitments held by individual decision-makers and the judiciary more generally, regarding the constitutional structure of the state and the role of the judiciary.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second chances: youth justice co-ordinators&#8217; perspectives on the youth justice family group conference process.</field><field name="creator">Slater, Christine Marie</field><field name="description">In New Zealand&#8217;s system of Youth Justice (YJ) the Family Group Conference (FGC) process plays a pivotal role in addressing the offending behaviour of young people under seventeen. Mandated under the Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act 1989 (the Act), the FGC is a formal meeting in which the persons most affected by a young person&#8217;s offending, typically the young person, their family, their victim(s) and associated professionals, collectively decide how the young person should be held accountable. The process is managed by a YJ Co-ordinator, appointed by the Department of Child, Youth and Family (the Department). This dissertation presents the findings of an evaluation of the YJ FGC process from the perspectives of YJ Co-ordinators. The study aimed to understand the process and the development of practice, to identify factors constituting best practice and current areas of weakness in the process. It comprised of semi-structured interviews with (n=19) YJ Co-ordinators with at least twelve years&#8217; practitioner experience (Project One) and four focus groups (n=27) of Co-ordinators with a range of practice (Project Two). Three major themes emerged from the thematic analysis of data: a) The Act as Anchor &#8211; philosophical underpinnings of the FGC process, b) Working with the Act &#8211; best practice and current issues in YJ FGC service provision, and c) The Office &#8211; organisational factors. The results indicated the YJ FGC process was effective for the majority of young people, but generally inadequate for recidivist young offenders with complex additional needs. Aspects of best practice included: aligned professional approaches to FGC philosophy and practice, service delivery by trained YJ Co-ordinators and the quality of FGC preparation. Also considered best practice was the inclusion of victims in the process to assist in the development of a strengths-based personalised plan for the young person. With several areas of weakness identified, recommendations for improving the process included: addressing Co-ordinator training and Departmental leadership, reviewing the process for recidivists, improving process information quality, enhancing professional collaboration and addressing Police training in the Act and the FGC.

This study explores a key issue: the role and importance of imagination in the developmental stages of spiritual intelligence in students within each of these groups. By comparing students in a Catholic integrated school with those in a State intermediate school, it identifies both similarities and differences that teachers need to take into account in carrying out their professional responsibilities. The study begins by analysing and explaining concepts of spiritual intelligence that are often a source of ambiguity and confusion for teachers. It draws on a well-established hierarchal stage developmental theory of spiritual intelligence, but supplements this with a corresponding account of the role of imagination in the formation of spiritual intelligence at each of these stages. Spiritual intelligence is based on a theistic definition and its development on the imagination side of cognition rather than emotions. This results in the development of a nine stage taxonomy which is tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The research design examines seven important social factors, or variables, affecting the development of spiritual intelligence: school age group (intermediate, middle and senior), gender (male and female), school sample type (gifted and talented and average mainstream), areas of giftedness and talent (bodily-kinaesthetic, logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, interpersonal and environmental), type of school (state and integrated), ethnicity (New Zealand European and others) and religion (Catholic, non-Catholic Christians, other religions and no religion). Using Fisher's Exact Test of variance, current trends in the spiritual intelligence characteristics of students are identified. The study provides teachers with four statistically verified tasks, their respective criterion referenced task assessment schedules (CRS) and exemplars for assessing stages of development of spiritual intelligence in students. The findings of this research project will help teachers of Values Education and Religious Education, Directors of Religious Studies (DRS) and Boards of Trustees in Catholic integrated schools to understand the theoretical and pedagogical principles of spiritual development, enabling them to design research-based programmes for advancing spiritual intelligence in their students.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and simulation of the filling and post-filling stages of the resin infusion process</field><field name="creator">Govignon, Quentin Paul Nic&#233;phore Marc Marie</field><field name="description">The doctoral research presented in this thesis is focused on the resin infusion moulding process. The resin infusion process is part of the liquid composite moulding family where a dry reinforcement is impregnated with a liquid resin inside a closed mould to form a composite part. The specificity of resin infusion resides in the fact that only one side of the mould is rigid, the cavity being sealed by a vacuum bag. The preform compaction and fluid flow are driven by the pressure difference between the cavity and the ambient pressure. The reinforcement can therefore exhibit through thickness deformation as the resin penetrates the cavity. The aim of the research was to monitor and simulate the process. A number of previous studies have considered the impregnation process, but very little work had focused on the post-filling stage of the process, once the resin inlet is closed and the resin pressure field inside the mould is left to equilibrate.  In the first part of this study, the behaviour of two different fibrous reinforcements was experimentally characterised, and a new model was developed to replicate the compaction behaviour of the reinforcements. This model is based on elastic behaviour, but was able to account for the compaction history of the reinforcement.  A comprehensive monitoring system was designed and built to collect relevant experimental data to be compared with the simulation. This included i  the development of a mould fitted with sensors, as well as a stereophotogrammetry system which provides full field monitoring of variations in reinforcement properties. This system measures local cavity thickness, allowing calculation of other parameters such as fibre volume fraction and permeability.  A 1D finite element simulation of the resin infusion process is subsequently presented. The simulation covers both the filling and post-filling stages of the process and uses a modified version of Darcy&#8217;s law to govern the flow of fluid through porous media.

The focus is on how the health clinic works as a pedagogical environment where lessons are offered by clinicians to women patients (often unwittingly) about morality, femininity and the body. Of central concern is the question of how health professionals might contribute to women's quality of life after a viral STI diagnosis. I use examples of the reported engagement between clinicians, women and the two most common viral STIs, the human papilloma virus (HPV) and the herpes simplex virus (HSV). To consider the effects of the myriad beliefs that inform clinical teaching I draw from poststructuralist feminist discourse theory. For data collection I used in-depth email interviews, a research method that allowed participants with viral STIs to 'speak' more freely than might be possible in face-to-face interviews. The method also readily enabled me to interview sexual health clinicians and other women within a wide geographical area, in New Zealand, Australia, North America and England. My research findings include the insights that: by the time women seek out medical care for a viral STI they have received considerable social 'education' that STIs are categorically different from other conditions; although clinicians emphasise the normalcy of viral STIs they tend to have limited knowledge of the difficulties women face in disruptions to sexuality after a diagnosis. Liberal views about sex do not necessarily make the negotiation of safer heterosexual sex and prevention of STI transmission easier for women. Women found it helpful when clinicians addressed both the medical 'normalcy' of viral STIs and their potential to disrupt women's sense of self, sexual and social relationships. In public health education, gynaecological examinations are presented as a routine and essential practice, yet my study found that such examinations are often difficult for women. Research addressing women's reasons for non-compliance with screening emphasises 'underlying' psychological categories of 'anxiety' and 'poor coping'. Minimal attention is paid to the effects of clinicians' interventions upon women's decision-making. My findings indicate that women's screening compliance is influenced by clinicians' gender, (in) attention to power relations, rapport-building, attentiveness to bodily (dis)comfort, and technical skill. In striving for non-judgmental, scientific teaching, clinicians were often unaware that their talk inevitably constituted viral STIs as 'moral' infections. Clinicians may best contribute to women's lives by acknowledging that medical discourse is only one part of the fragmentary and contradictory education women receive about bodies and selves.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface properties and finishing of aluminium casting alloys</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Chuong Luu</field><field name="description">Aluminium alloys are materials of huge practical importance. However their use is dependent on surface oxides and hydroxides which are critical in protecting the highly reactive underlying metal. The stability and integrity of the oxides and hydroxides are also crucial in finishing and bonding applications. Better understanding of these surfaces has significant implications in enhancing their application. LM6 and LM25 aluminium-silicon casting alloys were studied as these materials show a particularly inhomogeneous phase structure and complex surface behaviour. This complexity is of fundamental interest and leads to considerable practical difficulties, especially in surface finishing. The surfaces were characterised, subjected to thermal treatments and modified with Ion Assisted Deposition coatings of TiN. A characterisation method for these surfaces was also developed based around the layered structure of aluminium hydroxides. It was observed that the thermally induced surface segregation of minor elements, such as Mg and Na, is availability-limited. Surface concentrations of these elements are determined by the net effect of enriching via surface segregation and depleting through surface evaporation. The inhomogeneous phase structure of the alloys used in this study enables the observation of two migration processes driven by different forces. Below the oxide dominated surface layer, the migration of Mg is driven by chemical potential gradient and is primarily perpendicular to the surface. Closer to the surface, concentration driven horizontal diffusion of the element occurs. The deposition of a thin TiN layer has been used to probe the interface. While the deposition conditions of TiN coatings affect the chemistry of the coatings, substrate surface conditions determine how well bonding is achieved between the film and substrate. The height difference between silicon particles in the eutectic phase and the primary aluminium phase of the casting alloys provides surface roughening and optimal adhesion through mechanical interlocking with the coating. This height difference is achieved by preferentially removing the surface exposed primary aluminium phases with ion bombardment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the interactions of the beta7 integrin cytoplasmic domain</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yih-Chih</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 03/2012, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe: the centrality of M&#257;tauranga-a-iwi to M&#257;ori education.</field><field name="creator">Doherty, William</field><field name="description">The general aim of this thesis is to improve understanding about the place of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi in the education system. In the modern education system, the linked terms m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory are used to define M&#257;ori identity and M&#257;ori knowledge. But this thesis argues that these concepts must be grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located knowledge within tribal lands. It follows that m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, with their roots in m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, must ultimately be understood as a relationship between the tribal environment and its people. The tribal environment, or rohe, of T&#363;hoe is the illustrative site of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi for this thesis. The rohe for T&#363;hoe is Te Urewera. The relationship that exists between T&#363;hoe and this landscape is outlined mapping this intimate relationship (chapter 2). The thesis does the work of explaining what m&#257;tauranga-a-T&#363;hoe is, and how it has developed through a series of historical engagements. These things were learned by me at the feet of my grandmother (chapter 1). The engagements include: iwi interactions (chapter 6), Pakeha and Crown engagements (chapter 7), with more recent economic realities (chapter 4), and education (chapter 5). The key concepts of m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, and m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, as well as being grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located base, must be viewed as inseparable strands working collectively to enhance the understanding of the other. The indivisible strands are presented in a diagrammatic form (chapter 3). By mapping the complexities of what is m&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe (chapter 8) this thesis illustrates the level of detailed understanding that needs to be included in the education system in order for m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory to be properly understood and engaged for M&#257;ori educational success.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Emissions from Aluminium Electrolysis Cells</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Edwin Campbell</field><field name="description">Modern aluminium electrolysis cells generate between 15 to 40 kg fluoride per tonne of aluminium fluoride produced. This represent a large material recycle load, of which over 99% of this fluoride content is returned to the cell via a dry scrubbing system. Most past research has concentrated on increasing the efficiency of this end scrubbing system, neglecting the actual cause of the fluoride emissions. Lower emissions would reduce this loading, resulting in smaller scrubbing systems, and ultimately lower capital costs. Fluoride emissions also contribute to the changes in heat balance in the cell. The fluoride evolved represents a material loss that requires to be replaced with AlF3. The addition of this species is a major variable in cell heat balance instability [1]. Overall a better understanding of the contributors to fluoride generation in an aluminium cell would benefit the operation and economics of an aluminium smelter. Past studies [2-6] have identified most of the important emission contributors to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation. Two sources were shown to be significant. The most studied source was primary HF generation. This is HF generation from electrolytic reactions between constituents of the fluoride based electrolyte and water from the fed alumina and hydrogen in the anode. Overlooked in some studies were generation reactions outside the electrolyte - defined in this study as secondary HF generation. This source was found to occur mainly from hydrolysis reactions with the generated particulate fluorides. However the results and the relative contributions from these studies are not strictly applicable to the current generation scenario. The present smelting practices and technology, dry scrubbing technology and raw material specifications differ substantially from those used during the period of each past investigation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify emission sources for the current smelter technology and practices. This used controlled laboratory based studies of the individual generation sources complemented by in plant studies analysing the HF emission from production aluminium electrolysis cells. It was shown that the main contributor to primary HF generation is the addition of water to the electrolyte from the feed alumina. This results in the cyclic short term variations in HF emission, which correlate to the rate of alumina addition to the cell. Laboratory and industrial studies show that only a fraction of the added water reacts. The water reacted is likely the structural water of the alumina. The adsorbed water is thought to be flashed off before addition to the bath. Depending on feeding technology and crust integrity, between 10 to 50% of this water can react. This produces 7 to 14 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the most significant emission component. The remainder of this structural water is either entrained in the anode gases or forms part of the electrolyte dissolved water content. Dissolved water generation is the second most significant primary generation contributor, and third most significant emission component. Dissolved water is in equilibrium with the alumina content of the bath. It represents a constant emission source. Depending on feeding technology and cell design, the emission can vary between 3 to 10 kgF/tonneAl. The final primary HF emission contributor results from electrolytic generation of the hydrogen content of the anode. Laboratory studies found the emission to have a reaction efficiency of approximately 10%. This results in a small emission, of 2 &#8211; 5 kg/tonneAl. The remainder of the hydrogen content is expected to be entrained in the anode gases, as the generation of this CO/CO2 mixture is an order of magnitude greater than the HF generation reaction. Secondary generation of hydrogen fluoride is also a significant HF emission source. In an industrial cell this results from mainly thermal hydrolysis of the particulate fluoride emissions at the crust&#8211;air interface. Laboratory studies have shown that other identified secondary emission sources are unlikely due to the ambient conditions and feeding practices in a modern prebake aluminium electrolysis cell. Hence previously proposed generation from hydrolysis of the particulates in the ducts and desorption of the surface fluoride from the fed secondary alumina, have been found to be insignificant compared to the main HF generation sources. The thermal hydrolysis emission contributor is the only significant secondary generation emission component. Industrial measurements show that it varies with ambient humidity and crust integrity, two parameters which vary constantly in a modern prebake anode cell. Measurements show that the emission from this source is responsible for 2 to 8 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the second highest HF emission component. Control of the crust condition and feeder hole states reduces this component significantly. Hence in a modern prebake aluminium cell, the most significant operational factors affecting emission are related mainly to secondary generation. Industrial measurements show that the long term variations in an emission result from changes in the ambient humidity and the cells crust cover. Control of the crust integrity is thus paramount in reducing such variations. This relates both to normal operation and batch operations. Reduction of all other sources of emission are a material composition problem. Simply reducing the water content (LOI(300) and LOI(1000)) and reducing the hydrogen content of the anodes will reduce the emission. However material considerations affect other aspects of cell operation and hence these factors are not as simple to adjust.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of adolescent obesity in New Zealand: quality of life, psychosocial factors and psychological theory</field><field name="creator">Carne, Sarah S.</field><field name="description">Purpose: To ascertain the quality of life (QOL) in an adolescent population with a high prevalence of obesity, compare findings to previous research, and  investigate psychosocial factors that may account for differences in results by  use of psychological theory.

His greatest poem, "The Prelude" had as its subject matter the growth of his own poetic mind; something that can also be understood as the growth of his 'imagination'. His friend and fellow poet, later turned philosopher, Samuel Taylor Coleridge developed a novel and romantic understanding of 'the Imagination' in the early years of his friendship with Wordsworth. He identified Wordsworth's genius, as a poet, as the product of a particularly gifted imagination, something he conceived of as an innate ability. In this thesis I challenge this 'Romantic' representation of Wordsworth's genius, one that has become canonical, largely as a result of Coleridge's treatment of Wordsworth, Poetry and Imagination in "Biographia Literaria". In making a more detailed analysis of Wordsworth's own claims about his identity, his poetic art, and imagination, I develop an argument that proposes a very different ethos to the one still largely considered normative in English Studies. The argument depends on a better recognition of Wordsworth's Classical Republican sympathies in the 1790s, and the extent to which the example of the famous Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and poet, Marcus Tullius Cicero captured Wordsworth's imagination. Contrary to those who would romanticise Wordsworth's genius, I suggest his best work was the product of a theory of poetry based on principles that defined a very classical ideology. My argument builds on the work of recent, more detailed, representations of Wordsworth as a historical subject whose ideas were defined by particular historical circumstances, and whose identity developed out of those experiences. In addition to paying more attention to the 'historical' Wordsworth, I have also made a detailed analysis of his language, discovering the existence of a particular idiom. Wordsworth's vocabulary reflects, not only a classical humanist ideology, but also strong Stoic sentiments and an attitude of Socratic, Academic Scepticism. I trace the source of this characteristic idiom back to the influence of Cicero whose works, along with Marcus Quintilian's "De Institutione Oratoria" defined key aspects of Wordsworth's poetic theory in the late 1790s and early 1800s.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enfance et d&#233;racinement: Nathalie Sarraute, Romain Gary</field><field name="creator">Diver, Ruth Louise</field><field name="description">Cette th&#232;se examine les enjeux associ&#233;s au d&#233;racinement culturel v&#233;cu dans l&#8217;enfance et ses effets sur la cr&#233;ativit&#233; dans la vie adulte.

However, only limited information on tissue function can be obtained with current clinical techniques. This Thesis developed and investigated novel parameters of both global and regional myocardial function, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with three-dimensional tissue tagging. Multidirectional peak myocardial shortening strains and strain rates, as well as the peak systolic displacement and velocity of the mitral valve annulus plane (MVP), were considered as parameters of LV systolic function. The corresponding peak diastolic strain relaxation rates and peak diastolic MVP velocity were used to assess diastolic function. The effects of normal ageing were studied in people with no evidence of cardiac disease, and compared with the effects of disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In normal healthy subjects, systolic strain parameters were preserved, while diastolic parameters were impaired, with age. DM patients showed impaired diastolic function on correction for age, and systolic functional parameters were also impaired, even though LV ejection fraction was normal. MVP systolic and diastolic motion were reduced both with age and in DM patients. Systolic LV torsion was increased with age and in DM, with no corresponding increase in torsional relaxation. Both systolic and diastolic function parameters were regionally heterogeneous. With normal ageing, diastolic function was impaired in a regionally non-uniform manner. Thus, a complete assessment of LV function requires measurement of LV tissue mechanics as well as chamber haemodynamics. MRI provides valuable information regarding myocardial tissue behaviour, contributing to systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction, which cannot be obtained otherwise. Systolic tissue dysfunction may develop concomitantly in patients with diastolic dysfunction, even when global ejection fraction is preserved. Regional analyses provide important information on how local changes contribute to global function. The influence of age must be taken into account in studies of disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A developmental comparison of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in oculomotor and hypoglossal motoneurons</field><field name="creator">Miles, Gareth B.</field><field name="description">Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are important determinants of neuronal excitability and repetitive discharge behaviour. They are also implicated in perinatal developmental processes and Ca2+ -dependent excitotoxic cascades thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. To understand the role that these channels/receptor systems play in the physiology, ontogeny and pathophysiology of MNs, it is necessary to characterise them, during development, in MNs that differ functionally in the behaviours they control, the firing behaviour they produce, their rate of maturation, and their vulnerability to degeneration in ALS. Surprisingly few studies, however, have characterised these channels/receptor systems in MNs, particularly beyond early postnatal stages. I therefore compared voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I mGluRs in brain slices from neonate (P1-5) and juvenile (P14-19) rat, in oculomotor (III) and hypoglossal (XII) MNs using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and immunohistochemical techniques. III MNs innervate extraocular muscles, control eye movements that are not fully functional in rat until 2 weeks postnatal, fire at high frequency for sustained periods, and are resistant in ALS. In contrast, XII MNs innervate tongue muscles, control behaviours that are functional at birth, fire bursts of low frequency action potentials, and are vulnerable to degeneration in ALS. In neonates, low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ current densities are similar in III and XII MNs but high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ current densities are ~2-fold higher in XII MNs. While N- and P/Q-type HVA Ca2+ channels are present in both MN pools, greater expression of P/Q-type channels in XII MNs accounts for their greater HVA Ca2+ currents. Developmentally, LVA and HVA Ca2+ current densities decrease ~2-fold by P14-19 in III MNs, but remain unchanged in XII MNs. Thus, in juveniles the HVA Ca2+ current density is ~3-fold greater and the LVA ca2+ current density ~2-fold greater in XII compared to III MNs. The group I mGluR agonist, DHPG, induces inward currents in III and XII MNs of neonatal and juvenile rat, which are mediated by the reduction of a resting K+ conductance. Antagonism of these currents by the mGluR1 antagonist LY367385, but not the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, and immunohistochemical labelling for mGluR1a but not mGluR5 protein on III and XII MNs, suggest that currents primarily result from the activation of mGluR1. In neonatal rat the current density of DHPG-induced currents is similar between III and XII MNs. However, in juvenile rat DHPG-induced current density is ~3-fold greater in XII compared with III MNs. Differential expression of LVA and HVA Ca2+ currents and varying effects of group I mGluR activation in III and XII MNs during development supports a role for these channels and receptor systems in determining the distinct firing patterns of these two different classes of MNs. The greater voltage-activated Ca2+ currents and group I mGluR-mediated effects in XII MNs, particularly in juvenile MNs, may also contribute to the greater sensitivity of XII MNs to pathophysiological processes, predisposing them to degeneration as seen in ALS.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science and reason</field><field name="creator">Williams, David Leslie Fairfax</field><field name="description">In this thesis we attempt to undercut the debate between those who argue that because humans are rational and moral creatures it follows that they have to be viewed and studied in a different way to (other) natural beings, and those who argue that because humans are natural beings they can be viewed and studied in much the same way as other natural beings.

The study affirms inscriptions surrounding choice in childbirth are shaped discursively through a multiplicity of discourses underpinned by social and institutional practices. With advances in technology, childbearing women have a greater variety of options from which to choose. Controversial, is the option of a caesarean section, regardless of clinical need. The issue is depicted in both professional and popular discourse as contentious, complex and contradictory. Its momentum into the 21st century, as a new object of obstetric discourse, has been played out on a number of platforms. In this thesis I draw from the theoretical ideas of French philosopher Michel Foucault, to examine this complex debate. I argue there is a volatile moment in the history of childbirth in which an explosion of discourses have sculptured choice for a caesarean, in the absence of clinical indications, out of a repartee of autonomy, convenience, desire, fear and risk. In this precarious moment, new meanings joust with the old on a shifting terrain awash with rhetoric that co-opts, competes, and contradicts to bring about a cach&#233; of mutable &#8216;truths&#8217;. Whether caesarean, as an optional extra, can be explained in terms of a libertarian imperative, an embodiment of lifestyle, the satiation of desire, the attenuation of fear or the avoidance of risk, the democratisation of this choice has exposed a pathologising paradox, whereupon the normal emerges as the abnormal, and the abnormal emerges as the normal. The deconstruction of choice through a poststructuralist lens has enabled insight into how contradiction and contest befall the &#8216;order of things &#8217; and in so doing, provides new openings for contemplating the discursive positioning of women through the competing discourses of childbirth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">caesarean section</field><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

There are a variety of methods for performing super-resolution described in the literature, and in general they consist of three major steps: image registration, fusion and deblurring. This thesis proposes a novel method of performing the first two of these steps. The ultimate aim of image super-resolution is to produce a higher-quality image that is visually clearer, sharper and contains more detail than the individual input images. Machine algorithms can not assess images qualitatively and typically use a quantitative error criterion, often least-squares. This thesis aims to optimise leastsquares directly using a fast method, in particular one that can be implemented using linear filters; hence, a closed-form solution is required. The concepts of optimal interpolation and resampling are derived and demonstrated in practice. Optimal filters optimised on one image are shown to perform nearoptimally on other images, suggesting that common image features, such as stepedges, can be used to optimise a near-optimal filter without requiring the knowledge of the ground-truth output. This leads to the construction of a pulse model, which is used to derive filters for resampling non-uniformly sampled images that result from the fusion of registered input images. An experimental comparison shows that a 10th order pulse model-based filter outperforms a number of methods common in the literature. The use of optimal interpolation for image registration linearises an otherwise nonlinear problem, resulting in a direct solution. Experimental analysis is used to show that optimal interpolation-based registration outperforms a number of existing methods, both iterative and direct, at a range of noise levels and for both heavily aliased images and images with a limited degree of aliasing. The proposed method offers flexibility in terms of the size of the region of support, offering a good trade-off in terms of computational complexity and accuracy of registration. Together, optimal interpolation-based registration and fusion are shown to perform fast, direct and effective super-resolution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image resolution</field><field name="subject">optimal filters</field><field name="subject">optimal interpolation</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software::291601 Arithmetic and logic structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uterine involution in the dairy cow : comparative study between organic and conventional dairy cows : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for degree of Masters of Science in Animal Science, Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Dobson-Hill, Brenna Catherine</field><field name="description">Organic dairying is growing in popularity in New Zealand and the demand for knowledge is ever increasing. Many more farmers are considering organics as an alternative to their current conventional system. However, limited information is available on organic dairying in a New Zealand pastoral situation particularly in relation to its effect on fertility. The New Zealand dairy industry requires the dairy cow to become pregnant every year at the same time to maximise milk production and utilise the high pasture production in spring. A cow requires 40 to 60 days for uterine involution to occur and for resumption of oestrous cycles. It is critical that the cow becomes pregnant within the six to eight week mating period, however, this can be difficult for late calvers or those cows that had or still have a uterine infection, to undergo uterine involution and be successfully mated. These cows will often not become pregnant and as a consequence be culled for infertility. During the first few weeks postpartum, the bacterial composition of the uterus fluctuates as a result of spontaneous contamination, elimination and recontamination. Most cows are able to eliminate these bacteria, however, 10 to 17% of cows are unable to do this. In these cows, the bacteria persist, cause infection and inflammation, and delay uterine involution. The main objective of this present study was to investigate the effect of different management systems (Organic and Conventional) on productivity and reproduction, particularly the process of uterine involution and its relationship with reproductive outcomes. Uterine involution will be studied through the following measurements: cervical diameter as assessed by measurement per rectum, plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids and bacteriology of the uterus. Lactation characteristics: milk yield, cumulative milk yield, milksolids production and somatic cell count will also be investigated. From the results, it can be concluded that Organic cows have reduced milk yield (P=0.05) and milksolids production (P&lt;0.01) through there were no major differences at peak lactation or in the rate of decline after. However, overall somatic cell count was not affected by management system though the Conventional cows had high somatic cell counts in early lactation (P=0.925). Cervical diameter was affected by the management system with the difference between Organic and Conventional cows almost significant (P=0.06). Cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in Organic cows (0.68 &#177; 0.08 ng/ml) when compared to Conventional cows (0.95 &#177; 0.06 ng/ml) (P=0.01). Cortisol concentrations decreased over time postpartum (P&lt;0.01). Additionally Organic cows had a shorter interval from calving to AI (P=0.017). However, none of the other reproductive outcomes were affected by management system. Simple correlations established that reproductive outcomes and bacterial counts, reproductive outcomes and cortisol at Day seven, and cortisol and milk production characteristics, were not independent of each other. Aerobic bacterial counts on Day 28 and the interval from calving to AI were found to be significantly correlated (r= 0.615). Stepwise partial regression analysis, plus analysis of variance calculated on the relationships between uterine involution parameters and reproductive outcomes found multiple weak correlations. It found that cervical diameter, and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts on Day 28 were significantly correlated with the interval from calving to first AI (P=0.018). The differences in lactation characteristics are related to the lower pasture production on the organic farmlet reducing the maximal potential milk production and the possibly earlier calving dates of the Conventional cows. The differences in bacterial counts and almost significant difference in cervical diameter may be related to the lower cortisol levels and thus suggest that the Organic cows may be less stressed. As stress suppresses the immune system, it may be possible that the higher bacterial counts are indicitative of a less efficient or slightly weakened immune system which takes longer to eliminate bacteria in the uterus; however this is open to conjecture. The shorter interval from calving to AI suggests that Organic cows may be exhibiting oestrus behaviour earlier postpartum or the Conventional cows are having &#8220;silent heats&#8221; but this difference is possibly related to human factors. The correlation between parameters of uterine involution and interval from calving to AI, and the lower values for uterine involution parameters in Organic cows suggest the possibility of faster uterine involution and this may result in better fertility in the Organic cows. More research needs to be carried out to further investigate the effect of organic dairying on uterine involution and reproduction outcomes but organic dairying at the very least does not negatively impact on uterine involution and fertility.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic dairying</field><field name="subject">milk production</field><field name="subject">milk yield</field><field name="subject">cow fertility</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300401 Animal breeding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perversion of the reel : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the completion of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edmunds, Hannah</field><field name="description">Through the use of masculinity as a visual language this research aims to unravel the divide between the role of the act and the acted.

They are highly glycosylated molecules and changes in monosaccharide composition during parasitism have been reported. Effects of parasites on monosaccharide component of fundic and duodenal mucins of sheep were investigated in 3 age ranges (i) 4-4.5, (ii) 6 and (iii) 8-9 months old: (1) noninfected; (2) infected with 10,000 Haemonchus contortus and euthanased 21 days post infection (p.i.); (3) infected with 50,000 Teladorsagia circumcincta and euthanased 28 days p.i. Three days-old lambs and 9 weeks-old lambs: (a) milk-fed, (b) solid-fed and (c) solid-fed, infected with T. circumcincta were also included. The effects of H. contortus and T. circumcincta infection in mucin changes were significantly different in the fundus, however, both of them shared some similarities. Infected sheep showed lower proportion of fucose and sialic acids in fundic and duodenal mucins compared with non-infected animals, the level of sulphation varied depending on the age of infected sheep: decrease in young sheep but increase in older animals. H. contortus infection also caused increased proportions of GlcNAc and Gal in fundic mucins and duodenal mucins respectively at all ages, however, in T. circumcincta infection, it was shown that the alterations of mucins were age-dependent. T. circumcincta infected sheep showed the significant changes at young ages (4-6 months-old) while 8-9 months-old animals showed less change in fundic mucins compared with non-infected animals. Effects of H. contortus and T. circumcincta infection differed in the fundic mucins but were similar in the duodenum. The study showed that parasitism caused the modifications of monosaccharide composition in gastrointestinal mucins of sheep. These alterations may result from parasite species differences, causing different effects from the host&#8217;s immune response. The changes in mucin profiles observed in the duodenum of sheep infected with abomasal nematodes suggested that the host may respond to parasitism. This would facilitate the use of mucins from accessible sources, without euthanasing the animals, to investigate the changes in mucin compositions which can be used to diagnose the susceptibility or resistance of sheep to parasites</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Parasites</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300508 Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Musculoskeletal discomfort in veterinarians : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Ergonomics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Scuffham, Andrew Mark</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Appendix 6: Paper presented at the 15th New Zealand Ergonomics Society Conference: Ergonomics for the Ageing Population, Martinborough.

In contrast to conventional routine processes and accumulation of learning, these events represent a flashpoint in our educational lives. Critical events pertain to deep personal meaning and agency. This research investigates the Boscars. This retrospective study is one of interactive ethnography which has strong affinity with symbolic interactionism using a range of qualitative techniques on an event in the recent past. The work was collaborative. Teachers, pupils and other critical agents worked with the researcher to reconstruct and analyse the event with the general purpose of informing and improving local educational practice. It is a celebratory account focused on expressive outcomes, drawing in large measure on teacher and pupil articulations. Respondent validation was important within the context of other tests of validity. One of these tests is the ability of the research to strengthen the participants in their work and to influence other practitioners &#8211; in other words for the research to share the criticality of the event. These criteria apply to the extent to which the account facilitates the drawing of inferences that may have application in other contexts or situations.

Most importantly, outrigger-braced structures can strengthen a building without disturbing its aesthetic appearance and this is a significant advantage over other lateral load resisting systems.

Although no clinical signs of fat malabsorption were observed the subject was diagnosed, on the basis of his low cholesterol and apolipoprotein B level, as having hypobetalipoproteinaemia.  The variant of apolipoprotein B was first identified by Western blot analysis. The analysis revealed an abnormal low molecular weight form of apolipoprotein B as well as normal apolipoprotein B-100 indicating that the subject was heterozygous for a truncated form of apolipoprotein B. The new variant (apo B-32) was a result of a C&#8594;T transition at nucleotide 4548 in exon 26 of the apolipoprotein B gene. This mutation changes a CAG codon which codes for glutamine into a TAG stop codon resulting in translation of a truncated apolipoprotein B protein approximately 32% the length of normal apolipoprotein B-100.  Although only 32% of the length of apolipoprotein B-100, apo B-32 was still capable of forming lipoprotein particles as indicated by its presence in both the low density and high density lipoprotein fractions. This density distribution is unique since apo B-32 is the shortest known truncated apolipoprotein B to be found in the low density lipoprotein fraction. This finding clearly indicates that the region of apo B-32 is important in the lipid binding characteristics of apolipoprotein B-100. The binding of apo B-32 to heparin confirmed three heparin binding sites previously predicted to be in the amino-terminal 30% of apolipoprotein B-100.  Isolated lipoproteins formed from apo B-32 appeared to be similar to high density lipoproteins in size and composition. However, unlike high density lipoproteins, the apo B-32 lipoproteins in plasma were partially precipitated by polyanionlcation reagents normally used to precipitate very low density and low density lipoproteins. The presence of both apolipoproteins Al and E on the apo B-32 lipoproteins suggested that apolipoprotein Al or E may mediate the metabolism of apo B-32 since apo B-32 does not posses the receptor binding region for the low density lipoprotein receptor.  Four further subjects were identified as having reduced low density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B concentrations. However a lack of any truncated apolipoprotein B in their plasma made it difficult to link their hypobetalipoproteinaemia with the apolipoprotein B gene. The cause of the hypobetalipoproteinaemia in these subjects remains uncharacterised although future linkage analysis studies in these individuals and family members will at least establish whether their hypobetalipoproteinaemia is related to the apo B gene.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apolipoprotein B</field><field name="subject">lipoprotein cholesterol</field><field name="subject">hypobetalipoproteinaemia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270800 Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soils and geomorphology of a lowland rimu forest managed for sustainable timber production</field><field name="creator">Almond, Peter C.</field><field name="description">Saltwater Forest is a Dacrydium cupressinum-dominated lowland forest covering 9000 ha in south Westland, South Island, New Zealand. Four thousand hectares is managed for sustainable production of indigenous timber. The aim of this study was to provide an integrated analysis of soils, soil-landform relationships, and soil-vegetation relationships at broad and detailed scales. The broad scale understandings provide a framework in which existing or future studies can be placed and the detailed studies elucidate sources of soil and forest variability.  Glacial landforms dominate. They include late Pleistocene lateral, terminal and ablation moraines, and outwash aggradation and degradation terraces. Deposits and landforms from six glacial advances have been recognised ranging from latest Last (Otira) Glaciation to Penultimate (Waimea) Glaciation. The absolute ages of landforms were established by analysis of the thickness and soil stratigraphy of loess coverbeds, augmented with radiocarbon dating and phytolith and pollen analysis.  In the prevailing high rainfall of Westland soil formation is rapid. The rate of loess accretion in Saltwater Forest (ca. 30 mm ka&#8315;&#185;) has been low enough that soil formation and loess accretion took place contemporaneously. Soils formed in this manner are known as upbuilding soils. The significant difference between upbuilding pedogenesis and pedogenesis in a topdown sense into an existing sediment body is that each subsoil increment of an upbuilding soil has experienced processes of all horizons above. In Saltwater Forest subsoils of upbuilding soils are strongly altered because they have experienced the extremely acid environment of the soil surface at some earlier time. Some soil chronosequence studies in Westland have included upbuilding soils formed in loess as the older members of the sequence. Rates and types of processes inferred from these soils should be reviewed because upbuilding is a different pedogenic pathway to topdown pedogenesis.  Landform age and morphology were used as a primary stratification for a study of the soil pattern and nature of soil variability in the 4000 ha production area of Saltwater Forest. The age of landforms (&gt; 14 ka) and rapid soil formation mean that soils are uniformly strongly weathered and leached. Soils include Humic Organic Soils, Perch-gley Podzols, Acid Gley Soils, Allophanic Brown Soils, and Orthic or Pan Podzols. The major influence on the nature of soils is site hydrology which is determined by macroscale features of landforms (slope, relief, drainage density), mesoscale effects related to position on landforms, and microscale influences determined by microtopography and individual tree effects. Much of the soil variability arises at microscales so that it is not possible to map areas of uniform soils at practical map scales. The distribution of soil variability across spatial scales, in relation to the intensity of forest management, dictates that it is most appropriate to map soil complexes with boundaries coinciding with landforms.  Disturbance of canopy trees is an important agent in forest dynamics. The frequency of forest disturbance in the production area of Saltwater Forest varies in a systematic way among landforms in accord with changes in abundance of different soils. The frequency of forest turnover is highest on landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained Organic Soils. As the abundance of better-drained soils increases the frequency of forest turnover declines. Changes in turnover frequency are reflected in the mean size and density of canopy trees (Dacrydium cupressinum) among landforms. Terrace and ablation moraine landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained soils have on average the smallest trees growing most densely. The steep lateral moraines, characterised by well drained soils, have fewer, larger trees. The changes manifested at the landform scale are an integration of processes operating over much shorter range as a result of short-range soil variability. The systematic changes in forest structure and turnover frequency among landforms and soils have important implications for sustainable forest management.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glacial stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">loess accumulation</field><field name="subject">soil stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">Aokautere Ash</field><field name="subject">oxygen isotope record</field><field name="subject">phytoliths</field><field name="subject">thermoluminescence dating</field><field name="subject">pedogenesis</field><field name="subject">soil chronosequences</field><field name="subject">soil variability</field><field name="subject">soil survey</field><field name="subject">soil-landform models</field><field name="subject">forest soils</field><field name="subject">forest disturbance</field><field name="subject">disturbance frequency</field><field name="subject">soil-vegetation relationships</field><field name="subject">windthrow</field><field name="subject">earthquakes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300606 Agroforestry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions</field><field name="creator">Russell, Benjamin Gallard, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Odour plays an important role in many predator/prey interactions. In the northern hemisphere, many mammalian prey species have been shown to respond to predator odours. It is also widely assumed that mammalian predators utilise odours to locate their prey. This thesis explores the importance of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions. Responses of native Australian species to the faecal odour of two predators; the native tiger quoll Dasyurus maculatus and the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes, were evaluated through live-trapping and focussed behavioural studies of captive animals. Tiger quoll responses to prey olfactory cues were investigated in a captive experiment. Native rodents (bush rats Rattus fuscipes, swamp rats R. lutreolus and eastern chestnut mice Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) equally avoided traps scented with either quoll or fox faeces, and in captive experiments, bush rats and swamp rats reduced their average speed in response to both predator odours. Of the marsupial species, northern brown bandicoots Isoodon macrourus and common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula were captured more frequently in quoll-scented traps than unscented traps or foxscented traps, while captures of brown antechinus Antechinus stuarttii, long-nosed bandicoots Perameles nasuta and southern brown bandicoot I. obesulus were unaffected by the either predator odour. In captive experiments, brown antechinus, long-nosed and northern brown bandicoots decreased their foraging in response to both predator odours, and spent less time in areas scented with quoll faeces. Tiger quolls didn't appear to detect odour sources from a distance of &gt;65 cm, but they did follow scent trails and spent more time in areas scented with the urine and faeces of potential prey. Chemical analysis revealed no common components in fox and quoll odour which prey species could be responding to. Therefore, these native species have evolved to respond to fox odour since foxes were introduced to Australia 130 years ago. The stronger response of native rodents to fox odour may be a legacy of their co-evolution with canid predators prior to entering Australia. A better understanding of how odour is utilised in Australian predator/prey interactions may lead to a greater ability to protect Australia's unique mammalian fauna from introduced predators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Predatory animals - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Spotted-tailed quoll - Ecology - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Red fox - Ecology - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Rodents - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Brown antechinus - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Bandicoots - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Smell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular changes in the topoisomerase genes, gyrA and parC, and their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance in the pathogenic Neisseria.</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Tiffany Rose, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined molecular changes in the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the topoisomerase genes, gyrA and parC of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis and their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR). Initially models of FQR emergence were developed from analysis of resistant mutants generated in vitro. The effects of the nature and order of sequential changes in GyrA and ParC on FQR were explored by correlating QRDR changes with ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations. The in vitro models were validated by comparisons of QRDR changes and MICs in two populations of wild-type FQR N. gonorrhoeae over a wide MIC range (0.09 to 24??g/mL), and in a wild type FQR meningococcus. The in vitro activities of three newer quinolones with differential activity on GyrA and ParC were compared with that of ciprofloxacin. Key findings were that the initial QRDR changes always occurred in gyrA and were the predominant influence on phenotypic expression of FQR. QRDR alterations were acquired sequentially and two GyrA and two ParC changes represented the full complement of changes observed in gonococci and two GyrA and one ParC change those in meningococci. GyrA alterations at Ser-91 in gonococci and Thr???91 in meningococci were pivotal for the development of further resistance. ParC changes required the presence of two GyrA alterations for any major impact on FQR. ParC substitutions, Ser-87???Arg and Glu-91???Gly in gonococci and Cys- 85???Asp and Glu-91???Lys in meningococci led to the expression of the highest FQR levels. Examination of FQR in wild-type meningococci was necessarily restricted, but analyses using the broader MIC range available in in-vitro-derived FQR meningococci (0.09 to 16??g/mL) revealed the first ParC changes in N. meningitidis. The study also redefined QRDR boundaries and described novel mutations within them. The nature of sequence changes in GyrA and ParC in FQR Neisseria also affected the relative activities of the three newer quinolones. Trovafloxacin was the most active quinolone in vitro but MIC differences with ciprofloxacin were mutation-dependent. Grepafloxacin and moxifloxacin were only slightly more active than ciprofloxacin in the presence of multiple QRDR changes. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between QRDR alterations and FQR in N. gonorrhoeae and offers insights into the potential for FQR development in N. meningitidis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quinolone antibacterical agents -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</field><field name="subject">Neisseria meningitidis</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance in microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long term housing prices in Australia and some economic perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stapledon, Nigel David, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs, principally from primary sources, a long term time series for house and land prices for Sydney and Melbourne, and house price and rental yield series for Australia. These new series span the period 1880-1965 and give an historical perspective beyond the period from 1970 for which existing house price time series begin for Australia and for most of the world. The price series indicates that the modern experience (i.e. since the 1970s) of a significant upward trend in real prices differs markedly from the experience in the first half of the 20th century when house prices moved very little. The thesis then takes several approaches to explaining the apparent shift in direction in the mid 20th century. The first approach examines house prices in terms of demand and supply variables. Urban theory says that demographic and income factors are critical. However, assessed over this long time span, these demand factors do not offer a satisfactory explanation. Additionally, it is found that there is no cointegrating relationship between prices and income. Rather, it appears that supply factors have probably been the pivotal influence in explaining the shift in direction, consistent with a growing literature which focuses on the role of regulation and other constraints on supply. In Australia???s case, government policies imposing capital contributions on the cost of land appear to be a major factor. The second approach taken is to view housing in terms of asset pricing as more typically applied to the equity market by Campbell and Shiller (1988) and others. A central debate is whether or not there has been a structural fall in the equity yield and given the parallel fall in the house yield, this question is posed for housing. The thesis finds that tax and other factors can explain a structural decline in the housing yield. The house rental yield appears to be a better predictor of future rental growth and a negative predictor of future returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss minimization in the modified algorithm of load flow analysis in industrial power system</field><field name="creator">Lukman, Dedek, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research looks at an alternative technique of loss minimization using B-loss formula in solving load flow analysis. A modeling of electrical system elements is first developed. A literature review on the history and development of load flow analysis and loss minimization especially on the use of B-loss formula are delivered. A report on load flow in practice and loss minimization measures based on a utility visit to EnergyAustralia is given. An analysis on three types of industrial power systems is also discussed. A substantial study on EDSA was made to adapt the commercial load flow program and demonstrate voltage control methods to achieve loss minimization. The research thesis work focuses on the use of a load flow analysis program to calculate and minimize losses in large electrical power distribution system such as an industrial power system. A Matlab load flow analysis program has been developed successfully using modified polar Newton-Raphson algorithms based on bus admittance matrix Ybus and the use of B-loss coefficient method. Real power losses are calculated using Blosses coefficients for achieving loss minimization and the technique has been verified with the traditional I2R and/or differential power methods. Modified load flow algorithm is also implemented by applying voltage control methods using either a shunt capacitor or a load tap changing (LTC) transformer. Voltage level is improved whilst minimizing losses. Appropriate modeling of a capacitor and an LTC transformer have been developed proven. A network of a typical meshed secondary selective system of five bus has been chosen and used as the test case. Several case studies with different values of capacitance and tap settings of transformer have been conducted to determine minimum losses. Further sensitivity analysis is carried out by simulating a wide range of load power configurations and line and transformer resistances to verify the robustness of the proposed modified algorithms especially on the use of B-losses algorithm for the chosen network. Results showed that the proposed algorithms ,although less accurate than full I2R calculations, are robust and reliable to achieve loss minimization for various ranges of load and impedance configurations. There is confidence in applying the method to larger systems. This two-year thesis details novel contribution towards loss minimization in power systems by applying B-losses formula into a load flow program, expressing the system losses in terms of active power generations which allows coordination of transmission losses in scheduling output of each generating plant. This gives maximum economy for a given load and achieves loss minimization using voltage control methods. This technique is not possible using standard commercial load flow programs.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punishment and imprisonment in New South Wales: towards a conceptual analysis of purpose</field><field name="creator">Sotiri, Melinda, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research conducts a conceptual and qualitative investigation into the practices, rationales and functions of imprisonment in NSW. A specific system of imprisonment, in this case the prisons operated by the NSW Department of Corrective services, is explored in order to examine the practices, processes and justifications for incarceration. The various purposes, theories, rhetorics, practices and contradictions of the prison system in NSW and the ways in which the people who are responsible for the administration of this system make sense of its operations and its incoherencies, are central to this analysis.  This research utilises a hybrid methodology involving aspects of content analysis and grounded theory. At the centre of this research are eight interviews with senior NSW Corrective Services staff. This analysis is supplemented by interview with ex-prisoners, and other people familiar with, but not working for Corrective Services. In addition a documentary analysis of both Corrective Services documents, and external literature examining NSW prison is carried out.  The findings of these analyses are then explored with reference to both their internal coherency, as well as their relationship to a range of theoretical frameworks. The thesis connects abstract and philosophical questions of punishment and penalty with the logistics of running the prison system in NSW. This research found a diversity of practices, understandings and justifications of imprisonment which connected to particular cultural, social philosophical and structural trends. These included victimary discourses, the rhetoric of progress, the influence of managerialism, the faith in ???objective??? professionals, the increasing emphasis on empiricism, the conflicts between coercive practices and individual responsibility, the construction of prisoners as dangerous, and an ongoing struggle for purpose. Imprisonment in NSW was found to be characterised by discrepancies between the intentions of its administrators and pragmatics of its practice, conflicts between internal explanations of its purpose, as well as contradictions between internal Corrective Services accounts and external expectations about the roles, functions and practices of imprisonment. Theoretical perspectives explaining why these characterise imprisonment in NSW were developed. These perspective include the ???ought/is??? confusion of penal administrators, the inhumanity of humane containment, the myth of technocratic amorality, and the sedimentation of purpose.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Punishment -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Imprisonment -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scanline calculation of radial influence for image processing</field><field name="creator">Ilbery, Peter William Mitchell, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Efficient methods for the calculation of radial influence are described and applied to two image processing problems, digital halftoning and mixed content image compression. The methods operate recursively on scanlines of image values, spreading intensity from scanline to scanline in  proportions approximating a Cauchy distribution.  For error diffusion halftoning, experiments show that this recursive scanline spreading provides an ideal pattern of distribution of error. Error diffusion using masks generated to provide this distribution of error alleviate error diffusion "worm" artifacts.  The recursive scanline by scanline application of a spreading filter and a complementary filter can be used to reconstruct an image from its horizontal and vertical pixel difference values. When combined with the use of a downsampled image the reconstruction is robust to incomplete and quantized pixel difference data. Such gradient field integration methods are described in detail proceeding from representation of images by gradient values along contours through to a variety of efficient algorithms.  Comparisons show that this form of gradient field integration by convolution provides reduced distortion compared to other high speed gradient integration methods. The reduced distortion can be attributed to success in approximating a radial pattern of influence. An approach to edge-based image compression is proposed using integration of gradient data along edge contours and regularly sampled low resolution image data. This edge-based image compression model is similar to previous sketch based image coding methods but allows a simple and efficient calculation of an edge-based approximation image.  A low complexity implementation of this approach to compression is described. The implementation extracts and represents gradient data along edge contours as pixel differences and calculates an approximate image by performing integration of pixel difference data by scanline convolution. The implementation was developed as a prototype for compression of mixed content image data in printing systems. Compression results are reported and strengths and weaknesses of the implementation are identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">halftoning</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">image representation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pragmatic approach to area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Nadeem, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Success of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) largely depends on whether the deployed network can provide desired area coverage with acceptable network lifetime. In hostile or harsh environments such as enemy territories in battlefields, fire or chemical spills, it is impossible to deploy the sensor nodes in a predeter- mined regular topology to guarantee adequate coverage. Random deployment is thus more practical and feasible for large target areas. On the other hand, random deployment of sensors is highly susceptible to the occurrence of coverage holes in the target area. A potential solution for enhancing the existing coverage achieved by random deployments involves the use of mobility capable sensors that would help fill the coverage holes. This thesis seeks to address the problem of determining the current coverage achieved by the non-deterministic deployment of static sensor nodes and subsequently enhancing the coverage using mobile sensors.  The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of MAPC (Mobility Assisted Probabilistic Coverage), a distributed protocol for ensuring area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks. The primary contribution is a pragmatic approach to sensor coverage and maintenance that we hope would lower the technical barriers to its field deployment. Most of the assumptions made in the MAPC protocol are realistic and implementable in real-life applications e.g., practical boundary estimation, coverage calculations based on a realistic sensing model, and use of movement triggering thresholds based on real radio characteristics etc. The MAPC is a comprehensive three phase protocol. In the first phase, the static sensors calculate the area coverage using the Probabilistic Coverage Algorithm (PCA). This is a deviation from the idealistic assumption used in the binary detection model, wherein a sensor can sense accurately within a well defined (usually circular) region. Static sensors execute the PCA algorithm, in a distributed way, to identify any holes in the coverage. In the second phase, MAPC scheme moves the mobile nodes in an optimal manner to fill these uncovered locations. For different types of initial deployments, the proposed movement algorithms consume only 30-40% of the energy consumed by the basic virtual force algorithm. In addition, this thesis addresses the problem of coverage loss due to damaged and energy depleted nodes. The problem has been formulated as an Integer Linear Program and implementable heuristics are developed that perform close to optimal solutions. By replacing in-operational nodes in phase three, MAPC scheme ensures the continuous operation of the WSN.  Experiments with real mote hardware were conducted to validate the boundary and coverage estimation part of the MAPC protocol. Extensive discrete event simulations (using NS2) were also performed for the complete MAPC protocol and the results demonstrate that MAPC can enhance and maintain the area coverage by efficiently moving mobile sensor nodes to strategic positions in the uncovered area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coverage Issues.</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of ocean tides</field><field name="creator">Das, Pritha, School of Methematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis three independent studies of tidal dynamics have been pesented. The  first is an analytical study of continental shelf tides forced at the ocean boundary. Earlier studies have shown that the response for a sloping shelf and a flat shelf differ and that the response for a flat shelf changes when tides are incident at an angle. Other studies considered a sloping shelf but they did not take into account a possible non-zero depth at a coastal wall. This study shows that the effects of a sloping shelf, a coastal wall and obliquely incident tides an all significantly modify the response on the shelf. The modification increases with the width of the shelf, and in a wide shelf scenario, near resonance, it greatly modifies the response. Secondly, the Princeton Ocean Model in barotropic mode along with a tracer transport module has been used to study the tides of Sydney Harbour. The tidally induced residual circulation due to the semi-diurnal tide consists of a series of recirculating gyres which are due to the interaction of flow with topography. This study shows that in the harbour it is the Lagrangian residual velocity not the Eulerian residual velocity which determines the net transport  of material over a tidal cycle. In addition, the flushing time of the harbour varies significantly in space, and the tidal mixing is restricted in the vicinity of the entrance. The third is a theoretical study of forced oscillations in a rotating, flat-bottomed, circular basin. This study shows that the direction of propagation of waves in a basin depends on the ratio of its radius to depth. At each latitude there is a critical value of this ratio and this value decreases with increase in latitude. Beyond this value, waves start to propagate around the basin in the opposite direction to the earth ???s rotation (clockwise in the northern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere).The presence of friction increases this critical value which shows that friction plays an important role in determining the response.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tides</field><field name="subject">mathemetical models</field><field name="subject">oceans</field><field name="subject">dynamics</field><field name="subject">continental shelf</field><field name="subject">Sydney Habour</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BAFF regulation of peripheral T cell responses</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Andrew Peter Robert, St Vincents Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The activation and effector function of CD4+ T cells are critical points of regulation during an antigen specific T cell response. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to the development of human diseases, encompassing both immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. Members of the TNF superfamily have recently emerged as important regulators of T cell responses, with their overexpression causing autoimmune inflammation in animal models. As overproduction of the novel TNF superfamily ligand BAFF is associated with several autoimmune conditions, we sought to examine the potential role of BAFF as a regulator of T cell activation and effector function. We initially demonstrated BAFF costimulation of T cell activation in vitro. Generation of specific monoclonal antibodies identified BAFF-R as the only BAFF receptor present on T cells, and showed that it was expressed in an activation-dependent and subset-specific manner. Impaired BAFF costimulation in BAFF-R deficient mice indicated that BAFF-R was crucial for mediating BAFF effects in T cells. Analysis of T cell responses in vivo revealed that BAFF transgenic mice have increased T cell priming and recall responses to protein antigens, and showed a corresponding increase in the DTH model of Th1 cell-dependent inflammation. In addition, Th2-dependent allergic airway responses are suppressed in BAFF transgenic mice. Crossing to a B cell deficient background revealed that the proinflammatory effects of BAFF on T cell priming and DTH rely on the presence of B cells, while the suppressive effects during allergic airway inflammation are B cell independent. These data demonstrated that BAFF regulated the outcome of T cell responses in vivo and identified BAFF dependent crosstalk between T and B cells. Stimulation of B cells with BAFF induced the upregulation of MHC class II and ICOS-L both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of these cell surface molecules was associated with an increased capacity to induce T cell proliferation, however this effect was independent of ICOS-L expression. Thus it was demonstrated that BAFF regulated T cell activation and effector function both directly, via stimulation of BAFF-R, and indirectly, by altering the function of B cells. These data suggest that BAFF dependent alterations in T cell function may be an additional causative factor in the association between elevated BAFF levels and the generation of autoimmunity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Propagation of high frequency partial discharge signal in power cables</field><field name="creator">O, Hio Nam Johnson , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulation lifetime of power cables is determined by several factors. One of the most important of these is the occurrence of partial discharge (PD) at the dielectric. The ability to detect and locate a PD source is limited by attenuation of the high frequency PD pulses as they propagate through the cable to the sensor. Therefore it is necessary to understand the high frequency response of such cables. The ultimate aim of this thesis is to develop an accurate frequency-dependent cable model for detecting and locating degraded insulation regions on power cables, caused by partial discharge activities.  Numerical methods can calculate field distribution in the vicinity of a cavity of non-standard shape which generates PDs, and is difficult to calculate by analytical methods. The simulated results show the important influence of the shape of cavity on the electric stress within it. The cavity stress enhancement increases as the permittivity of the dielectric increases. The increase is greater for cavities with large diameter to thickness ratios. A cavity with its axis parallel to the applied field direction has a higher stress enhancement. In addition the stress distribution in the cavity is smaller for spherical cavities than for cylindrical types. The research results show that the semi-conducting layers response voltage increases as frequency increases. This indicates that the semi-conducting layers can have high sensitivity for detection of partial discharge signals and this may be a useful feature to incorporate in the design of cables and in the application of cable models. By using ATPDraw, FEM and EMTP-RV techniques, three different types of cable models are developed. The simulated results give a good agreement with the measured results on the single and three phase power cable. The developed cable model can use for reconstruction of PD source signal by using the receiving signal captured at the cable ends. It is important to use the true pulse shape because it is characteristic of the PD type and location.  An investigation into the possibility of detecting different PD patterns and signals when conducting PD tests using different sensor bandwidths is also presented in this thesis. The occurrence of discharge activity was created by an artificial defect manufactured in the single core cable insulation. The artificial defect generated internal discharge and was used to investigate the PD signal propagation on cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable. Capacitance coupled  external sensors have been applied for the PD detection measurements and the results  show that these external sensors have  a  number of advantages compared to  high frequency current transformer (HF-CT) sensors  for the detection of PD pulses.  In addition, development of a method to detect cross-coupling of PD signals between  phases of a three core cable and location of the PD source on the three phase cable.  In order to visualize recorded data gained by PD measurement of three phase cable under test, the 3PARD diagram was used. Each data pulse is assigned to a single dot in the (scatter plot) diagram. The measured results show that the 3PARD diagram allowed the user to identify the fault between phases with PD location.  The model used for reconstruction which includes the effect of semicon material in the losses provides accurate reproduction of the propagation characteristics of high frequency PD pulses and the thesis work had used such a model to reconstruct PD waveforms of site PDs from the measured signal for the first time. The use of the original waveform is important for PD identification and location in the practical situation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EMTP</field><field name="subject">Partial Discharge</field><field name="subject">Power Cable</field><field name="subject">Propagation</field><field name="subject">High Frequency Signal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indexing and partitioning schemes for distributed tensor computing with application to multiple sequence alignment</field><field name="creator">Helal, Manal , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates indexing and partitioning schemes for high dimensional scientific computational problems. Building on the foundation offered by Mathematics of Arrays (MoA) for tensor-based computation, the ultimate contribution of the thesis is a unified partitioning scheme that works invariant of the dataset dimension and shape. Consequently, portability is ensured between different high performance machines, cluster architectures, and potentially computational grids. The Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem in computational biology has an optimal dynamic programming based solution, but it becomes computationally infeasible as its dimensionality (the number of sequences) increases. Even sub-optimal approximations may be unmanageable for more than eight sequences. Furthermore, no existing MSA algorithms have been formulated in a manner invariant over the number of sequences. This thesis presents an optimal distributed MSA method based on MoA. The latter offers a set of constructs that help represent multidimensional arrays in memory in a linear, concise and efficient way. Using MoA allows the partitioning of the dynamic programming algorithm to be expressed independently of dimension. MSA is the highest dimensional scientific problem considered for MoA-based partitioning to date. Two partitioning schemes are presented: the first is a master/slave approach which is based on both master/slave scheduling and slave/slave coupling. The second approach is a peer-to-peer design, in which the scheduling and dependency communication are calculated independently by each process, with no need for a master scheduler. A search space reduction technique is introduced to cater for the exponential expansion as the problem dimensionality increases. This technique relies on defining a hyper-diagonal through the tensor space, and choosing a band of neighbouring partitions around the diagonal to score. In contrast, other sub-optimal methods in the literature only consider projections on the surface of the hyper-cube. The resulting massively parallel design produces a scalable solution that has been implemented on high performance machines and cluster architectures. Experimental results for these implementations are presented for both simulated and real datasets. Comparisons between the reduced search space technique of this thesis with other sub-optimal methods for the MSA problem are presented.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Partitioning</field><field name="subject">Tensor Computing</field><field name="subject">High Performance Computing</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Programming</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Parallel Processing</field><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers Mentored by Students in Using ICT</field><field name="creator">Gronn, Donna</field><field name="description">Despite considerable expenditure by school systems on ICT in terms of hardware, software, and related professional development programs, the impact on classroom practice remains disappointing to many. Current models of teacher professional learning in ICT appear to have had minimal impact. Based in the interpretative paradigm, this thesis describes the experience of the participants in a unique professional development program in which students in Grades 3 and 4 mentored teachers in their school in the use of ICT. The study was undertaken in two schools in Melbourne, Australia, and involved the professional development of teachers in the use of digital cameras and related software. Following their initial training with the researcher in one school and a focus teacher in another, the children worked in pairs to conduct three semi-structured sessions with a teacher, mentoring them in the use of the technology. The children were also available to the teachers for further consultation or assistance. It was intended that the mentoring program would enhance teachers&#8217; knowledge of the technology and also their classroom practice. This thesis reports the benefits of student mentors in ICT as seen by teacher mentees involved in the project. In particular, the focus of this study is on the teachers&#8217; perceived effect of the student mentoring approach to professional development in relation to their skills and confidence with ICT, their classroom practice with ICT and their recognition of other values inherent in the program. Data were collected throughout the project in the form of surveys, interviews, observations and student and teacher journals. Using NVivo, these data were analysed into themes to ascertain teachers&#8217; reported benefits of the program in relation to their skills, confidence and classroom practice with ICT. Findings of the project included the improvement in teachers&#8217; skills and confidence and an impact on their thinking and practices with technology in the classroom. As well as these intended outcomes, teachers also reported a greater knowledge of their personal learning preferences, which influenced the way they saw the children&#8217;s learning and therefore their classroom practice. Child mentors flourished in the mentoring relationships, showing their prowess in mentoring teachers with ICT, with several surprising their teachers with their capabilities. Overall, the teachers were very positive about the mentoring experience and the influence it had on their confidence, skills and classroom practice. This study showed the potential impact of children as mentors of teachers in ICT, and offers a model for consideration by schools and school systems in the way in which they approach professional learning in ICT of their teachers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary school teachers</field><field name="subject">Mentors</field><field name="subject">Primary school students</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp230.30042010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Critical Edition of Anastasius Bibliothecarius' Latin Translation of Greek Documents Pertaining to the Life of Maximus the Confessor, with an Analysis of Anastasius' Translation Methodology, and an English Translation of the Latin Text</field><field name="creator">Neil, Bronwen</field><field name="description">Part I Anastasius Bibliothecarius, papal librarian, translator and diplomat, is one of the pivotal figures of the ninth century in both literary and political contexts. His contribution to relations between the eastern and western church can be considered to have had both positive and negative ramifications, and it will be argued that his translations of various Greek works into Latin played a significant role in achieving his political agenda, complex and convoluted as this was. Being one of relatively few Roman bilinguals in the latter part of the ninth century, Anastasius found that his linguistic skills opened an avenue into papal affairs that was not closed by even the greatest breaches of trust and violations of canonical law on his part. His chequered career spanning five pontificates will be reviewed in the first chapter. In Chapter 2, we discuss his corpus of works of translation, in particular the Collectanea, whose sole surviving witness, the Parisinus Latinus 5095, has been partially edited in this study. This collation and translation of seven documents pertaining to the life of Maximus the Confessor provides us with a unique insight into Anastasius' capacity as a translator, and into the political and cultural significance of the commissioning and dedication of his hagiographic and other translated works in general. These seven documents will be examined in detail in Chapter 3, and compared with the Greek tradition, where that has survived, in an effort to establish the codes governing translation in this period, and to establish which manuscripts of the Greek tradition correspond most closely to Anastasius' (lost) model. In Chapter 4, we analyse consistency of style and method by comparison with Anastasius' translation of the Historia Mystica attributed to Germanus of Constantinople. Anastasius' methodology will be compared and contrasted with that of his contemporary John Scotus Eriugena, to place his oeuvre in the broader context of bilingualism in the West in the ninth century.

As such, the scope of an investigation should be dependent on the conditions at the site and the importance of the structure. However, it is common for the expense dedicated to the site investigation to be a fraction of the total cost of the project, and is typically determined by budget and time constraints, and the experience and judgement of the geotechnical engineer. However, additional site investigation expenditure or sampling is expected to reduce the financial risk of the design by reducing the uncertainties in the geotechnical system and protecting against possible foundation failures. This research has quantified the relative benefits of undertaking site investigations of increased and differing scope. This has been achieved by simulating the design process to yield a foundation design based on the results of a site investigation. Such a design has been compared to an optimal design that utilises the complete knowledge of the soil, which has only been possible due to the use of simulated soils. Comparisons between these two design types indicate the performance of the site investigation to accurately or adequately characterise the site conditions. Furthermore, the design based on the results of the site investigation have been analysed using the complete knowledge of the soil. This yields a probability of failure and, therefore, has been included in a risk analysis where the costs associated with the site investigation have been measured against the financial risk of the design. As such, potential savings in financial risk for increased site investigation expenditure have been subsequently identified. A Monte Carlo analysis has been used in this research to incorporate the uncertainties in the foundation design process. Uncertainties have been included due to soil variability; sampling errors; measurement and transformation model errors; and errors related to the use of a simplified foundation response prediction method. The Monte Carlo analysis has also provided the means to obtain results in a probabilistic framework to enable reliability and risk analyses. Computer code has been specifically developed with an aim to: generate a simulated soil that conforms to the variability of soil properties; simulate a site investigation to estimate data for a foundation design; simulate the design of a foundation and conduct a reliability and risk analysis of such a design. Results indicate that there are significant benefits to be derived from increasing the scope of a site investigation in terms of the risk and reliability of the foundation design. However, it also appears that an optimal site investigation scope or expenditure exists where additional expenditure leads to a design with a higher financial risk due to the increased cost of the site investigation. The expected savings in terms of financial risk are significant when compared to the increased investigation cost. These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a site investigation in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">earth sciences; geology; geoscience, civil engineers</field><field name="subject">Engineering geology Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Soil dynamics Testing.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stability of multiple wing-tip vortices.</field><field name="creator">Whitehead, Edward J.</field><field name="description">Over the last forty or so years interest in the study of wing-tip vortices has increased, primarily due to the introduction of larger passenger aircraft and their subsequent interaction with smaller aircraft. The vortices generated by these larger aircraft present a problem in two main areas; the wake hazard problem, where other aircraft can be subjected to the large tangential velocities of the vortex, and the interaction with ground based features of vortices created during landing and take-off. The first of these is particularly dangerous close to the ground when aircraft are in a high lift configuration at take-off and landing. As the vortices effectively scale with aircraft wing span, significant encounters between large vortices and smaller aircraft have been documented over the years. An example of one such documented wake vortex interaction incident can be found in Ogawa. In this study, the system of vortices are described as classical Batchelor vortices (or linear superpositions thereof) which are then subjected to small perturbations. By discretising the domain and solving for the eigenvalues of the system it is possible to ascertain the stability characteristics of the flow as a function of the system parameters which include the axial wave-number, the spacing of the vortices, their cross-flow decay rate and their axial strength. We first consider the inviscid instability of multiple tip vortices, an approximation which is valid in the limit of large Reynolds numbers. In this limit the stability of the flow is dominated by the axial component of the basic vortex flow. The governing equations of continuity and momentum are reduced to a second order partial differential equation (PDE). This equation is solved numerically to determine which vortex configurations produce the greatest instability growth rate. These results are extended to consider the effect of compressibility on the inviscid instability. Finally we consider the effects of viscosity on the stability of the full Batchelor similarity solution which results in a second order PDE in four dependent variables. The stability equations are solved both globally (for the entire eigenspectra) and locally (for a single eigenvalue in a pre-determined region) using codes that run in both serial and parallel form. The numerical methods are based on pseudospectral discretisation (Chebyshev polynomials for Cartesian and radial directions and Fourier for azimuthal) in the global scheme, the eigenvalues being recovered either with a QZ algorithm or a shift-and-invert Arnoldi algorithm. For the local scheme, fourth order centred finite-diffences are used in conjunction with an iterative eigenvalue recovery method.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stability; vortices; batchelor vortex, inviscid stability; viscous stability; wing-tip vortex</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on the sorption affinity of soil organic matter for non-ionic organic pollutants.</field><field name="creator">Ahangar, Ahmad G.</field><field name="description">Sorption of non-ionic organic compounds to organic matter is usually characterized as a partitioning interaction, which is quantified by K [subscript]oc, the organic-C normalized partitioning coefficient. However K [subscript]oc for any single compound varies considerably between soils, often by a factor of 3-10. This study addresses some of the potential causes of this variability. Forty-four soil cores were collected from a 2 ha paddock. Ten of these cores were selected for sorption measurements. The chemical composition of the soil organic matter (SOM) was determined using &#185;&#179;C NMR analysis. It was found that K [subscript]oc for diuron was positively correlated with aryl C (r&#178; = 0.59) and negatively correlated with O-alkyl C (r&#178; = 0.84). There were no such correlations for phenanthrene K [subscript]oc. A second set of experiments was carried out to investigate the effects of SOM&#8211; mineral interactions on the sorption properties of a selection of the soils. It was found that HF-treatment increased K [subscript]oc for both phenanthrene and diuron. The HF treatment removes mineral matter leaving the organic phase unaffected by the treatment. The increase in K [subscript]oc on HF-treatment soils provides strong evidence that interactions between organic matter and soil minerals block organic matter sorption sites. Furthermore, following HF-treatment, there was a positive correlation between K [subscript]oc for phenanthrene and aryl C and carbonyl C and a negative correlation with O-alkyl C. This suggests that the non-constancy of the relationship between organic matter chemistry and K [subscript]oc, for whole soils in the case of phenanthrene, may be a consequence of variability of the effect of organic matter-mineral interactions on K [subscript]oc. The influence of lipids on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene to soils was also investigated. Lipids are known to cover the surfaces of organic matter in soil. K [subscript]oc for diuron and phenanthrene were consistently higher for the lipid-extracted soils than for the whole soils (average of 31% for diuron and 29% for phenanthrene), indicating that lipids block sorption sites on the organic matter. Sorption experiments on one pair of HF-treated soils indicated that the blocking effects of minerals and lipids are independent, because lipid extraction and HF-treatment combined increased K [subscript]oc by more than either treatment alone. In the last experiment, the effect of solvent conditioning on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene was investigated. The K [subscript]oc values for compounds were consistently higher for solvent-treated whole soil and lipid-extracted soil than corresponding soils before solvent treatment. Solid-state &#185;&#179;C NMR spectra of the solvent-treated soils indicated that there were no significant changes in the chemical structure of SOM caused by solvent treatment. Solvent treatment changes the physical conformation of the SOM, increasing its sorption affinity. The key findings from the research are: &#8226;	Variations in sorption affinity for diuron are related to differences in the soil organic matter chemistry. &#8226;	SOM-mineral interactions can have a substantial influence on K [subscript]oc for non- ionic compounds. &#8226;	Lipids may block the active sorption sites on the SOM thereby diminishing sorption overall. &#8226;	Solvent conditioning can change the physical conformation of SOM and lead to enhancement sorption of diuron and phenanthrene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorption; Non-ionic organic pollutant; Soil sorption affinity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Termitaria as regolith landscape attributes and sampling media in northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">Petts, Anna E.</field><field name="description">This study provides one of the first accounts of the relationships between termites, termitaria and the pedolith, towards developing their application as a biogeochemical sampling medium for mineral exploration. Mapping regolith&#8211;landforms, termitaria, and the associated termitaria biogeochemistry show that termites are an integral control on the organisation of trace metals in the landscapes of northern Australia. In particular, termites are important for transporting geochemical signatures from depth, through the pedolith and to the ground surface. This occurs by way of bioturbative and constructional activities of the mound-building termites, which in this study included Nasutitermes triodiae, Amitermes vitiosus, Drepanotermes rubriceps, Tumulitermes hastilis and T. pastinator. Termitaria from these species are mappable regolith&#8211; landform attributes at the local scale; this highlights their specific preferences for colony sites, such as access to vegetation, drainage, and the availability of construction materials. The mound-building termites featured in this study are also soil modifiers, altering the pedolith terms of both structure and chemistry. Developing an understanding of these processes has helped to refine a model for pedolith development through biotic processes, which is applicable to subtropical and tropical climatic regions, where termites act as important ecosystem engineers. This research project fills a niche for new scientific investigation of deeper regolith profiles and associated terrains; it moves away from theories of shallow soil development overlying an abiotic deep regolith, towards understanding pedolith development as wholly biotically driven. For mineral explorers this means that ore-related elements, such as Au, As and Zn, are re-organised and moved towards the land surface in settings such as buried Au-deposits and mineralisation in the Tanami region, and Pine Creek Orogen. A key finding within the study of the application of this technique is that the fine, silt-clay (&gt;79 &#956;m) from termitaria is capable of accurately delineating the surficial expression of buried Au mineralisation. Termitaria can therefore provide an accessible surficial biogeochemical sampling media that can be used in mineral exploration programs</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Termites; Mineral exploration; Regolith science; Regolith landform mapping; Tanami; Northern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infrared spectroscopy and advanced spectral data analyses to better describe sorption of pesticides in soils.</field><field name="creator">Forouzangohar, Mohsen</field><field name="description">The fate and behaviour of hydrophobic organic compounds (e.g. pesticides) in soils are largely controlled by sorption processes. Recent findings suggest that the chemical properties of soil organic carbon (OC) significantly control the extent of sorption of such compounds in soil systems. However, currently there is no practical tool to integrate the effects of OC chemistry into sorption predictions. Therefore, the K [subscript]oc model, which relies on the soil OC content (foc), is used for predicting soil sorption coefficients (K[subscript]d) of pesticides. The K[subscript]oc model can be expressed as K[subscript]d = K[subscript]oc &#215; foc, where K[subscript]oc is the OC-normalized sorption coefficient for the compound. Hence, there is a need for a prediction tool that can effectively capture the role of both the chemical structural variation of OC as well as foc in the prediction approach. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy offers a potential alternative to the K[subscript]oc approach because IR spectra contain information on the amount and nature of both organic and mineral soil components. The potential of mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for predicting K[subscript]d values of a moderately hydrophobic pesticide, diuron, was investigated. A calibration set of 101 surface soils from South Australia was characterized for reference sorption data (K[subscript]d and K[subscript]oc) and foc as well as IR spectra. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was employed to harness the apparent complexity of IR spectra by reducing the dimensionality of the data. The MIR-PLS model was developed and validated by dividing the initial data set into corresponding calibration and validation sets. The developed model showed promising performance in predicting K[subscript]d values for diuron and proved to be a more efficacious than the K[subscript]oc model. The significant statistical superiority of the MIR-PLS model over the K[subscript]oc model was caused by some calcareous soils which were outliers for the K[subscript]oc model. Apart from these samples, the performance of the two compared models was essentially similar. The existence of carbonate peaks in the MIR-PLS loadings of the MIR based model suggested that carbonate minerals may interfere or affect the sorption. This requires further investigation. Some other concurrent studies suggested excellent quality of prediction of soil properties by NIR spectroscopy when applied to homogenous samples. Next, therefore, the performance of visible near-infrared (VNIR) and MIR spectroscopy was thoroughly compared for predicting both foc and diuron K[subscript]d values in soils. Some eleven calcareous soils were added to the initial calibration set for an attempt to further investigate the effect of carbonate minerals on sorption. MIR spectroscopy was clearly a more accurate predictor of foc and K[subscript]d in soils than VNIR spectroscopy. Close inspection of spectra showed that MIR spectra contain more relevant and straightforward information regarding the chemistry of OC and minerals than VNIR and thus useful in modelling sorption and OC content. Moreover, MIR spectroscopy provided a better (though still not great) estimation of sorption in calcareous soils than either VNIR spectroscopy or the K[subscript]oc model. Separate research is recommended to fully explore the unusual sorption behaviour of diuron in calcareous soils. In the last experiment, two dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance/infrared heterospectral correlation analyses revealed that MIR spectra contain specific and clear signals related to most of the major NMR-derived carbon types whereas NIR spectra contain only a few broad and overlapped peaks weakly associated with aliphatic carbons. 2D heterospectral correlation analysis facilitated accurate band assignments in the MIR and NIR spectra to the NMR-derived carbon types in isolated SOM. In conclusion, the greatest advantage of the MIR-PLS model is the direct estimation of Kd based on integrated properties of organic and mineral components. In addition, MIR spectroscopy is being used increasingly in predicting various soil properties including foc, and therefore, its simultaneous use for K[subscript]d estimation is a resource-effective and attractive practice. Moreover, it has the advantage of being fast and inexpensive with a high repeatability, and unlike the K[subscript]oc approach, MIR-PLS shows a better potential for extrapolating applications in data-poor regions. Where available, MIR spectroscopy is highly recommended over NIR spectroscopy. 2D correlation spectroscopy showed promising potential for providing rich insight and clarification into the thorough study of soil IR spectra.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infrared spectroscopy; Pesticide; Diuron; Soil sorption; Soil organic carbon; Chemometrics; Partial least squares; Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of ORF pCT0018 for copper homeostasis in Listeria monocytogenes strain DRDC8.</field><field name="creator">Hii, Mei Mei</field><field name="description">Sequence analysis of part of a large plasmid carried by Australian environmental isolate of Listeria monocytogenes strain DRDC8 has lead to identification of an islet of genes that encode proteins similar to copper binding and transport genes found in other Gram positive bacteria. Comparative sequence analysis showed that there are at least four genes (pCT0017, pCT0018, pCT0019 and ctpA) on this islet predicted to be involved in copper homeostasis. One of these, ctpA, is predicted to encode a P-type ATPase with a function analogous to CopA, a copper transporting gene in Enterococcus hirae. ORF pCT0017 is likely to be a CopY-like regulatory protein which could control the expression of ctpA. ORF pCT0019 is predicted to be a Cu&#178;&#8314; binding protein. In addition, two genes located downstream of the ctpA are predicted to encode a two component regulatory system region. The predicted function of ORF pCT0018 is not clear. A related chromosomal gene (cutR) is predicted to also encode a copper transporting P-type ATPase. To investigate the role of the protein encoded by pCT0018, the growth behavior of L. monocytogenes strain DRDC8, other strains carrying mutations within pCT0018, pCT0019, cutR and ctpA, as well as strains cured of the large plasmid, were grown under conditions of copper stress and starvation. The growth data showed that with the exception of strain DRDC8 and other strains carrying ctpA, most were unable to grow at higher copper concentration (&gt;15 mM CuSO&#8324;) and suggested that the copper homeostasis genes located on the large plasmid are associated with tolerance to high levels of copper. Strain DSE955PL, which carries a cutR mutation and is cured of the large plasmid, was the most sensitive (&lt;5 mM CuSO&#8324;). This indicated that proteins encoded by plasmid genes work synergistically to confer tolerance to copper. Of most interest was the fact that a pCT0018 mutant was more sensitive (&lt;15 mM CuSO&#8324;) to high levels of copper than the wild type parent DRDC8 (&lt;20 mM CuSO&#8324;). This suggested that ORF pCT0018 was necessary for copper tolerance. To investigate the effects of insertion mutations in pCT0017, pCT0018 and ctpA on copper uptake and export, the levels of copper accumulated by these strains was assessed using atomic absorption spectroscopy. A significant difference in copper accumulation among the bacteria strains was observed when either LEB or BHI media were used to culture the bacteria. This data suggested that the growth medium chemicals influence the levels of copper accumulated by cells. However, the effect of these media on bacteria growth rates during copper stress was not significant. Atomic absorption analysis of intracellular copper accumulation suggested that DSE955PL and DSE955 (a chromosome mutant) were able to accumulate copper (80 - 110 mg.g&#713;&#185; dry weight of cells), whereas DRDC8 and strains carrying mutations in pCT0018, ctpA, and strains cured of the large plasmid, were less able to accumulate copper (30 - 70 mg.g&#713;&#185; dry weight of cells). This data suggested that cutR may encode a copper export system and that ctpA is involved in copper uptake. To investigate the gene expression profile for pCT0018 under elevated copper, reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect transcripts encoding pCT0017, pCT0018, pCT0019 and pCT0020 from RNA extracted from L. monocytogenes strain DRDC8 following culture at elevated levels of copper. Although transcripts for each of the target genes were detected, transcription was not responsive to copper, nor was the pattern of transcription consistent with that expected for a single operon. To directly determine whether the protein encoded by the pCT0018 open reading frame was able to bind copper, this gene was cloned in pET15b in frame with an N-terminal Histag and expressed in E. coli. The expressed protein was purified with a Ni-NTA column and shown to contain copper. Attempts to directly show that protein pCT0018 could bind copper by Cu-IMAC were unable to unequivocally show that the protein was immobilized on the column. Purified protein was used to raise a polyclonal antiserum in rabbit and the antiserum was used for Western analysis to test expression of pCT0018 by wild type L. monocytogenes DRDC8 and specific gene mutants. Although the antiserum bound to purified protein, it was not possible to demonstrate binding to native pCT0018 in cell lysates prepared from L. monocytogenes DRDC8. SDS-PAGE of cytoplasmic and cell envelope proteins isolated from L. monocytogenes strains was used to identify proteins expressed in response to copper stress and starvation. No significant differences in protein profiles for cytoplasmic protein were observed. However, copper-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Cu-IMAC) showed that expression of a number of copper binding proteins were differentially expressed by DRDC8 following growth in copper stress and starvation conditions. Three of these proteins were selected for amino sequence analysis by MALDI-TOFF MS. Two were confirmed to be L. monocytogenes non-heme iron-binding ferritin and a thiol peroxidase, both of which bind copper. The other protein was similar to an unknown protein from L. monocytogenes. Interestingly, no proteins directly implicated with the copper homeostasis islet were identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Listeria monocytogenes; Copper transport; Homeostasis; Cop operon; CopY; CopZ, CtpA; Copper tolerance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of CBFA2T3: a breast cancer tumour suppressor from chromosome band 16q24.3</field><field name="creator">Saif, Zarqa</field><field name="description">Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 16q is an early event occurring in 36-60% of primary sporadic breast cancers. CBFA2T3 (MTG16) is a putative breast cancer tumour suppressor gene, localized at chromosome band 16q24.3. CBFA2T3 (MTG16) belongs to the CBFA2T protein family and shares a high homology with other two members, CBFA2T1 (MTG8) and CBFA2T2 (MTGR1). CBFA2T1 and CBFA2T3 proteins form transcriptional repressor complexes with the DNA binding zinc finger proteins like BCL6, PLZF, Gfi1 and ZNF652. CBFA2T3 protein exists as isoform &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; that arise from alternate start sites. These isoform differ in their N-terminal sequences. Previous studies determined that CBFA2T3a localized to the nucleolus, while CBFA2T3b has a putative role as tumour suppressor protein. The present study confirms that the database entries of CBFA2T3a are incomplete and an extended N-terminus region is present to CBFA2T3a (NCBI NM_005187) isoform by RTPCR and DNA sequencing. Two rabbit polyclonal anti CBFA2T3 antibodies were raised against the region unique to CBFA2T3. These antibodies specifically detect the endogenous CBFA2T3 proteins and not CBFA2T1 and CBFA2T2. Cell fractionation studies show that endogenous CBFA2T3a localized to the cytoplasm, while CBFA2T3b targeted to the nucleus. The N-terminus region specific to &#8220;a&#8221; isoform determined the cytoplasmic localization. The detailed studies show that CBFA2T3a localized to centrosome and this was confirmed by co&#8211;localization with known centrosomal proteins &#947;- tubulin. This was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation of &#947;-tubulin with N-terminus regions of CBFA2T3a protein. Further investigation showed that CBFA2T3a localizes to the centrosome through out the centrosomal duplication. Presence of CBFA2T3a on procentriole was further confirmed by co-localization with known proteins having a crucial role in centrosome duplication like HsSAS6 and polyglutamilated tubulin. Experiments were conducted to determined if the different subcellular localization of &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; isoforms resulted into functional differences between two isoforms. Immunoprecipitation experiments with known DNA binding proteins like BCL6 and PLZF showed that CBFA2T3b interacts with BCL6, while no interaction was found with PLZF. Consistent with the known transcriptional co-repressor function, real time RT-PCR showed that CBFA2T3b has an additive effect on BCL6 mediated repression of its target cyclin D2, while no effect was observed with CBFA2T3a. Real time RT-PCR data also showed that BCL6 not only recruits CBFA2T3b to repress its target but also have repressive effects on CBFA2T3 transcription. CBFA2T3b transcription regulation by BCL6 was found to be mediated through one or two BCL6 putative binding sites in CBFA2T3b promoter. Immuno histochemical studies were carried out to analyse CBFA2T3b function as a breast cancer tumour suppressor. CBFA2T3 proteins are highly expressed in epithelial cell lineage of normal breast ducts, while its expression is lost in some tumours. CBFA2T3 expression was further analysed in a cohort of commercially available breast tumour sections. Data from these studies showed the loss of CBFA2T3 nuclear expression in some tumours, which was significantly correlated with tumours positive for HER2 expression, molecular subtypes and histological staging of the tumours. CBFA2T3 cytoplasmic expression was also down regulated in tumour sections. A significant association of CBFA2T3 cytoplasmic expression was observed with the TNM grading for tumour invasion and centrosomal abnormalities in BR701 TMA. Knock down studies using shRNA were conducted to investigate the role of CBFA2T3a. Following CBFA2T3 knock down in cells with minimal CBFA2T3b expression, an increase in centrosomal abnormalities was observed. These abnormalities were associated with a significant increase in metaphase anomalies. Since the &#8220;a&#8221; isoform is localized to cytoplasm and particularly centrosome, it was considered that this isoform is determining centrosome integrity. This work has provided a new insight into the localization pattern of CBFA2T3 isoforms, as CBFA2T3a and b isoforms were localized to different cellular compartments and were involved in distinct functions. CBFA2T3b function as a transcriptional co repressor, CBFA2T3b expression was lost in a group of breast tumours sections. Given that CBFA2T3a has a critical centrosomal function, the expression of this isoform would be expected to be maintained, even in the absence of the CBFA2T3b isoform in tumours. CBFA2T3a specific knock down studies may give a full insight on direct targets of CBFA2T3a, having a controlling role in normal centrosome duplication cycle.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CBFA2T3a; CBFA2T3b; CBFA2T3 expression; CBFA2T3 interacting proteins; BCL6; PLZF; CDFA2T3aT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The materiality and volatility of comprehensive income : a thesis presented partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business Studies in Accountancy at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schr&#246;der, Laura Babett</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to investigate the materiality and volatility of comprehensive income for non financial firms in a non US environment. As the FASB and IASB are planning to require the reporting of comprehensive income in a single performance statement, it is important to resolve the issues surrounding the materiality and the volatility of comprehensive income. This study investigates the materiality of comprehensive income and its components in relation to total comprehensive income and closing equity for 37 non financial companies listed on the NZX from 2003 to 2008. Moreover, the cumulative impact of comprehensive income on equity over time is investigated. Further the volatility of comprehensive income is compared to the volatility of net income. This study also investigates the impact of the change to NZ IFRS on comprehensive income The results show that other comprehensive income is material in relation to total comprehensive income, but not in relation to closing equity. Moreover, some components of comprehensive income have a cumulative effect over time on closing equity. Comprehensive income is more volatile than net income. However, these findings are due to asset revaluations, which is the most dominant component of other comprehensive income. Though, all components of comprehensive income are significant for some firm year observations. Further, the move to NZ IFRS affects the materiality of some components of other comprehensive income and reduces the volatility of comprehensive income compared to net income. This study provides evidence that other comprehensive income is material for non financial firms in a non US environment. This suggests that it should be displayed clearly in the financial statement in order to be taken into consideration by financial statement users. Further, this study provides evidence that the difference in volatility between comprehensive income and net income in New Zealand can be avoided by choosing the cost method when measuring assets after recognition.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comprehensive income</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Accountancy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of decision science to aid selection of genetically superior animals : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sherriff, Ryan Leith</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with a theoretical simulation model for pig breeding, as part of the ongoing search for the &#8220;perfect&#8221; genotype. The starting point is an additive model to investigate how accurately the classical, infinitesimal model predicts genetic gain for traits controlled by few loci and few alleles. This initial investigation demonstrates that the infinitesimal model is robust, providing that at least 15 loci are controlling a trait and there is symmetry in the allele distributions. A Genotype-Pig (GE-Pig) model is then developed to apply the additive effects of alleles on sub-phenotypic traits like maximum protein deposition, minimum lipid to protein content in the whole body, ad libitum digestible energy intake, energy for maintenance requirement and water content in the whole body. These parameters are then used in a nutrient partitioning simulation model to growth a pig and calculate traditional breeding traits such as average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, and backfat thickness for any combination of alleles. Three algorithms, Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, and Simulated Annealing, are used to investigate the GE-Pig model and find optimal combination of alleles for different dietary and selection objective situations. The two diets investigated were either of a low or high quality, and the three selection objectives used were, maximising average daily gain, minimizing feed conversion ratio, and minimizing back fat. A graphical method is developed for easy comparison of the genotypes. Of the algorithms, the Genetic Algorithm performed the best, followed by Tabu Search and finally Simulated Annealing. It is demonstrated that, in general, there is a different, single, optimum for any given selection objective and diet. However under the back fat selection objective, both diets produce the same optimal genotype. Also there are many similarities between the optima for the average daily gain and feed conversion ratio selection objectives. When the theoretical minimum number of generations of selection to the optima is considered, the feed conversion ratio selection objective is the quickest for a breeding program to achieve the optimal solutions, followed by back fat, then average daily gain. It is demonstrated that diet also has an effect on the theoretical number of generations. A Multiple selection objective, using relative economic values applied to the individual selection objectives, is also investigated. For both diets, the majority of the multiple selection objective solutions are in the vicinity of the feed conversion ratio optima, indicating that feed conversion ratio is the most prominent factor. It is also demonstrated that the optimal solution is most affected by the objective parameter weights under low diet conditions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swine breeding</field><field name="subject">Pig breeding</field><field name="subject">Decision science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300401 Animal breeding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Past, present and future perspectives on the role of counselling in social work in Aotearoa New Zealand : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Staniforth, Barbara Lynn</field><field name="description">Since the profession of social work began, there has been debate about whether it should be involved in helping individuals make change, or in encouraging societal change. Towards gaining an understanding of how this debate has played out in Aotearoa New Zealand, this research explores the question &#8220;What are the past present and future perspectives on the role of counselling in social work in Aotearoa New Zealand?&#8221; A mixed methodology format was used in this research. Qualitative interviews with individuals who had helped create the professions of social work, counselling and psychology were conducted to help understand the historical development of counselling within social work, and the factors which had impacted upon it. Questionnaires were then sent out to 985 members of the Aotearoa New Zealand Association of Social Workers that asked about members&#8217; current views on, and practice of, counselling within social work. The research shows that social work developed late in New Zealand within a welfare state where governments questioned the need for it. With social work education not widely available until the 1970s there was limited training in counselling type approaches. The drive for professionalism (often aligned with those doing counselling) was tempered by those mindful of community and bicultural commitments due to differing ideologies and lack of access to education. Tangata whenua have had a major impact on the development of social work, and counselling within it. Respondents in this research were clear that aspects of counselling fell within their definitions of social work and that counselling in Aotearoa New Zealand should hold a strengths-based, collaborative stance that recognised the importance of a bicultural perspective. Most respondents indicated that they did some amount of counselling within their practice, but only 34% of respondents felt that their basic social work qualification had prepared them adequately or really well for their counselling role. The majority of questionnaire respondents had undertaken additional training to help them with their counselling role and over two-thirds indicated a strong desire to engage in further study in counselling. Registration of the helping professions presents challenges that include the potential for unhelpful competition between them. The thesis concludes that there is a need for more counselling education options for social workers and that there is a need for the profession of social work to formally define its scopes of practice.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselling</field><field name="subject">Social work training</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370204 Counselling , welfare and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimising weighted mean distortion : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McKubre-Jordens, Maarten Nicolaas</field><field name="description">There has been considerable recent interest in geometric function theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, harmonic mappings, and the connection of these to minimal energy phenomena. This work explores Nitsche's 1962 conjecture concerning the nonexistence of harmonic mappings between planar annuli, cast in terms of distortion functionals. The connection between the Nitsche problem and the famous Gr&#246;tzsch problem is established by means of a weight function. Traditionally, these kinds of problems are investigated in the class of quasiconformal mappings, and the assumption is usually made a priori that solutions preserve various symmetries. Here the conjecture is solved in the much wider class of mappings of finite distortion, symmetry-preservation is proved, and ellipticity of the variational equations concerning these sorts of general problems is established. Furthermore, various alternative interpretations of the weight function introduced herein lead to an interesting analysis of a much wider variety of critical phenomena -- when the weight function is interpreted as a thickness, density or metric, the results lead to a possible model for tearing or breaking phenomena in material science. These physically relevant critical phenomena arise, surprisingly, out of purely theoretical considerations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Weighted mean distortion</field><field name="subject">Weight function</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brand-sponsored versus consumer-generated online brand communities : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Business Studies in Marketing at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Stephanie J</field><field name="description">This research focuses on online brand communities from a brand management perspective. The purpose of this study is to contribute to understanding of online brand communities by examining differences in brand-sponsored and consumer-generated online brand communities, and to extend research into online brand communities by examining online brand communities for a sports brand. The first phase of this study investigates how consumption practices differ in brand-sponsored and consumer-generated online brand communities. Online brand communities for the All Blacks brand were selected as a case study for this research. The All Blacks brand-sponsored and consumer-generated online brand communities were observed for eight weeks and afterwards discussions in both communities were analysed for two weeks to identify consumption practices. Ethical issues pertinent to this research design meant raw comments and discussions could not be collected and instead discussions were immediately analysed through a coding process. The second phase of this study investigates marketing industry expert views on brand-sponsored and consumer-generated online brand communities. Interviews with three representatives from service and sports organisations were held. The findings from this research contribute to literature on online brand communities by demonstrating brand-sponsored and consumer-generated online brand communities differ in consumption practices, language, self-expression, modes of interaction, and legitimacy. This study also extends research into online brand communities by investigating online brand communities for sports brands. Findings imply there are minimal differences between online brand communities for service or sports brands compared with online brand communities for goods. The outcomes from this research may also have a number of implications for marketers, hoping to capitalise on the growth of online brand communities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand-sponsored online brand communities</field><field name="subject">Brand management</field><field name="subject">Consumer-generated online brand communities</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choiseul and the missionaries : the Methodist Mission on Choiseul, Solomon Islands, 1905-1941 : a thesis submitted for the degree of Master of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Lynne</field><field name="description">This project will examine the impact and the progress of Methodist missionary work on Choiseul from 1905 to 1941. The predominant European contact on Choiseul was with missionaries and this was significantly more recent than many of the other islands in the group. Choiseul was unattractive for settlement or commercial development because the lack of arable land meant that it was unsuitable for large plantations to be established. A lacuna exists in the current historiography of the Solomons with regard to Choiseul. A study of the Methodist Mission on Choiseul offers the opportunity to examine the development of the mission, and the people on the island during the period under study, and fill that gap. The nature of conversion to Christianity on Choiseul, and the way the missionaries, including European, Solomon Islanders and Pacific Islanders, operated, cooperated, and disagreed with the Choiseulese and with each other will be examined to help answer the question, to what extent was Choiseul a Methodist, or a missionary, island.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choiseul</field><field name="subject">Methodist Mission</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430103 History: Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-skilled, low socio-economic, young, co-resident, working fathers : their experience of fatherhood : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rouch, Gareth</field><field name="description">Low-skilled, low socio-economic status, young, co-resident, working fathers: Their experience of fatherhood Using open-ended interview techniques, 23 low-skilled, low socio-economic status fathers aged 20-29 were interviewed about their experience of fatherhood. All participants were in unskilled jobs and all lived with and supported their partners and child/children. This population of fathers is generally overlooked by researchers. Because they take responsibility for some of society&#8217;s most vulnerable families and children, understanding how they conceive of their role as fathers can promote the welfare of those families and children. Participants were recruited by casual connections, snowballing and advertisement. The interviews explored the participants' experience of fatherhood and their reasons for being active and committed family members. Focus was given to how they made sense of fatherhood in terms of their life course. Participants had two interviews, the first generic and the second idiographic. Interviews were tape-recorded and later transcribed. A social constructionist approach was used: transcripts were analysed by identifying and examining the primary domains in which participants experienced fatherhood. Participants spoke of fatherhood as an affective activity, the primary object of good fatherhood being to maintain an emotional bond with one&#8217;s children. Being a good father was thought to involve eschewing deleterious family practices such as those which had marred their own childhoods. In this regard, participants saw themselves as repairing their family-of-origin's dysfunctional style. Providing was described as a core feature of fatherhood &#8211; subsidiary to, but corollary on, being an emotionally-engaged father. Good fathers were described as committed providers, albeit participants did not consider their own limited earning capacity to compromise their fatherhood. Obtaining a job and providing for one&#8217;s family was one of the &#8216;pro-socializing&#8217; effects of fatherhood. Participants considered fatherhood to not only improve but to also redeem their lives, giving a purpose and focus they had lacked prior to their becoming parents. Being a good father also involved being a good partner. For many of the participants, this involved adopting non-gendered roles in the home. The sharing of housework and childcare improved home life by reducing the partner's workload. Those who failed to adopt the gender-neutral stance acknowledged this as a personal shortcoming that they planned to remedy. Fatherhood for these 23 interviewees was one of the few means by which they could obtain social value and status as adults. They lacked access to financial resources, education or supportive family connections, but fatherhood was a domain in which they could present themselves as significant members of society. It also provided a network of emotional relationships which promoted their sense of self-worth and their social and emotional wellbeing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatherhood</field><field name="subject">Fathers</field><field name="subject">Low socio-economic status</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hide and seek : parents' perspectives on children's access to health care : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pocknall, Helen</field><field name="description">Children are often referred to as the 'hidden' generation, a powerless group who in infancy and childhood depend on their parents and families/whanau to ensure they receive everything in life required to enable them to grow into healthy young people and adults. Some are more disadvantaged than others due to the socioeconomic circumstances they grow up in. This can have lasting effects on their health in childhood with associated impacts later in life. In New Zealand the populations of children most disadvantaged are those from Maori, Pacific and other low income families/whanau. The disparities that exist between children from these populations and other groups whilst lessening, is still significant. The purpose of this study was to explore with Maori, Pacific and low income parents and caregivers why they choose to 'seek' health services for their children, or not as the case may be. Patterns of use are established early in life therefore it is important to understand children's health care use. The literature suggests that children's access to health care is influenced by predisposing factors such as their socioeconomic status, ethnicity, the availability of services, choice of providers, availability of school&#8211;based health services, outreach services, relationships between the community and health service providers and having a regular source of primary health care. A qualitative exploratory design was the methodology chosen for this research. A modified 'community as partner' model (Anderson, 2008) formed the conceptual framework for the research. Sixteen Maori, Pacific and Pakeha parents and caregivers participated in three focus groups to discuss their perceptions of children's access to health care. Thematic analysis was used to identify codes, categories, themes and sub themes from the data. The New Zealand Child Health Strategy (Ministry of Health, 1998) was used as a model to inform the discussion. The main themes were: reality of life, visibility, knowing you, knowing me and kids come first. The findings suggest that relationships with primary health care providers, the cost of health care for children over five years, awareness of services and a need to prioritise children's needs, enable or prevent children's access to health care. Decisions made regarding further service provision for children will be enhanced by health providers and practitioners having a clearer understanding of the enablers and barriers to access and the factors that influence parental choice of services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child health care</field><field name="subject">Health care access</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development impact of workers' remittances in Fiji : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Prakash, Nilesh</field><field name="description">Remittances by international migrants have become an important source of finance for livelihood development amongst the households in Fiji. This is substantiated by the country&#8217;s rising migrant stock as a result of unstable political environment and the increasing economic opportunities for skilled manpower. It has been noted that the flow of remittances to Fiji excelled the amount of other capital inflows such as foreign aid and foreign direct investment and have surpassed commodity export earnings in the recent years. This has made remittances the second largest foreign exchange earner in Fiji after tourism. This thesis examines the developmental impact of workers&#8217; remittances in Fiji, particularly its impact on economic growth, financial sector development, welfare development of the recipient households and an examination of the sustainability of remittance flows. Using an extended neoclassical framework, the empirical evidence finds a positive impact of remittances on economic growth and financial sector development. The welfare development hypothesis is tested using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data. This is analyzed first, by examining the expenditure patterns of the remittance-recipient households, the poverty and inequality effects followed by an assessment of human capital development impact of remittances. The empirical results show that households which receive remittances do not only expend their remittance income on basic consumption but have other substantive uses such as that on education of children, housing and expenditure on durables and nondurables. The poverty and inequality reducing effects of remittances, employ two counterfactual methodologies to estimate first, what the poverty and inequality indicators would be in a scenario where remittances are treated as an exogenous addition to household income. Second, it tests the effect in a scenario without migration and remittances, which treats remittances as a substitute for migrants&#8217; foregone earnings. The results show strong poverty reducing effects of remittances irrespective of the methodology used while the effects on income distribution are not unambiguous. The results obtained for the human capital development analysis indicate the positive role of remittances in providing education opportunities for children in the recipient households. In noting these positive effects of remittances, it must however be acknowledged that the flow of remittances has to be sustainable overtime for households to benefit from human development. From a survey of Fijian-New Zealander migrant households, this study examines the remittance-sustainability debate. The results suggest that a combination of factors such as income of migrants, acquisition of higher education prior to migration and the intention to inherit assets from families in Fiji contribute to continued flow of remittances. These results do not support the hypothesis of remittance decay amongst Fijian migrants in New Zealand but reflect a strong altruistic motive of remittances sent to households in Fiji as insurance against economic shocks. This highlights the importance of development policy in facilitating the flows of migrant remittances for the socio-economic progress of Fiji.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workers' remittances</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Fijian-New Zealander</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the beginning : a book arts exploration of the creation account in Genesis : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for a degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Park, Hana</field><field name="description">This research project will explore Book Arts through the book of Genesis, focusing on the first seven days of creation.

There is no easy answer to this problem. "Damned if they do, damned if they don't," describes the dilemma facing female elite athletes, and their sports manager in determining how best to present themselves publicly.
Professional sport requires professional management. Sport managers work in a highly competitive industry and part of that involves winning sponsorship dollars from major corporations; an area closely related to the securing of media coverage. Sponsors are attracted to sports teams and athletes who command media interest. Therefore within the sports industry there is a need for sports managers with a comprehensive understanding of both the media and sponsorship. The representation of elite women athletes is a particular challenge because many want an image that promotes their athleticism while still maintaining their feminity.
ALPHA is the first Greek letter of the alphabet and is often used to describe something new and original. This research centres on the development and trial of a new media evaluation tool. The ALPHA (analysis of text, location, photographs, headings of athletes) media analysis model provides sports managers and students with a comprehensive tool to analyse, evaluate and understand the current level of media coverage of their particular sport over a period of time. Application of the model was tested on newspaper coverage of elite female sports during the Olympics and a non-Olympic period. The research illuminated key issues relevant to the media coverage of elite female athletes. From the results teaching boxes have been developed in order to illustrate how use of this tool can enhance the education of sports managers.
While this research showed that there had been some improvement in the amount of media coverage given to elite female athletes, there is still a need for sports managers to work towards improving the quality of that coverage. The ALPHA media analysis model provides sports managers and athletes with a means to make informed choices because they can effectively evaluate media coverage. As such this research adds to the overall development and professionalisation of the sports industry.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">female athletes</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20100430.105404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers.

First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Networking for gold : a multi-level analysis to explain network organising dynamics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Marketing at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Martin, Simon Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research is to understand how the multiple levels within networks influence the organising dynamics in an intentionally formed network through the measurement of tie strength. This is a significant contribution because previous research is based on network studies in which only one level is considered, most of the research is conceptually undeveloped in the area. The research also addresses the measurement of the strength of relationships rather than just their existence or non-existence. Furthermore, this study examines intentionally created networks &#8211; an area where there is currently very little research. Thus the study is significant because the new data contributes to the marketing research environment and can be presented to examine findings in other research contexts, including the social policy and not-for-profit sectors. To address the aim and context of the study it was necessary to understand a national programme which had global objectives. The research involved a multi-method approach that utilised a single case-study strategy with multiple embedded cases consisting of three interdependent, intentionally formed networks, each with a central broker, in the elite and high-performance sport sector in New Zealand. The overall contributions of the research were: (1) The identification of a new network type, termed here as a structured network. (2) The finding that networks that are intentionally created and managed can be durable and effective, and this is dependent on the role of the central broker. This finding has obvious implications for practitioners involved in such networks and for governments that are interested in creating them. (3) The finding that cross-level pressures influence network effectiveness. (4) The finding that relationships developed at the pre-network formation stage contribute to network effectiveness. (5) And finally, the identification of a new stage of intentional network formation. This stage was taken by the New Zealand government issuing a tender in order to gauge the level of interest and the resources available to provide a network of services before establishing it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">sport sector</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic non-market valuation techniques : theory and application to ecosystems and ecosystem services : a case study of the restoration and preservation of Pekapeka Swamp : an application of the contingent valuation method in measuring the economic value of restoring and preserving ecosytem services in an impaired wetland : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Economics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ndebele, Tom</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the theoretical basis of non-market valuation techniques; discusses in detail, the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and the Travel Cost Method (TCM); highlights the advantages and disadvantages of various non-market valuation techniques and their suitability under different conditions; and identifies the Contingent Valuation Method as the most appropriate non-market valuation technique to apply to Pekapeka Swamp, the case study site. The overall objective of the study is to apply the most appropriate non-market valuation technique to estimate the total economic value (TEV) of the restoration and preservation of Pekapeka Swamp and to test Hawke&#8217;s Bay Regional Council&#8217;s (HBRC) restoration programme for the Pekapeka Swamp using economic efficiency criteria. An appropriate contingent valuation mail survey questionnaire was designed to elicit responses to the dichotomous choice (DC) and open-ended valuation questions, and to collect socio-economic data and information on households&#8217; attitude towards the environment. Responses to the survey questionnaire were analysed (using ordinary least squares regression for the open ended question, and logistic regression, for the DC question) to identify the factors that influence households&#8217; willingness to pay (WTP) for the restoration and preservation of the Pekapeka Swamp and to estimate TEV. A number of functional forms of the logit and open-ended WTP models were fitted from which WTP functions were estimated. Households were asked a DC question followed by an open-ended question regarding the value they placed on the restoration and preservation of Pekapeka Swamp. Out of an initial mail-out of 958 questionnaires, an overall response rate of 46.13% was achieved after two follow-ups. Results from the final usable sample of 231, after removing protests and inconsistent responses, indicate that households in the Hawke&#8217;s Bay region would pay, on average, between NZ$30.00 and NZ$76.89 per annum for five years. Unit value ranges between NZ$17,898 and NZ$45,866 per hectare per year; and net present values for the restoration and preservation programme for Pekapeka Swamp based on our &#8216;best estimates&#8217; range between NZ$5.05 million and NZ$18.20 million depending on the model and discount rate used.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation economics</field><field name="subject">Non-market valuation</field><field name="subject">Pekapeka Swamp</field><field name="subject">Contingent valuation method</field><field name="subject">Travel cost method</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340202 Environment and resource economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of the promoter in Drosophila dosage compensation : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Laverty, Corey</field><field name="description">Dosage compensation is the equalisation of gene expression from unequal doses of genes. Drosophila males up-regulate transcription from their single X chromosome to equal that from the two female X chromosomes. Five malespecific lethal (msl) genes are required in males, and encode the main agents of the up-regulation. At least these proteins, together with either or both of two noncoding RNAs, form the MSL chromatin-modifying complex. Female-specific translational repression of a key component, msl2, limits the complex to males. The MSL complex binds to the X chromosome at hundreds of distinct loci, acetylates nucleosomes, and de-condenses the chromatin. Together with possibly many co-factors, the transcriptional up-regulation caused by MSL complex appears to counteract repressive factors to achieve an average effect of transcriptional doubling. Here, I have studied the initiation of MSL regulation on the X chromosome with a variety of approaches. In order to study early events, dosage compensation was induced in females with ectopic expression of msl2 from the tetracycline system. However, low background expression without activation prohibited further studies. To identify novel factors that affect dosage compensation, a reporter gene system based on variable eye size was evaluated. The system provided a dose-dependent phenotype, but could not report additional up-regulation by the MSL complex, and was thus unsuitable for the proposed mutational screen. The quantifiable lacZ gene was measured in a strict comparison of expression from an eye-specfic (GMR) or a constitutive (armadillo) promoter. At defined locations on the X chromsome, armadillo-lacZ acquired local compensation, but GMR-lacZ did not. Further modifications upstream of GMR-lacZ increased the response, and confirmed the importance of the promoter in attraction of dosage compensation. To corroborate this with the established importance of genic sequences in MSL attraction, a combinatorial model of attraction is proposed. The relative importance of early or constitutive expression was also tested, by providing GMR-lacZ with extra expression through the tetracycline system. A burst of embryonic expression, and constitutive expression, were both insufficient to increase dosage compensation of the transgene. Finally, the compensation of GMRmediated transgenes was confounded by &#8216;transvection&#8217; effects of chromosome pairing. This effect may have wider implications on the study of compensation at individual genes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drosophila</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Dosage compensation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a framework for evaluating the quality of instructional design ontologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Li, Xin</field><field name="description">Instructional Design (ID) ontology can be used to formally represent knowledge about the teaching and learning process, which contributes to automatic construction of personalised eLearning experiences.

It was aimed to create a new visual identity for Hyundai Motors by designing a car model forecasting and utilising methods pertinent to Hyundai Motors. Simultaneously the designed car model focuses on specifically accommodating the needs of surfers. The whole philosophy behind this particular model involves three important elements of Visual Identity as pointed out by Warell; recognition, comprehension and association. As a result, in each stage of the design process, the model was designed and amended continuously to incorporate these three issues to create a design for Hyundai that targeted the surfing market. This research sets out a departure point for designing differentiated vehicle concepts for Hyundai by targeting a niche market. The Exodus was designed for a particular demographic and a subculture. The targeted market began with participants of Extreme Sports such as snowboarding, windsurfing, and surfing, but was narrowed down to surfers, because they had specific requirements that were not well catered via by existing vehicles. These requirements also translated into specific design features that allowed the development of a strongly differentiate of vehicle concept. In this way the Exodus represents an example of how specific and user needs can drive differentiated design in both a practical and visually expressive way. This process was facilitated by way of three major research stages. Firstly, a field trip to Piha, one of Auckland&#8217;s most popular surfing beaches was conducted in order to find out more about surfing culture and as a general means of vehicle observation. Secondly, informed interviews were conducted in order to gather qualitative information to generate specific user requirements and inform design development that would meet the needs of surfers. Existing car designs types were analysed to extract any design features and attributes suitable for surfers. Thirdly, a comparative analysis of two established vehicle brands, alongside Hyundai was undertaken in order to reveal the weaknesses of Hyundai&#8217;s visual identity. This phase then culminated in a research model specifically aimed at creating a new design image for them. Based on requirements developed using the above methods, the design were developed through an interactive process of sketching, modeling and critique. The aim was to create a car with an advanced design that met the functional needs of the surfing market. The main focus was to create a specific, differentiated brand image based on association, comprehension and recognition for the Hyundai.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hyundai Exodus</field><field name="subject">Car design</field><field name="subject">Vehicle design</field><field name="subject">Surfing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290400 Automotive Engineering::290401 Automotive engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting a fair deal: efficient risk allocation in the private provision of infrastructure</field><field name="creator">Arndt, Raphael Henry</field><field name="description">Over the last decade there has been an increasing trend by governments in Australia and throughout the world to use the skills and expertise of the private sector in developing and implementing infrastructure projects.

The only industry of substance that was acknowledged by these writers was prostitution. The Museum of Victoria has erected an exhibition, and prepared a web-site, about Little Lon based on McCarthy&#8217;s report. In recent years Alan Mayne, Tim Murray and Susan Lawrence have published research questioning the slum image and have argued instead that the precinct was, essentially, a residential neighbourhood.

Accurate models of these systems and the changes occurring to them are required for interpreters to understand, reason over, and learn from evolution of these systems. Ontologies purport to model the semantics of the domain encapsulated in the system. Existing approaches to using ontologies do not capture the rationale for change but instead focus on the direct differences between one version of a model and the subsequent version. Some changes to ontologies are caused by a larger context or goal that is temporally separated from each specific change to the ontology. Current approaches to supporting change in ontologies are insufficient for reasoning over changes and allow changes that lead to inconsistent ontologies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ontology change semantics</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of radiolabelled leukocytes to identify inflammation in horses, dogs and cats</field><field name="creator">Abushhiwa, Mohamed Hamrouni S.</field><field name="description">Human leukocytes have been radiolabelled indirectly via targeting leukocytes inside the body (in vivo) and directly by radiolabelling these cells in the laboratory (in vitro), the latter being the most commonly used.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiolabelling Leukocytes</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of three-dimensional craniofacial images: applications in forensic science, anthropology and clinical medicine</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Rebecca Valerie</field><field name="description">The principal aims of this thesis were to use digital 3D craniofacial data to measure the difference between individuals in different populations, to provide a detailed holistic description of the population at large, as well as to investigate the feasibility of classifying individuals in different populations based on the morphology of their craniofacial features.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthographic support for passing the reading hurdle in Japanese</field><field name="creator">Yencken, Lars</field><field name="description">Learning a second language is, for the most part, a day-in day-out struggle against the mountain of new vocabulary a learner must acquire.

Four thousand hectares is managed for sustainable production of indigenous timber. The aim of this study was to provide an integrated analysis of soils, soil-landform relationships, and soil-vegetation relationships at broad and detailed scales. The broad scale understandings provide a framework in which existing or future studies can be placed and the detailed studies elucidate sources of soil and forest variability.  Glacial landforms dominate. They include late Pleistocene lateral, terminal and ablation moraines, and outwash aggradation and degradation terraces. Deposits and landforms from six glacial advances have been recognised ranging from latest Last (Otira) Glaciation to Penultimate (Waimea) Glaciation. The absolute ages of landforms were established by analysis of the thickness and soil stratigraphy of loess coverbeds, augmented with radiocarbon dating and phytolith and pollen analysis.  In the prevailing high rainfall of Westland soil formation is rapid. The rate of loess accretion in Saltwater Forest (ca. 30 mm ka&#8315;&#185;) has been low enough that soil formation and loess accretion took place contemporaneously. Soils formed in this manner are known as upbuilding soils. The significant difference between upbuilding pedogenesis and pedogenesis in a topdown sense into an existing sediment body is that each subsoil increment of an upbuilding soil has experienced processes of all horizons above. In Saltwater Forest subsoils of upbuilding soils are strongly altered because they have experienced the extremely acid environment of the soil surface at some earlier time. Some soil chronosequence studies in Westland have included upbuilding soils formed in loess as the older members of the sequence. Rates and types of processes inferred from these soils should be reviewed because upbuilding is a different pedogenic pathway to topdown pedogenesis.  Landform age and morphology were used as a primary stratification for a study of the soil pattern and nature of soil variability in the 4000 ha production area of Saltwater Forest. The age of landforms (&gt; 14 ka) and rapid soil formation mean that soils are uniformly strongly weathered and leached. Soils include Humic Organic Soils, Perch-gley Podzols, Acid Gley Soils, Allophanic Brown Soils, and Orthic or Pan Podzols. The major influence on the nature of soils is site hydrology which is determined by macroscale features of landforms (slope, relief, drainage density), mesoscale effects related to position on landforms, and microscale influences determined by microtopography and individual tree effects. Much of the soil variability arises at microscales so that it is not possible to map areas of uniform soils at practical map scales. The distribution of soil variability across spatial scales, in relation to the intensity of forest management, dictates that it is most appropriate to map soil complexes with boundaries coinciding with landforms.  Disturbance of canopy trees is an important agent in forest dynamics. The frequency of forest disturbance in the production area of Saltwater Forest varies in a systematic way among landforms in accord with changes in abundance of different soils. The frequency of forest turnover is highest on landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained Organic Soils. As the abundance of better-drained soils increases the frequency of forest turnover declines. Changes in turnover frequency are reflected in the mean size and density of canopy trees (Dacrydium cupressinum) among landforms. Terrace and ablation moraine landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained soils have on average the smallest trees growing most densely. The steep lateral moraines, characterised by well drained soils, have fewer, larger trees. The changes manifested at the landform scale are an integration of processes operating over much shorter range as a result of short-range soil variability. The systematic changes in forest structure and turnover frequency among landforms and soils have important implications for sustainable forest management.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glacial stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">loess accumulation</field><field name="subject">soil stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">Aokautere Ash</field><field name="subject">oxygen isotope record</field><field name="subject">phytoliths</field><field name="subject">thermoluminescence dating</field><field name="subject">pedogenesis</field><field name="subject">soil chronosequences</field><field name="subject">soil variability</field><field name="subject">soil survey</field><field name="subject">soil-landform models</field><field name="subject">forest soils</field><field name="subject">forest disturbance</field><field name="subject">disturbance frequency</field><field name="subject">soil-vegetation relationships</field><field name="subject">windthrow</field><field name="subject">earthquakes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300606 Agroforestry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of isotopic dilution methods to the study of the dissolution of phosphate fertilisers of differing solubility in the soil</field><field name="creator">Di, Hong J.</field><field name="description">An injection technique, in which undisturbed soil cores are labelled with &#179;&#178;P to study dissolution of phosphate fertilisers in the soil, was evaluated in field and glasshouse trials. When &#179;&#178;P was injected between 0-150 mm depths of the undisturbed soil columns and fertilisers applied at the surface, the amounts of fertiliser P dissolved, as measured by the increases in the exchangeable P pools, were overestimated. Three possible reasons were suggested: (i) the interaction between surface-applied fertiliser, &#179;&#178;P injected through the whole soil column, and the vertical decline in root density, (ii) the decline of specific activity in the exchangeable P pool due to losses of &#179;&#178;P to nonexchangeable P pools and continuous addition of P from fertiliser dissolution, and (iii) non-uniform distribution of &#179;&#178;P vis-a-vis &#179;&#185;P phosphate.  The injection technique may be employed to assess the effectiveness of phosphate fertilisers by introducing a concept, the fertiliser equivalent (FE). The FE is a measure of the amounts of soil exchangeable P that the fertilisers are equivalent to in supplying P to plants, when applied at the specific location. Soluble single superphosphate (SSP) applied at the surface of undisturbed grassland soil cores (Tekapo fine sandy loam), was much more effective than surface-applied unground North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR) and 30% acidulated NCPR with phosphoric acid (NCPAPR) within the 56 day period of plant growth.  An isotopic dilution method, based on tracer kinetic theory, was developed to study the rates of dissolution (F in) and retention (F out) of phosphate fertilisers in the soil in growth chamber experiments. The estimation of F in and F out required labelling of the soils with carrier-free &#179;&#178;P and determination of the corresponding values of the specific activities of the exchangeable P pools, SA&#8321; and SA&#8322;, and the sizes of the exchangeable P pools, Q&#8321; and Q&#8322;, at times t&#8321; and t&#8322;. Most of the phosphate in the monocalcium phosphate (MCP) solution entered the exchangeable P pool immediately after addition to the soils (Tekapo fine sandy loam and Craigieburn silt loam), and there was little further phosphate input. With increasing periods of incubation, the phosphate was quickly transformed to less rapidly exchangeable forms. In the soils treated with ground North Carolina phosphate rock (&lt;150 &#181;m, NCPR) or partially acidulated (30%) NCPR with phosphoric acid (NCPAPR), the initial exchangeable P pools were not as large as those in the soils treated with MCP, but were maintained at relatively stable concentrations for extended periods, due to the continuous dissolution of PR materials and to lower rates of pretention.  An increase in P-retention caused a slight rise in the rate of PR dissolution, but also a rise in the rate of P-retention by the soil. The rate of dissolution was higher at a lower application rate in relative terms, but smaller in absolute terms. The trends in the changes of plant-available P in the soils, measured by the water extractable P, Bray I P and Olsen P, correspond to those predicted by the F in and F out values. The average rates of dissolution between 1-50 and 50-111 days estimated by the F in, however, were higher than those estimated by extractions with 0.5 M NaOH followed by 1 M HCl, and with 0.5 M BaCl&#8322;/TEA. This is partly because the Fin values reflect a plant growth effect on PR dissolution.  The relative agronomic effectiveness of NCPR and NCPAPR with respect to MCP was higher after 50 and 111 days of incubation than after 1 day. The F in values were included in all the two-variable models constructed by stepwise regression to describe the relationship between plant P uptake and soil measurements. The amounts of variation in plant P uptake accounted for by the regression model was significantly improved by including F in in the model. This indicates the importance of fertiliser dissolution rates in affecting soil P supply, when phosphate fertilisers differing in solubility are applied.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">isotopic dilution</field><field name="subject">tracer kinetics</field><field name="subject">&#179;&#178;P</field><field name="subject">phosphate dissolution</field><field name="subject">phosphate retention</field><field name="subject">plant availability</field><field name="subject">phosphate rock</field><field name="subject">partially acidulated phosphate rock</field><field name="subject">monocalcium phosphate</field><field name="subject">single superphosphate</field><field name="subject">chemical extraction</field><field name="subject">plant response</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">field trial</field><field name="subject">glasshouse trial</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::309900 Other Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::309901 Fertilisers and agrochemicals (application etc)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of behavioural intentions in the Taiwan hotel industry</field><field name="creator">Wu, Hung-Che</field><field name="description">The issue of behavioural intentions has attracted the attention of hotel marketers and academics because favourable behavioural intentions help hotels to retain customers. The marketing literature has identified that service quality, perceived value, image, customer satisfaction and demographic variables are significant determinants of behavioural intentions. This suggests that behavioural intentions are a multi-dimensional concept. Despite the importance of behavioural intentions, there is limited research on this construct in the hotel industry. The aim of this research was to gain an empirical understanding of behavioural intentions in the Taiwan hotel sector. A multi-level model was used as a framework for the analysis. The dimensions of service quality as perceived by hotel customers were identified through the literature review and focus group discussions. Hypotheses were formulated and tested to examine the interrelationships between behavioural intentions, service quality, customer satisfaction, perceived value and image, and to determine if perceived value plays a moderating role between service quality and customer satisfaction. Finally, customer perceptions of these constructs were compared based on demographic factors such as age, gender and income.   The findings of this study were based on the analysis of a sample of 580 customers who had stayed at a five-star hotel in Kaohsiung City of Taiwan. Support was found for the use of a multi-level model and the primary dimensions: Interaction Quality, Physical Environment Quality and Outcome Quality, as broad dimensions of service quality. The 12 sub-dimensions of service quality, as perceived by hotel customers, were identified. These were: Employees&#8217; Conduct, Employees&#8217; Expertise, Employees&#8217; Problem-Solving, Customer-to-Customer Interaction, D&#233;cor &amp; Ambience, Room Quality, Availability of Facility, Design, Location, Valence, Waiting Time and Sociability. The results indicated that each of the primary dimensions varied in terms of their importance to overall perceived service quality, as did the sub-dimensions of the primary dimensions. In addition, the statistical results supported a relationship between perceived value and service quality, image and service quality, customer satisfaction, perceived value, image and service quality, and behavioural intentions, image and customer satisfaction. The results also revealed that customer perceptions of the constructs were primarily affected by their purpose of travel and occupation. The results contribute to the services marketing theory by providing an empirically based insight into the service quality, perceived value, image, customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions constructs in the Taiwan hotel industry. This research also provides an analytical framework for understanding the effects of the three primary dimensions on service quality and the effect of service quality on constructs, such as, perceived value, image, customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions. This study will assist the management of the hotel industry to develop and implement a market-oriented service strategy in order to achieve a high quality of service, upgrade customers&#8217; levels of satisfaction, and create favourable future behavioural intentions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel industry</field><field name="subject">multi-level model</field><field name="subject">ervice quality</field><field name="subject">service quality dimensions</field><field name="subject">perceived value</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">behavioural intentions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty lines, household economies of scale and urban poverty in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Mok, Thai Yoong</field><field name="description">This thesis presents three essays on Malaysia&#8217;s poverty profile based on the Household Expenditure Survey (HES). The first and second studies were motivated by the shortcomings of the official poverty lines and poverty measurements. There are several conceptual and measurement problems related to evaluating the extent of poverty in Malaysia. The first study offers several alternative regional poverty analyses based on the consumption expenditure approach with varying underlying assumptions. The poverty lines are estimated using Ravallion-Bidani and Kakwani-Sajaia approaches and the consumption pattern of the 10th and 20th percentile per capita expenditure (PCE) households. Regional poverty lines based on Kakwani-Sajaia and Ravallion-Bidani lower bounds produced robust poverty measurement rankings across regions in the country for both the 10th and 20th percentile PCE households. However, for the 10th percentile PCE, Ravallion&#8217;s upper bound poverty lines do not produce robust poverty rankings. In relation to the shortcomings of the official poverty measurements, the second study analyses the economies of scale in consumption, specifically amongst poor households. Using the 10th and 20th percentile PCE households, the household size economies are estimated using specifications proposed by Deaton-Paxson and Kakwani-Son. The findings show that the economies of scale indices are sensitive to the selection of methods and sample groups. Economies of scale in poor household consumption are present for food, housing, clothing, furnishing, personal goods and miscellaneous goods. This study further suggests that these indices be used as complementary to the existing national poverty measurements.  The final study provides new insights into the limited urban poverty studies and to the new dimension of urban poverty. Using logistic regression, the determinants are analysed using the new poverty lines estimated in the earlier essay. The test of robustness of the determinants is conducted through re-estimating the logistic regression using a range of poverty lines. The findings show that education, locational dimension, foreign migrant workers and household size are significant determinants of poverty in the urban areas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poverty lines</field><field name="subject">consumer theory</field><field name="subject">household economies of scale</field><field name="subject">Seemingly Unrelated Regression</field><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">urban poverty</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Customer switching behaviour in the Chinese retail banking industry</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Dongmei</field><field name="description">With the intense competition and increasing globalization in the financial markets, bank management must develop customer-oriented strategies in order to compete successfully in the competitive retail banking environment. The longer a bank can retain a customer, the greater revenue and cost savings from that customer. However, customers are also more prone to changing their banking behaviour when they can purchase nearly identical financial products provided by the retail banks. In order to stay competitive, bank managers need to understand the factors that influence and determine consumer&#8217;s bank switching behaviour. With China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), their financial services market was liberalized and deregulated. As a result, customers have a greater choice between domestic and foreign banks. Furthermore, the emergence of the internet allows customers to access financial products without limitation, and increases the Chinese retail banks&#8217; ability to prevent customers&#8217; switching banks. This study identifies and analyses the factors that influence bank customers&#8217; switching behaviour in the Chinese retail banking industry. The findings reveal that Price, Reputation, Service Quality, Effective Advertising, Involuntary Switching, Distance, and Switching Costs have an impact on customers&#8217; bank switching behaviour. The results also reveal that the Young Age and High Income Groups are more likely to switch banks. In general, the results of this research allow service marketers and practitioners to develop and implement services marketing strategies to decrease customer defection rates, and in turn, increase bank profits. Furthermore, this research provides useful information for future researchers who study switching-behaviour in the banking industry.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">customer switching behaviour</field><field name="subject">Chinese banking industry</field><field name="subject">logit analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interinstitutional relocation of aged people</field><field name="creator">Stein, Irene Louise</field><field name="description">This purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a forced mass interinstitutional relocation on the quality of life for two groups of nursing home residents. A conceptual model for this study. The Relocation Adaptation Model (RA), was derived from both empirical and conceptual literature on social gerontology.The study population was randomly selected from the more cognitively able nursing home residents. A combination of methodologies was used to collect the data necessary to make comparisons over a 17 week time period. Three recognised instruments were used: the General Health Questionnairre-20, The Affectometer 2 and the Katz Index of Activities Of Daily Living. Other instruments were developed by the researcher to collect relevant data. An audit of participant's records was included. Guided interviews were also carried out. The study found that the quality of life of residents in a nursing home is effected following a forced interinstitutional relocation and that the level of medication useage by participants may have been a significant factor in the response to the relocation.Few mass relocations of nursing home residents have taken place in Australia. These will increase as existing nursing home buildings age and deteriorate. This study is unique.

Conseauently there has been considerable activity and research to provide the engineer with information that will enable him to design bulk solid storage facilities for unobstructed and predictable flow. There also has been an increasing tendency in industry to handle finer materials which has led to considerable difficulties especially in cases where the actual flow rate was considerably less than plant capacities.Such misfortunes have prompted a number of investigations in this field in an endeavour to understand the flow of fine materials and to make suitable modifications to gravity flow bins to improve the flow situation. This thesis is concerned with the prediction of the flow rates of fine bulk solids from mass fLow bins and hoppers. In this initiaL treatment the two-phase nature of the flow will become apparent. The analysis requires the imultaneous consideration of the continuity of the bulk solid and the interstitial fluid,and the inclusion of the effects of the interstitial gas pressure gradients in the equation of motion of the flowing bulk solid.This analysis will be applied ihitially to an incremental element of bulk solid,the flow through which is described by a number of partial differential equations whose solution requires considerable numerical effort. An approximate analysis is then be developed by considering the flow through an assumed element . Three non-linear total differential equdtions result which also require numerical techniques for their solution.By making suitable assumptions for the forni of the flow stress field ,analytical solutions for the flow rate, the interstitial gas pressure distribution and the flow stress field are obtained for channels with or without surcharge. Pesults for coarse bulk solids are then derived by neglecting the effects of interstitial fliud pressure graaients. The predicted flow rates compare favourably with observed flow rates from an experimental pLane flow bin.It must be stressed that this is only an initial treatment, extensive work still is required to completely understand and predict the flow of general bulk solids from bins.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of fluidised dense-phase pneumatic conveying of powders</field><field name="creator">Mallick, Soumya Suddha</field><field name="description">Dense-phase pneumatic conveying of powders is becoming increasingly popular in various industries such as power, pharmaceutical, cement, alumina, chemical, limestone, refinery, and so on. Some of the reasons include: minimum gas flows and power consumption; improved product quality; increased workplace safety. However, due to the highly concentrated and turbulent mode of the solids-gas flow, only limited progress has been be achieved so far in understanding the fundamental transport mechanisms and accurately predicting pipeline pressure drop, which is a key system design parameter. This thesis aims to overcome the present limitations and provide the industry with a new validated modelling procedure for the accurate prediction and scale-up of pressure drop and optimal operating conditions for fluidised dense-phase pneumatic conveying systems.Various popular/existing models (and model formats) for solids friction (for straight horizontal pipes) have been evaluated for scale-up accuracy and stability. It has been found that the models (and their use of parameter groupings) are generally not capable of accurately predicting pressure drop under scale-up conditions of pipeline diameter and/or length. Two new approaches and another method based on the parameters used by other researcher have been employed in this study as improved design techniques. One approach, derived by modifying an existing reliable dilute-phase model to make it suitable for dense-phase, has resulted in a substantial relative improvement in the overall accuracy of  predictions under scale-up conditions for two types of fly ash, ESP dust, pulverised coal and fly ash/cement mixture. Another method has been derived using the concept of &#8220;two-layer&#8221; slurry flow modelling (i.e. suspension flow occurring on top of a non-suspension moving layer), and this has also resulted in similar improvements. The third method, using parameters that were mentioned by another researcher as providing better representation of the flow phenomenon, has also resulted in similar reliable predictions.  Three different popular/existing bend models have been evaluated to select an optimal (bend loss) model for dense-phase powder conveying. It has been found that the estimation of bend pressure drop can have a considerable impact towards correctly predicting the total pressure loss in a pneumatic conveying system.An existing method of representing &#8220;minimum transport criteria&#8221; (based on superficial air velocity and solids loading ratio) has been found inadequate for predicting the unstable boundary, especially under diameter scale-up conditions. Based on the experimental data of various powders conveyed over a wide range of pipe lengths and diameters, it is found that with increase in pipe diameter, the requirement of minimum conveying air velocity increases. To capture the pipe diameter effect, a Froude number based approach has been introduced to reliably represent the minimum transport boundary.The thesis also investigates the suitability of using a direct differential pressure (DP) measurement technique across a straight length of pipe for fine powder conveying in dense-phase. Standard Deviations (SD) of the DP, as well as the static pressure signals are presented. The trend shows the SD values are increasing with increase in pipe length from pipe inlet to exit (i.e. a dependence on tapping location).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions</field><field name="creator">Russell, Benjamin Gallard, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Odour plays an important role in many predator/prey interactions. In the northern hemisphere, many mammalian prey species have been shown to respond to predator odours. It is also widely assumed that mammalian predators utilise odours to locate their prey. This thesis explores the importance of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions. Responses of native Australian species to the faecal odour of two predators; the native tiger quoll Dasyurus maculatus and the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes, were evaluated through live-trapping and focussed behavioural studies of captive animals. Tiger quoll responses to prey olfactory cues were investigated in a captive experiment. Native rodents (bush rats Rattus fuscipes, swamp rats R. lutreolus and eastern chestnut mice Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) equally avoided traps scented with either quoll or fox faeces, and in captive experiments, bush rats and swamp rats reduced their average speed in response to both predator odours. Of the marsupial species, northern brown bandicoots Isoodon macrourus and common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula were captured more frequently in quoll-scented traps than unscented traps or foxscented traps, while captures of brown antechinus Antechinus stuarttii, long-nosed bandicoots Perameles nasuta and southern brown bandicoot I. obesulus were unaffected by the either predator odour. In captive experiments, brown antechinus, long-nosed and northern brown bandicoots decreased their foraging in response to both predator odours, and spent less time in areas scented with quoll faeces. Tiger quolls didn't appear to detect odour sources from a distance of &gt;65 cm, but they did follow scent trails and spent more time in areas scented with the urine and faeces of potential prey. Chemical analysis revealed no common components in fox and quoll odour which prey species could be responding to. Therefore, these native species have evolved to respond to fox odour since foxes were introduced to Australia 130 years ago. The stronger response of native rodents to fox odour may be a legacy of their co-evolution with canid predators prior to entering Australia. A better understanding of how odour is utilised in Australian predator/prey interactions may lead to a greater ability to protect Australia's unique mammalian fauna from introduced predators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Predatory animals - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Spotted-tailed quoll - Ecology - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Red fox - Ecology - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Rodents - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Brown antechinus - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Bandicoots - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Smell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and characterization of multipath fading channels in cellular mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Khan, Noor Muhammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the enormous capacity and performance gains associated with the use of antenna arrays in wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication links, it is inevitable that these technologies will become an integral part of future systems. In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long term housing prices in Australia and some economic perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stapledon, Nigel David, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis constructs, principally from primary sources, a long term time series for house and land prices for Sydney and Melbourne, and house price and rental yield series for Australia. These new series span the period 1880-1965 and give an historical perspective beyond the period from 1970 for which existing house price time series begin for Australia and for most of the world. The price series indicates that the modern experience (i.e. since the 1970s) of a significant upward trend in real prices differs markedly from the experience in the first half of the 20th century when house prices moved very little. The thesis then takes several approaches to explaining the apparent shift in direction in the mid 20th century. The first approach examines house prices in terms of demand and supply variables. Urban theory says that demographic and income factors are critical. However, assessed over this long time span, these demand factors do not offer a satisfactory explanation. Additionally, it is found that there is no cointegrating relationship between prices and income. Rather, it appears that supply factors have probably been the pivotal influence in explaining the shift in direction, consistent with a growing literature which focuses on the role of regulation and other constraints on supply. In Australia???s case, government policies imposing capital contributions on the cost of land appear to be a major factor. The second approach taken is to view housing in terms of asset pricing as more typically applied to the equity market by Campbell and Shiller (1988) and others. A central debate is whether or not there has been a structural fall in the equity yield and given the parallel fall in the house yield, this question is posed for housing. The thesis finds that tax and other factors can explain a structural decline in the housing yield. The house rental yield appears to be a better predictor of future rental growth and a negative predictor of future returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There's always more: the art of David McDiarmid</field><field name="creator">Gray, Sally Suzette Clelland, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the work of the artist David McDiarmid is to be read as an enactment of late twentieth century gay male and queer politics.

Tsuey, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality.  As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted.  The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450-1550 ??C. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ??C for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s-1) = 0.47 to K (x 103 s-1) = 14.7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates.  The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role.  Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ??C was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123-129?? in the initial stages and between 109-114?? after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution.  The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke.  Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates.  The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles.  There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid iron.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Carbon.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss minimization in the modified algorithm of load flow analysis in industrial power system</field><field name="creator">Lukman, Dedek, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research looks at an alternative technique of loss minimization using B-loss formula in solving load flow analysis. A modeling of electrical system elements is first developed. A literature review on the history and development of load flow analysis and loss minimization especially on the use of B-loss formula are delivered. A report on load flow in practice and loss minimization measures based on a utility visit to EnergyAustralia is given. An analysis on three types of industrial power systems is also discussed. A substantial study on EDSA was made to adapt the commercial load flow program and demonstrate voltage control methods to achieve loss minimization. The research thesis work focuses on the use of a load flow analysis program to calculate and minimize losses in large electrical power distribution system such as an industrial power system. A Matlab load flow analysis program has been developed successfully using modified polar Newton-Raphson algorithms based on bus admittance matrix Ybus and the use of B-loss coefficient method. Real power losses are calculated using Blosses coefficients for achieving loss minimization and the technique has been verified with the traditional I2R and/or differential power methods. Modified load flow algorithm is also implemented by applying voltage control methods using either a shunt capacitor or a load tap changing (LTC) transformer. Voltage level is improved whilst minimizing losses. Appropriate modeling of a capacitor and an LTC transformer have been developed proven. A network of a typical meshed secondary selective system of five bus has been chosen and used as the test case. Several case studies with different values of capacitance and tap settings of transformer have been conducted to determine minimum losses. Further sensitivity analysis is carried out by simulating a wide range of load power configurations and line and transformer resistances to verify the robustness of the proposed modified algorithms especially on the use of B-losses algorithm for the chosen network. Results showed that the proposed algorithms ,although less accurate than full I2R calculations, are robust and reliable to achieve loss minimization for various ranges of load and impedance configurations. There is confidence in applying the method to larger systems. This two-year thesis details novel contribution towards loss minimization in power systems by applying B-losses formula into a load flow program, expressing the system losses in terms of active power generations which allows coordination of transmission losses in scheduling output of each generating plant. This gives maximum economy for a given load and achieves loss minimization using voltage control methods. This technique is not possible using standard commercial load flow programs.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scanline calculation of radial influence for image processing</field><field name="creator">Ilbery, Peter William Mitchell, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Efficient methods for the calculation of radial influence are described and applied to two image processing problems, digital halftoning and mixed content image compression. The methods operate recursively on scanlines of image values, spreading intensity from scanline to scanline in  proportions approximating a Cauchy distribution.  For error diffusion halftoning, experiments show that this recursive scanline spreading provides an ideal pattern of distribution of error. Error diffusion using masks generated to provide this distribution of error alleviate error diffusion "worm" artifacts.  The recursive scanline by scanline application of a spreading filter and a complementary filter can be used to reconstruct an image from its horizontal and vertical pixel difference values. When combined with the use of a downsampled image the reconstruction is robust to incomplete and quantized pixel difference data. Such gradient field integration methods are described in detail proceeding from representation of images by gradient values along contours through to a variety of efficient algorithms.  Comparisons show that this form of gradient field integration by convolution provides reduced distortion compared to other high speed gradient integration methods. The reduced distortion can be attributed to success in approximating a radial pattern of influence. An approach to edge-based image compression is proposed using integration of gradient data along edge contours and regularly sampled low resolution image data. This edge-based image compression model is similar to previous sketch based image coding methods but allows a simple and efficient calculation of an edge-based approximation image.  A low complexity implementation of this approach to compression is described. The implementation extracts and represents gradient data along edge contours as pixel differences and calculates an approximate image by performing integration of pixel difference data by scanline convolution. The implementation was developed as a prototype for compression of mixed content image data in printing systems.

In hostile or harsh environments such as enemy territories in battlefields, fire or chemical spills, it is impossible to deploy the sensor nodes in a predeter- mined regular topology to guarantee adequate coverage. Random deployment is thus more practical and feasible for large target areas. On the other hand, random deployment of sensors is highly susceptible to the occurrence of coverage holes in the target area. A potential solution for enhancing the existing coverage achieved by random deployments involves the use of mobility capable sensors that would help fill the coverage holes. This thesis seeks to address the problem of determining the current coverage achieved by the non-deterministic deployment of static sensor nodes and subsequently enhancing the coverage using mobile sensors.  The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of MAPC (Mobility Assisted Probabilistic Coverage), a distributed protocol for ensuring area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks. The primary contribution is a pragmatic approach to sensor coverage and maintenance that we hope would lower the technical barriers to its field deployment. Most of the assumptions made in the MAPC protocol are realistic and implementable in real-life applications e.g., practical boundary estimation, coverage calculations based on a realistic sensing model, and use of movement triggering thresholds based on real radio characteristics etc. The MAPC is a comprehensive three phase protocol. In the first phase, the static sensors calculate the area coverage using the Probabilistic Coverage Algorithm (PCA). This is a deviation from the idealistic assumption used in the binary detection model, wherein a sensor can sense accurately within a well defined (usually circular) region. Static sensors execute the PCA algorithm, in a distributed way, to identify any holes in the coverage. In the second phase, MAPC scheme moves the mobile nodes in an optimal manner to fill these uncovered locations. For different types of initial deployments, the proposed movement algorithms consume only 30-40% of the energy consumed by the basic virtual force algorithm. In addition, this thesis addresses the problem of coverage loss due to damaged and energy depleted nodes. The problem has been formulated as an Integer Linear Program and implementable heuristics are developed that perform close to optimal solutions. By replacing in-operational nodes in phase three, MAPC scheme ensures the continuous operation of the WSN.  Experiments with real mote hardware were conducted to validate the boundary and coverage estimation part of the MAPC protocol. Extensive discrete event simulations (using NS2) were also performed for the complete MAPC protocol and the results demonstrate that MAPC can enhance and maintain the area coverage by efficiently moving mobile sensor nodes to strategic positions in the uncovered area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coverage Issues.</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Markers of nutritional assessment in children with gastrointestinal illnesses</field><field name="creator">Aurangzeb, Brekhna, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  Nutritional status affects every aspect of a child?s health. Thorough nutritional assessment is hampered by the lack of a single comprehensive tool, which can cover all aspects of nutritional assessment. In three distinct studies, this thesis investigated the nutritional status of hospitalised children, children with coeliac disease and children with inflammatory bowel disease. Study 1 The objectives of this study were to assess prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk, and define demographic and anthropometric factors associated with nutritional risk among hospitalized children. In this cross sectional study, 157 hospitalised children were assessed for nutritional status using nutritional risk score (NRS) and anthropometric measurements. We found that 4.5%, 8.9%, 15.1% and 10.4% children were wasted, stunted, overweight and obese respectively. However, with the NRS, 47.8% of the children were at high nutritional risk. These children at high risk had lower weight for age (p=0.02), lower BMI percentiles for age (p=0.001) and longer hospitalization (p=0.001) than children at no risk. Study 2 The objectives of this study were to determine nutritional parameters in children with coeliac disease. Twenty-five children with coeliac disease and an equal number of age and gender matched controls were enrolled and anthropometric measurements, BIA and leptin levels were analysed in all. No significant differences were found between the children with coeliac disease and controls in these parameters. BMI percentile correlated with leptin levels in children with coeliac disease. Study 3 The objectives of this study were to determine anthropometric parameters and leptin levels in children with IBD and ascertain if BMI correlates with leptin levels in these children. Thirty children with IBD and 60 age and gender matched controls were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements and leptin levels were analysed and compared with controls. IBD children had significantly low weight for age (p=0.002), BMI percentiles (p=0.001) and leptin levels (p=0.009) compared to controls. There was a correlation between BMI and leptin levels in IBD children. In conclusion, this thesis has shown that one quarter of hospitalized children were overweight or obese, and further, that half of the hospitalised children were at high risk of nutritional deterioration and these children had longer hospital stay than children at no risk. Children with coeliac disease had similar anthropometric measurements, body compartments and leptin levels to controls. However, children with IBD had lower anthropometric measurements and leptin levels, indicating under-nutrition. Nutritional assessment should be a mandatory part of clinical management with nutritional status assessed by various tools including NRS, anthropometry, BIA and leptin levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutritional assessment.</field><field name="subject">Nutritional risk scores.</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis.</field><field name="subject">Serum leptin.</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry.</field><field name="subject">Coeliac disease.</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) (Macropodidae: Marsupialia) in the Northern Jarrah Forest of Australia</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Matt, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The quokka (Setonix brachyurus Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1830) is a medium-sized, macropodid marsupial that is endemic to the mesic, south-western corner of Australia.  While being a tourist icon on Rottnest Island, the species is threatened with extinction.  It has been intensively studied on Rottnest Island in the 1960s and 1970s, however very little is known of its ecology on the mainland.  Additionally the insular and mainland environments are extremely different suggesting that ecological differences between the two populations are likely.  Consequently, this study sought to determine the basic autecology of the quokka and identify what factors have attributed to its threatened conservation status.  The northern jarrah forest of Western Australia was selected as the study region due to it being at the northern limit of extant quokka distribution and because it was thought that the factors threatening the quokka would be exacerbated there. Fossil deposits suggest that the quokka originally occupied an area of approximately 49,000 km2 in the south-western corner of Australia.  Historical literature show that they were widespread and abundant when Europeans colonised the region in 1829 but a noticeable and dramatic decline occurred a century later.  The arrival of the red fox to the region coincided almost exactly with this decline and so it was probably ultimately responsible.  Continued predation by both it and the feral cat are likely to have continued the decline, along with habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes.  Specific surveys and literature searches show that since the 1950s, the area occupied by the quokka has declined by 45% and since 1990 by 29%.  Based on the criteria of the IUCN (Hilton-Taylor 2000), the conservation status of the quokka should remain as vulnerable.  An endangered status may be more applicable if the quokkas restriction to patches through its existence as a metapopulation is considered. Trapping of eight sites supporting quokka populations in the mid-1990s revealed three sites now locally extinct despite the ongoing, six year old, fox control programme.  Another three are at serious risk of extinction.  Extant population sizes ranged from one to 36 and population density ranged from 0.07 to 4.3 individuals per hectare.  This is considered to be below the carrying capacity of each site. The overall quokka population size in the northern jarrah forest may be as low as 150 adult individuals, of which half are likely to be female.  Even the largest extant populations are highly susceptible to stochastic extinction events.  This small size was surprising considering the six year old, introduced predator control programme. Historically, the restriction to discrete habitat patches, the occasional inter-patch movement, the lack of correlation between the dynamics of each population and reports of frequent localised extinctions and colonisations suggest that the quokka population once existed as part of a classic metapopulation.  The massive decline of the quokka in the 1930s pushed the metapopulation structure into a non-equilibrium state such that today, the extant populations are the terminal remnants of the original classic metapopulation. Wild mainland quokkas breed throughout the year.  A significant reduction in the number of births occurs over summer and this coincides with a decline in female body weight.  Despite this, the mainland quokka is relatively fecund and is able to wean two offspring per year.  The level of recruitment from pouch young to independence was low and this may explain the apparent lack of population increase following the initiation of fox control.  A total of 56 trapped quokkas were fitted with a radio collar.  Mean home range size for quokkas was 6.39 ha with a core range of 1.21 ha and this was negatively related to population density.  Male home ranges were larger than females but not significantly when the sexual size dimorphism was considered.  Nocturnal ranges were larger than diurnal ranges reflecting nocturnal departures from the swamp refugia.  Home range sizes varied seasonally, probably due to changes in the distance required to move to obtain sufficient nutrients and water over the dry summer compared to the wet winter and spring.  Telemetry confirmed trapping results that showed no movement between swamps or populations.  Home range centres shifted to the periphery of the swamp following the winter inundation and this may increase the species susceptibility to predation.  The lack of dispersal is probably caused by quokka populations existing below carrying capacity and following selection for philopatry under the threat of predation for dispersing individuals.  Without dispersal to recolonise or rescue unpopulated patches, the collapse of the original quokka metapopulation appears to have occurred.  On a macrohabitat scale, the quokka in the northern jarrah forest is restricted to Agonis swamp shrubland habitats that form in the open, upper reaches of creek systems on the western side of the forest.  This restriction was probably initially due to the high water requirements of the quokka but is likely to have been exacerbated by increased predation pressure since the arrival of the fox.  On a microhabitat scale, the quokka is a habitat specialist, preferring early seral stage swamp habitats, probably for foraging, as part of a mosaic of old age swamp that provides refuge. Despite the six year old, introduced predator control programme, foxes and cats are still the major cause of mortality to quokkas.  Road kills was the other identifiable cause.  Individuals alive at the start of the study had an 81% chance of staying alive until the end.  The likelihood of dying was minimised by grouping together with conspecifics, maximising home range size and maximising the time spent within the swampy refuge.  Current rates of adult and juvenile survivorship should allow population recovery and so it seems pouch young mortality, reflected by low recruitment, has inhibited the anticipated population increase following predator control. The confounding effect of inadequate unbaited controls meant that little statistical evidence was available on the impact of introduced predators on the quokka, however the models provided support for earlier hypotheses of these.  The presence of a quokka population at a site was related to the amount of poison baits delivered ??? reflecting predation pressure, the average age of the swamp and a mosaic of early and late seral stages within the swamp habitat.  Recently burnt habitat is thought to provide food for quokkas and long unburnt habitat provides refuge from predation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Northern Jarrah Forest Reserve</field><field name="subject">quokka</field><field name="subject">Setonix brachyurus</field><field name="subject">Macropodidae</field><field name="subject">Marsupialia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of offshore gravity from bathymetry</field><field name="creator">Sproule, David, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The definition of the shape of the geoid is a fundamental objective of geodesy, since it allows for the conversion between orthometric and ellipsoidal height systems. The geoid can be computed from gravity values measured over the surface of the earth, and considerable effort continues to achieve a global coverage of gravity values. One technique that has been very successful in recent years in providing gravity coverage in areas which previously have been too difficult to access is airborne gravimetry. This technique has proved very useful in covering near offshore regions, for example. The coastal regions of Australia are recognised as locations where airborne gravimetry has the potential to fill in missing gravity data. A pilot survey using an airborne gravity meter was undertaken off the north east coast of Australia. In areas that remain unsurveyed it is sometimes useful to fill in the missing gravity data values with predicted gravity values. Previous research has examined the possibility of predicting gravity values from other observed quantities. The best success has been achieved by using the gravity effect calculated from bathymetric information. Often the corresponding isostatic compensation is computed, and the combined bathymetric-isostatic gravity effect is used. However, the type and extent of compensation that exists in any particular region mostly remains unknown. Theoretical considerations indicate that the short wavelength part of the gravity field may be adequately modelled by the gravity effect of the bathymetry alone, without reference to an assumed compensation mechanism. With this in mind, a prediction scheme has been developed which utilises the short wavelength gravity field information implied by the bathymetry, combined with the long wavelength gravity field information from existing observed gravity. This scheme allows the prediction of ???fill-in??? gravity values in areas with limited observed gravity. The prediction technique was used on a test set of data off the east coast of Greenland. The prediction technique was seen to outperform a simple interpolation of gravity values by approximately ten percent. Geoid computations performed with the predicted gravity values indicate that the prediction technique can provide significant improvements in computed geoids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioparticle engineering using dense gas technologies</field><field name="creator">Lam, Un Teng, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The applications of dense gas technology (DGT) in modern particle engineering have shown promising results in producing submicron particles with uniform particle morphology.

This view has been supported by a number of researchers who hypothesise that to achieve reductions in transport emissions individuals need to be encouraged to use public transport, and the most appropriate method of increasing public transport use occurs predominately from building residential areas at high densities around public transport nodes.  This notion is integral to recent urban growth management policies in Sydney, which have sought to increase residential densities under the rubric of urban consolidation. There are a number of researchers who have promoted the benefit of increasing urban densities as a way of increasing public transport use.  In Australia, the most cited research in this area is that of Newman and Kenworthy.  Nonetheless, there are a number of commentators who have criticised the emphasis of density in increasing public transport use.  These commentators assert that factors other than density, particularly socio-economic factors, are more important in influencing public transport use.  Nevertheless, a major gap within this concept is that the research is conducted at the macro-level with minimal analysis at the meso or micro level.  This thesis attempts to fill a gap in our knowledge by assessing the relationship between urban density and public transport use, particularly trains, at the macro, meso and micro level.  The analyses used data across the Sydney metropolitan area and by geographical location to assess the implications of the density-public transport debate, and its articulation in urban consolidation policies.  Such an analysis also has implications for other Australian cities who have promoted urban consolidation.  The study concludes that residential density is not as important as socio-economic factors in influencing one form of public transport use, namely trains.  Variables such as car ownership, country of origin, housing tenure, and the type and location of employment are more important in influencing train use than density.  The study concludes that at the macro level the notion of increasing densities increases public transport use is plausible, yet at the micro level the relationship between high density housing and public transport use (in this case train use) is more complex.  This suggests that the promotion of urban consolidation policies as a means to increase public transport use needs to be re-assessed.  Importantly, there is still much research to be conducted to fully comprehend the relationships between housing and transport in order to better inform urban growth management policies in cities, including Sydney.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Residential density</field><field name="subject">Urban consolidation</field><field name="subject">Public transport</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the quality of donor organs for transplantation: studies of hormone resuscitation of the brain-dead multi-organ donor and the development of a long-term preservation strategy to optimise function of the transplanted heart in a porcine model</field><field name="creator">Hing, Alfred , Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Brain death has adverse effects on the organ donor, increasing organ dysfunction and affecting transplantation outcomes. It can also render organs unsuitable for transplantation. Another determinant of organ quality is ischaemia-reperfusion injury, which limits ischaemic storage time for hearts to six hours.  The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effectiveness of hormone resuscitation (HR) of the donor to ameliorate the effects of brain death. Another aim was to develop a donor management and organ preservation strategy to ameliorate the effects of ischaemia-reperfusion injury on the heart, thereby extending ischaemic preservation times. A porcine model of the brain-dead multi-organ donor with orthotopic cardiac transplantation was utilised.  Donor HR was shown to improve cardiac contractility and haemodynamics, thereby reducing inotrope requirements. A follow-up study investigating the effects of three different donor management protocols demonstrated that donor haemodynamics, renal arterial flow and creatinine clearance were superior in HR animals compared with animals treated with noradrenaline or intravenous fluid alone. Noradrenaline was associated with a significant deterioration in pulmonary function (PaO2 and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient) and a decline in donor pH. HR was not associated with any detrimental effects on the lungs, liver or pancreas compared with the other two groups.  Preservation strategies incorporating glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and cariporide, a Na+-H+ exchange inhibitor, were investigated to safely extend cardiac ischaemic preservation times. Pre-treatment with intravenous cariporide prior to heart explantation (donor) and reperfusion of the transplanted heart (recipient) was shown to effectively extend ischaemic time to 14 hours, evidenced by weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. GTN and cariporide-supplemented Celsior, used as a cardioplegic/storage solution, was also effective in extending preservation time to 14 hours, with superior cardiac contractility compared with cariporide pre-treated hearts. Both treatments also ameliorated reperfusion injury, stabilising haemodynamics for up to three hours post-bypass. This thesis has demonstrated the effectiveness of HR to ameliorate the negative effects of donor brain death. It also provides evidence that combined GTN and cariporide-supplemented Celsior improves long-term preservation of the donor heart. These strategies offer the potential to increase the proportion of transplantable organs, to improve donor organ quality, and thereby improve transplantation outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organ Preservation</field><field name="subject">Heart Transplantation</field><field name="subject">Organ Donor Management</field><field name="subject">Hormone Resuscitation</field><field name="subject">Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury</field><field name="subject">Solid Organ Transplantation</field><field name="subject">Cariporide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Olfactory ensheathing cells in a rat model of dorsal root injury</field><field name="creator">Wu, Ann Shang, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rat model of cervical dorsal root injury mimics the avulsion of dorsal roots in humans following brachial plexus injury, a condition that leads to debilitating sensory disturbances and intractable neuropathic pain that is not amenable to repair. This injury disrupts sensory inputs from the dorsal roots to the spinal cord and the damaged axons do not regenerate across the PNS-CNS interface, the dorsal root entry zone. This thesis investigated the role of OECs for repairing DRI-associated neuropathic pain, which has never been previously explored. Chapter 2 of this thesis characterised two DRI models, a partial (2-root) or complete (4-root) deafferentation of the rat forepaw. The 2-root animals developed persistent allodynia and hyperalgesia, whereas in the 4-root DRI, in contrast, reduced sensation (desensitisation) was found within the affected forepaw. The degree of deficits on performing complex, skilled forepaw movements was proportional to the severity of DRI. Sensory control of forepaw movements was permanently abolishes in animals with 4-root DRI. With the goal of repairing DRI-associated neuropathic pain, the efficacy of genetically modified OECs that carry a novel GDNF construct was examined. These modified GDNF-OECs were able to produce GDNF in vitro, however, died rapidly and failed to yield long term GDNF expression after both acute and delayed transplantation into the DRI spinal cord. Unmodified plain OECs were then used. The results show that delayed transplantation of OECs attenuated the development of DRI-associated allodynia and hyperalgesia. Central reorganisations occurred within the dorsal horn following DRI, including reduction in the area of deep dorsal horn, permanent depletion of IB4-labeled axons and restoration of CGRP-labelled afferents in the denervated superficial laminae. The development of neuropathic pain is suggested to be mediated by the aberrant expansion of large myelinated VGLUT1-positive afferents into the superficial laminae, which normally receive nociceptive inputs. The effect of OECs on modulating nociception seems to be mediated by factors other than inhibition of afferent sprouting. In conclusion, the results in this thesis demonstrated the potential effect of OECs for modulating DRI-associated neuropathic pain. This finding could have clinical applicability for resistant pain sequelae resulting from neurotrauma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brachial plexus injury</field><field name="subject">OEC</field><field name="subject">Neuropathic pain</field><field name="subject">Skilled forepaw movements</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume: Astrolabe Park, Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jorstad, Lange B., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spatial and temporal variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume is examined to determine the mechanisms responsible for the observed variation, and to provide an assessment of the implications of this variation with respect to the interpretation of monitoring data, specifically with regards to its application to geochemical modelling. An integrated approach to field investigation was utilised in this study, including sample collection from a network of standard and bundled piezometers, surface and borehole geophysical investigation techniques, and a manometer board for the measurement of hydraulic head in bundled piezometers. Nine groundwater sampling events were conducted over a 12 month period, with sample analyses comprising field measurement of water quality parameters and redox sensitive elements, and laboratory analysis for major and trace elements and stable isotopes (??18O, ??2H, ??13C-DIC, ??15N). The vertical position of the centre of mass of the leachate plume was observed to vary up to 2 metres between monitoring events, and concentrations of key indicator parameters were observed to fluctuate by as much as 160%. The electrical images created by surface resistivity transects along a groundwater flow path between the landfill and a groundwater-fed pond a short distance downgradient suggest a plume configuration characterised by discrete pulses of concentrated leachate migrating in a conservative manner between the landfill and the pond. It is hypothesized that these leachate slugs are flushed into the aquifer during sustained periods of rainfall, presumed to be a significant driver of leachate mobilisation into the underlying aquifer. The most significant hydrogeochemical processes affecting contaminant mobilisation, transport and attenuation in the leachate-impacted shallow aquifer included microbial degradation of organic waste, dissolution of inorganic waste, ion exchange, precipitation of sulfide and carbonate minerals, mixing with rainfall recharge along flow path, and redox transformations along the plume fringe. These processes are supported by hydrogeochemical data analysis, and generally agree with the results of inverse geochemical modelling. While analysis of detailed groundwater monitoring appears to provide a plausible description of the plume dynamics, the results of the electrical resistivity transects indicates a more varied and complex plume configuration than is suggested by the borehole data alone. This integration of investigation techniques underscores the inherent inadequacy of even a high-resolution monitoring well network to accurately describe the full extent of variation in time and space within a contaminant plume, even in a relatively simple aquifer environment, and accentuates the potentially significant limitations of site-scale hydrogeochemical interpretation based solely on borehole monitoring data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">plumes (Fluid dynamics).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the problem of individuation: Mitsein (being-with), ethics and responsibility</field><field name="creator">Sorial, Sarah, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The argument of this thesis is that Heideggerian individuation does not constitute another form of solipsism and is not incongruent with Heidegger???s account of Mitsein (beingwith). By demonstrating how individuation is bound up with Mitsein I will also argue that this concept of individuation contains an ethics, conceived here as responsibility for one???s Being/existence that nevertheless implicates others. By tracing the trajectory of Heidegger???s thinking from Being and Time to the later text, Time and Being, I want to suggest that the meditation on Being and its relation to Dasein as an individual contains an ethical moment. Ethics, not conceived of as a series of proscriptions, in terms of the Kantian Categorical Imperative for example. Nor ethics conceived in terms of an obligation to and responsibility for another, as in Levinasian ethics, but an ethics in terms of responsibility for existence, and more specifically, for one???s own existence. The ethical moment in Heidegger, I argue, is not one as ambitious as changing the world or assuming infinite and numerous obligations on behalf of others. It is, rather, a question of changing oneself. It is a question of assuming responsibility in response to the call of Being. I will show how, given that Dasein is always Mitsein, others are situated in such an ethics. Central to the thesis is an examination of the relation between indivduation and Mitsein. While Heidegger is always careful to distinguish his form of individuation from other accounts of individuation or solipsism, such as those of Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant or Edmund Husserl???s, Heidegger???s conception of solipsism and its relation to his account  of Mitsein remains somewhat obscure. As a consequence, there are several problems that this concept raises, all of which have been the subject of much debate. At the centre of this debate is the apparent tension between the concept of individuation and the notion that ontologically, Dasein is also a Mitsein. This tension has led to a number of interpretations, which either argue that the concept of individuation is inconsistent with the notion of Mitsein, or that it constitutes yet another instance of Cartesian subjectivity and that as a consequence, it is inherently unethical. This thesis contributes to this debate by submitting that the concept of individuation, while primary or central to Heidegger???s ontology, is not in tension with his account of Mitsein. I use Jean-Luc Nancy???s paradoxical logic of the singular to argue for this claim. I suggest that it is precisely this concept of individuation that can inform an ethics and theory of political action on account of the emphasis on individual responsibility. The second part of my argument, also made with the aid of Nancy, is that this can inform an ethics and a theory of political action, not at level of making moral judgements, or yielding standards of right and wrong, but at the level of individual and by implication, collective responsibility for one???s own existence. Given that there is no real separation between the ontic and ontological levels in Heidegger???s work, a taking responsibility at the level of one???s own Being will invariably play itself out ontically in factical life in terms of moral responsibility and judgement. I explore the concrete political implications of this through an examination of Heidegger???s account of freedom. I argue that Heidegger???s removal of freedom from the  ontology of self-presence and his alternative conception of it provides us with a way of thinking freedom not in terms of a specific set of rights, but as a mode of being-in-theworld and as the basis for collective political action. I use the work of Hannah Arendt to develop a theory of political action, freedom and judgment from this revisionary conception of freedom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silica-on-silicon lightwave circuits based on multimode interference for optical communications</field><field name="creator">Jin, Zhe, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommuncations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses the design and fabrication of silica-on-silicon multimode interference (MMI) devices for optical communications. Firstly, the relationship between different kinds of multimode interference was established for the first time. This gives a clearer understanding of the multimode interference and helps to design better performance optical MMI devices With the consideration of weak lateral light confinement, different kinds of novel approaches to designing high performance MMI devices are developed. The first new approach is for optimization of   silica-on-silicon MMI couplers. It is shown that the length of the multimode section can be varied in a well-defined range to find optimal device performance. The range is linked to the propagation constant spacing of fundamental and higher order modes of the multimode waveguide. The second approach is to introduce a new criterion for designing a   MMI coupler with central input. According to overlapping interference analysis, one image space should be left for the adjacent output waveguides because of the lateral distribution of alternatively vanishing and non-vanishing images.  This consideration is neglected in previous work and is shown to be important for achieving good uniformity MMI power splitters.  Thirdly, a new design of silica-on-silicon multimode interference (MMI) device is proposed. Deeply etched air trenches define the boundaries of the multimode section to achieve strong lateral confinement, resulting in lower loss and imbalance. The access waveguides, however, are buried channel and square core, giving low fibre insertion loss and low polarization dependence. The novel design balanced requirement of the strong lateral confinement of the field in the multimode waveguides and the matching between the fiber and the access waveguides.  Then a new approach of designing silica-on-silicon optical switches based on cascaded MMI couplers is presented. The approach combines the transfer matrix method, optimisation of the MMI dimensions, and mode propagation analysis (MPA) for calculation of phase shifts. The feasibility of the large port count switches is also discussed. It is shown that the good performance devices can be realized with a large port count of 32.  Finally MMI couplers based on silica-on-silicon optical waveguides were fabricated. The Ge-doped silica waveguides were fabricated by HC-PECVD and RIE. Fabrication processes such as thin film deposition and etching are discussed. Good performance devices have been realized.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical communications</field><field name="subject">Optical wave guides</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of factors influencing Bruneian secondary teachers' use of information and communication technology in teaching: a survey exploration</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Sallimah Hj. Mohd.</field><field name="description">Examining teachers' attitudes/perceptions and their influence on behaviour can be an important step in understanding the psychosocial factors affecting teachers' use of Information and Communication Technology in teaching. This study attempted to provide such an understanding by elaborating Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour (TPB), a widely applied psychosocial theory in modeling behaviours. Basically, TPB explains a behaviour as a consequence of attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. These three direct factors of TPB are, in turn, influenced by salient beliefs or indirect factors: behavioural, normative, and control beliefs, respectively. In this study, the TPB was modified by (1) decomposing each of the three types of beliefs into two dimensions respectively, and (2) incorporating external variables &#8211; age, sex, subject taught, teaching experience, teaching period, qualification, level of class, classroom access, and computer laboratory access. Using these predictor variables, an Information and Communication Technology Use Model (ICTUM) was developed for assessment and comparison in performance with the TPB. Using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from a total of 1,040 secondary school teachers in eighteen government schools in Negara Brunei Darussalam. Structural equation modeling, using AMOS 5.0 software, was employed as the major statistical analytic technique for a series of data analyses: measurement model assessment for validity and reliability tests; and assessments of the models, ICTUM and TPB. The proposed model, ICTUM, was found to fit only marginally and the modification efforts through beliefs decomposition and external variables incorporation provided only a small increase in the amounts of variance explained by the predictor variables. However, the TPB model of direct factors was found to be a good-fitting model showing attitude towards behaviour, and perceived behavioural control; as predictors of intention; and intention as a stronger predictor of use of ICT than perceived behavioural control. By demonstrating the significance of those factors as predictors of intention and use of ICT, this study suggests that augmenting teachers' positive attitudes towards the use of ICT and supporting them technically and personally could encourage teachers to increase the use of ICT in their teaching. This study also suggested a need for future research on the direct influence of salient beliefs on intention, and behaviour (use of ICT) respectively. Although the TPB model is theoretically and statistically justifiable, further testing with different samples is required. Through its use of a theoretical and statistical modeling approach, the current study represents an initial step towards uncovering fundamental mechanisms that explain teacher use of ICT in teaching.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">Brunei</field><field name="subject">information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">Ajzen's theory</field><field name="subject">demographic</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001505/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The AtMRS2 gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Revel Scott MacGregor</field><field name="description">Magnesium (Mg2+) is an essential mineral nutrient for plants and is the most abundant free divalent cation in plant cells. However, our knowledge of the role of this ion in the plant cell is limited, and the mechanisms of homeostasis and transport of the ion are almost completely unknown. A. Tutone (this laboratory) identified an Arabidopsis thaliana gene by the complementation of a Mg2+-uptake yeast mutant (CM66). This gene, referred to as AtMRS2-11, was expressed as cDNA from a strong yeast promoter and allowed the growth of the CM66 yeast strain on standard media. The conceptually translated AtMRS2-11 protein sequence was used in this study to identify nine additional proteins by sequence homology searches using the BLAST algorithm. The corresponding genes have been cloned from cDNA (A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta) and sequenced. Protein sequence similarity suggests that the family forms a sub-section of the CorA super-family of Mg2+ transport proteins. The mutant yeast used to identify the family initially was also used to show that two family members in addition to AtMRS2-11 were able to complement the Mg2+-dependent growth phenotype. When fused to eGFP, these proteins showed a localisation consistent with some of the protein reaching the yeast cell membrane. The other members of the family were also fused to eGFP and showed a range of localisation patterns within the yeast cell. None of the three AtMRS2 proteins previously able to complement the yeast mutant phenotype did so when fused to eGFP. RNA transcripts from the AtMRS2 family were detected by RT-PCR in organ-scale preparations of total RNA from A. thaliana. Most family members were detected in all of the organs tested. Northern analysis of AtMRS2-11 RNA transcript level showed that the gene was more highly expressed in leaf tissue, but was not affected by decreased levels of Mg2+ in the growth media. The levels of steady state AtMRS2-11 mRNA transcript were elevated two-fold in the light during the diurnal cycle, but no change was detected during light-induced greening of etiolated seedlings. A stable transgenic A. thaliana line expressing the gusA gene from the promoter region of AtMRS2-11 was used to localise the promoter's activity to cells containing chloroplasts. The expression appeared highest in younger cells. VI The AtMRS2-11 protein was predicted to contain a chloroplast targeting peptide. Western analysis demonstrated that AtMRS2-11 was enriched in the total proteins of isolated chloroplasts as compared to extracts from whole plants. The AtMRS2-11:eGFP fusion protein was also detected in chloroplasts by fluorescence microscopy. Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy was used in conjunction with isolated chloroplasts to try to determine the effects of the overaccumulation of the AtMRS2-11 protein in a transgenic A. thaliana plant line (constructed by A. Tutone). A rapid uptake or binding of Mg2+ was seen in chloroplasts isolated from both wild type and transgenic lines, but no differences were observed in either the rate of Mg2+ uptake/binding or the final Mg2+ content.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biology, Plant Physiology (0817)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Napier&#8217;s mathematical works</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, William Francis</field><field name="description">John Napier, born at Merchiston in 1550, published The Whole Revelation of St. John in 1594; and he appears to have regarded that theological polemic as his most important achievement. Napier's invention of logarithms (with greatly advanced spherical trigonometry) was published in 1614 as Descriptio Canonis Logarithmorum; whereupon the mathematicians of Europe instantly acclaimed Napier as the greatest of them all. In 1617 he published Rabdologiae, which explained several devices for aiding calculation: (1) numbering rods to aid multiplication (known as 'Napier's bones'); (2) other rods to aid evaluation of square and cube roots; (3) the first publication of binary arithmetic, as far as square root extraction; and (4) the Promptuary for multiplication of numbers (up to 10 digits each), which has a strong claim to be regarded as the first calculating machine. Napier's explanation of the construction of his logarithms was published posthumously in 1619 as Constructio Canonis Logarithmorum, in which he developed much of the differential calculus in order to define his logarithms as the solution of a differential equation and then constructed strict upper and lower bounds for the solution. His incomplete manuscript on arithmetic and algebra (written in the early 1590s) was published in 1839 as De Arte Logistica.    This thesis provides the first English translations of De Arte Logistica and of Rabdologiae, and it reprints Edward Wright's English translation (1616) of the Descriptio and W. R. Macdonald's English translation (1889) of the Constructio. Extensive commentaries are given on Napier's work on arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. The history of trigonometry is traced from ancient Babylonia and Greece through mediaeval Islam to Renaissance Europe. Napier's logarithms (and spherical trigonometry) resulted in an explosion of logarithms over most of the world, with European ships using logarithms for navigation as far as Japan by 1640.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MATHEMATICS (0405)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY OF SCIENCE (0585)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species identity, genetic diversity, and molecular systematic relationships among the Ziphiidae (beaked whales)</field><field name="creator">Dalebout, Merel Louise</field><field name="description">Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are one of the least known of all mammalian groups. The majority of species have been described from only a handful of specimens. Found in deep ocean waters, these species are widespread and often sexually dimorphic. Little is known of intra-specific variation in morphology, and many species are very similar in external appearance. A reference database of mitochondrial DNA sequences was compiled for all 20 recognised ziphiid species to aid in species identification. All reference sequences were derived from validated specimens, which were often represented only by bone or teeth. DNA was obtained from this &#8216;historic&#8217; material using &#8216;ancient&#8217; DNA methods. For three species, holotypes were sampled. Phylogenetic analyses using this database led to the discovery of a new, previously unrecognised species of beaked whale (Mesoplodon perrini), new specimens of Longman's beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus), a species known previously from only two partial skulls and the synonymy of a third (M. traversii = M. bahamondi).    Phylogenetic reconstructions based on sequence data from three mitochondrial and two nuclear loci (total, 2815 bp) using neighbour joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods, resolved many of the sister-species relationships in this group. Inferred relationships among Mesoplodon beaked whales indicated that cranial and tooth morphology may be far more variable between closely related species than previously assumed. No support was found for a linear-progression of tooth form as suggested by Moore (1968) in his phenetic evaluation of relationships among the Ziphiidae. The geographic distribution of Mesoplodon species with similar or divergent tooth morphology is likely due to a combination of sexual selection and selection for species recognition. Both hypotheses predict similar patterns, such as dissimilar tooth morphology among species with sympatric or parapatric distributions. However, only sexual selection appears to offer an explanation for why there are so many Mesoplodon beaked whales.    Investigation of mtDNA diversity among a number of beaked whale species indicated that nucleotide diversity was generally lower in this group than in other wide-ranging oceanic cetaceans. The cause of this low diversity was not clear but may be indicative of overall low abundance. Particularly low levels of diversity were found in Baird's beaked whale Berardius bairdii , Arnoux's beaked whale B. arnuxii and the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus. Strong geographic structure in haplotype frequencies was observed among a worldwide sample of Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, GENETICS (0369)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, ZOOLOGY (0472)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective change in adult students in second chance mathematics courses : three different teaching approaches</field><field name="creator">Miller-Reilly, Barbara Joy</field><field name="description">A case study approach was used to explore second-chance mathematics through two larger courses and one individual study program. A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability and bifurcation of deterministic infectious disease models</field><field name="creator">Korobeinikov, Andrei</field><field name="description">Autonomous deterministic epidemiological models are known to be asymptotically stable. Asymptotic stability of these models contradicts observations. In this thesis we consider some factors which were suggested as able to destabilise the system. We consider discrete-time and continuous-time autonomous epidemiological models. We try to keep our models as simple as possible and investigate the impact of different factors on the system behaviour. Global methods of dynamical systems theory, especially the theory of bifurcations and the direct Lyapunov method are the main tools of our analysis.    Lyapunov functions for a range of classical epidemiological models are introduced. The direct Lyapunov method allows us to establish their boundedness and asymptotic stability. It also helps investigate the impact of such factors as susceptibles' mortality, horizontal and vertical transmission and immunity failure on the global behaviour of the system. The Lyapunov functions appear to be useful for more complicated epidemiological models as well.    The impact of mass vaccination on the system is also considered. The discrete-time model introduced here enables us to solve a practical problem-to estimate the rate of immunity failure for pertussis in New Zealand.    It has been suggested by a number of authors that a non-linear dependence of disease transmission on the numbers of infectives and susceptibles can reverse the stability of the system. However it is shown in this thesis that under biologically plausible constraints the non-linear transmission is unable to destabilise the system. The main constraint is a condition that disease transmission must be a concave function with respect to the number of infectives. This result is valid for both the discrete-time and the continuous-time models.    We also consider the impact of mortality associated with a disease. This factor has never before been considered systematically. We indicate mechanisms through which the disease-induced mortality can affect the system and show that the disease-induced mortality is a destabilising factor and is able to reverse the system stability. However the critical level of mortality which is necessary to reverse the system stability exceeds the mortality expectation for the majority of human infections. Nevertheless the disease-induced mortality is an important factor for understanding animal diseases.    It appears that in the case of autonomous systems there is no single factor able to cause the recurrent outbreaks of epidemics of such magnitudes as have been observed. It is most likely that in reality they are caused by a combination of factors.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's agency in the North Shore and Waitakere cities of Auckland (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Billot, Jennie Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which women assess and seek resources in their urban contexts. I argue that the struggles of daily life in local communities and institutional groups can produce ideological spaces into which new practices, arising from increased consciousness of issues, can be developed.    My aim has been to uncover women's experiences in a way that not only interprets meanings from their practices, but also encourages such practices to be seen as valid renderings of women's understandings. I examine women's initiatives through the analysis of varying contexts. While I acknowledge the historical importance of the domestic situation as a threshold for much historic activism, women's proactivity requires a broader situational analysis. I therefore present cases of proactivity within the domestic, public and business spheres, within the two cities of Waitakere and North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand.    Through the search for new progressive social identities, women's activities at the inter-personal level are a prime source of social change. It is through the recursive relationship between women as agents and the social structure, that changing interpretations of social expectations are produced, allowing for creative activism. While women's initiatives may aim to transform particular social environments, they become part of the incremental process of change that alters the experience and structure of women's lives.    The thesis has four parts. The first outlines the scope, objectives and theoretical framework, while the second conceptualises women's agency and its positioning within social gendered structures. Part Three presents the investigative processes linking the theoretical framework and the empirical analysis. Part Four submits the thematic interpretations of the thesis, concluding that women can be agents of social change in a diversity of ways.    I acknowledge my feminist stance, one with layerings of objectives and motivations. I view women's circumstances as resulting from the interweaving of structural forces and personal capacities. The resulting awareness of women's experiences can challenge the values and concepts of masculine discourses. This is viewed through the concept of multiplicity. On a political level this means creating a resistance to hierarchies and a commitment to a plurality of voice, style and structure.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GEOGRAPHY (0366)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">WOMEN'S STUDIES (0453)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for analysis of epidemiological data using capture-recapture methods</field><field name="creator">Huakau, John Tupou</field><field name="description">Capture-recapture methods take their origins from animal abundance estimation, where they were used to estimate the unknown size of the animal population under study. In the late 1940s and again in the late 1960s and early 1970s these same capture-recapture methods were modified and applied to epidemiological list data. Since then through their continued use, in particular in the 1990s, these methods have become popular for the estimation of the completeness of disease registries and for the estimation of the unknown total size of human disease populations.    In this thesis we investigate new methods for the analysis of epidemiological list data using capture-recapture methods. In particular we compare two standard methods used to estimate the unknown total population size, and examine new methods which incorporate list mismatch errors and model-selection uncertainty into the process for the estimation of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. We study the use of modified tag loss methods from animal abundance estimation to allow for list mismatch errors in the epidemio-logical list data. We also explore the use of a weighted average method, the use of Bootstrap methods, and the use of a Bayesian model averaging method for incorporating model-selection uncertainty into the estimate of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. In addition we use two previously unanalysed Diabetes studies to illustrate the methods examined and a well-known Spina Bifida Study for simulation purposes.    This thesis finds that ignoring list mismatch errors will lead to biased estimates of the unknown total population size and that the list mismatch methods considered here result in a useful adjustment. The adjustment also approximately agrees with the results obtained using a complex matching algorithm. As for the incorporation of model-selection uncertainty, we find that confidence intervals which incorporate model-selection uncertainty are wider and more appropriate than confidence intervals that do not. Hence we recommend the use of tag loss methods to adjust for list mismatch errors and the use of methods that incorporate model-selection uncertainty into both point and interval estimates of the unknown total population size.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MATHEMATICS (0405)</field><field name="subject">STATISTICS (0463)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS (0308)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to electron spin resonance dating, with special reference to speleothems</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Ruth Gladwyn Amy</field><field name="description">Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating has many potential applications in the fields of archaeology and Quaternary geomorphology. In particular, it offers a useful addition to more established techniques for dating speleothems, which not only have relevance to Quaternary geomorphology but may also carry palaeomagnetic and palaeoclimatic data. This work consolidates the method of ESR dating, with special reference to calcite speleothems, and contributes to several important aspects of the methodology. Using a low energy nuclear accelerator as a source of alpha particles of various energies, it is shown that the effectiveness of alpha radiation in producing paramagnetic defects is energy dependent, and approximately linearly related to the range of the incident alpha; the implications for dose rate calculations are discussed, and ranges are calculated for alpha particles of different energies for various dating materials for use in applying the above finding. The alpha/gamma effectiveness ratio, k, is experimentally determined for 18 calcite speleothems as k$/sb[/rm av]$ = 0.052 $/pm$ 0.006, which is significantly less than most previous estimates. The k-value for a coral sample is 0.055. By examining the Th-230/Po-210 ratios of 19 speleothem samples it is shown that for almost all speleothems, radon is retained within the sample until its decay; thus the full radionuclide decay chains should be used in dose rate calculations. Analysis of 'typical' calcite spectra confirms that interference between peaks of different origins and stability affects the estimate of accumulated dose (AD), and provides a rational basis for decisions on different sample preparation methods and analytical procedures. The effect of these on age estimates is examined and routine experimental methods recommended. The effect of different ESR spectrometer operating parameters is also evaluated and it is shown that the use of high microwave power avoids potentially serious underestimation of the accumulated dose (AD). A straight-forward statistical method is developed; this enables confidence limits to be derived for AD and provides a test for equivalence of AD estimates, using standard linear hypothesis techniques. A robust Geiger Muller instrument sufficiently sensitive to give estimates of relative gamma dose rates in a few minutes is developed specifically for cave dosimetry. It has the potential, with further development and cross-calibration, to become a viable method for measuring absolute environmental gamma dose rates. Serious discrepancies between two 'absolute' dosimetry methods are revealed; this and other problems of environmental gamma dosimetry are discussed. The evaluation of gamma dose rates in calcite (with respect to both laboratory and field dosimetry) and the form of the dose response curve (including the possibility of supra-linearity and non-thermal instability) are identified as areas requiring further research.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY (0368)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand Greywackes:  A study of geological concepts in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Heather Halcrow</field><field name="description">This thesis traces changes in geological concepts associated with the New Zealand greywackes. Since mineralogists adopted the German mining term 'grauwacke' in the 1780s to refer to a type of old, hard, grey, muddy sandstone, both the name and the rock have caused confusion and controversy. English geologists in the 1830s used the term 'grauwacke' as a rock name and a formation name for their most ancient rocks. The English abandoned the name, but 'greywacke' remained useful in Scotland and began to be used in New Zealand in the 1890s. New Zealanders still refer to the association of semi-metamorphosed greywacke sandstones, argillites, minor lavas, cherts and limestone constituting the North Island ranges and the Southern Alps as 'the greywackes'. With the South Island schists, the greywackes make up 27% of the surface of the New Zealand landmass. They supply much of our road metal, but otherwise have little economic importance. Work on these basement rocks has rarely exceeded 10% of geological research in New Zealand.Leading geologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries competed to construct stratigraphical models for New Zealand where the greywackes were usually classified as of Paleozoic age. Controversy was generated by insufficient data, field mistakes, wrong fossil identifications, attachment to ruling theories and the inability of European-based conventional stratigraphical methodologies to deal with these Carboniferous to Jurassic rocks formed in a very different and unsuspected geological environment. After 1945, growth of the universities, increased Geological Survey activity, and the acquisition of more reliable data led to fresh explanatory ideas about geosynclines, turbidity currents, depositional facies, low-grade metamorphism, and structural geology. New interest in the greywackes resulted in the accumulation of additional knowledge about their paleontology, petrography, sedimentology and structure. Much of this geological data is stored in visual materials including maps, photographs, and diagrams and these are essential today for the interpretation and transfer of information.The development of plate tectonic theory and the accompanying terrane concept in the seventies and eighties permitted real progress in understanding the oceanic origin of greywackes within submarine accretionary prisms and their transport to the New Zealand region. In the last half century comparatively little geological controversy about the greywackes has taken place because of the acquisition of quantities of data, technological improvements, and the use of a dependable theory of the Earth's crust. Scientific controversy takes place when data and/or background theory is inadequate.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology (0372)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluid-mineral equilibria in the Kawerau hydrothermal system, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Christenson, Bruce William</field><field name="description">The Kawerau hydrothermal system lies at the northern end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, on the some 20 km south of the Bay of Plenty. The system, which is thought to have been active for at least 200,000 years, is situated over an area which has been volcanically active through time. Relatively recent local magmatism is found in the 800 m high, 3000-10,000 year old Mt. Edgecumbe dacite massif and the 200 m high Onepu Dome complex which lie adjacent to and within, respectively, the present day resistivity anomaly.    Shallow reservoir fluids show evidence of steam heating as expressed by elevated bicarbonate and/or sulphate contents and mildly to strongly acidic pH, whereas the deep fluids are dominantly alkaline at their respective temperatures. The calculated base fluid composition is comprised of 2.5 wt% CO$/sb2$ and ca. 890 mg/kg Cl at 310$/sp/circ$C.    Fluid inclusion studies show a largely stable, boiling point thermal regime through time, whereas oxygen stable isotope studies on hydrothermal carbonates prove the existence of one or more pulses of isotopically heavy fluids into the reservoir at some time(s) in the past. Hydrothermal alteration associated with these isotopic anomalies indicate strongly oxidising conditions relative to both alteration elsewhere in the reservoir and the present day reservoir redox conditions. Collectively, the data suggest a magmatic source for these transient, isotopically heavy fluids.    The present day system is ore forming, as evident from both metal rich scales formed in the production silencers of the geothermal wells and open fracture reservoir mineralogy. Stockwork environments in the deep reservoir are host to both base and precious metals, and evidence indicates that boiling is the main depositional mechanism for these ore phases.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GEOCHEMISTRY (0996)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/94</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic sampling in ecology</field><field name="creator">Pawley, Matthew David McDonald</field><field name="description">Random start systematic sampling (SYS) is a survey design that is simple (it selects the whole sample with one random start), easy to implement and that can, in theory, give precise estimates of ecological abundance in the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation. However, SYS suffers from a serious defect, namely, that it is not possible to obtain an unbiased estimator of sampling variance (&#952;SYS) on the basis of a single sample. A variety of approximations have been suggested, and unbiased modelbased methods have been calculated, but validation of these estimators has been limited within the ecological literature. The heart of any spatial problem is how to deal with spatial autocorrelation. We show that the scale of spatial inference gives a framework that unifies the commonly reported, discordant views about autocorrelation (i.e. &#8216;autocorrelation increases the power of the analysis&#8217; vs &#8216;autocorrelation decreases the power of the analysis&#8217;). The scale of spatial inference is rarely discussed or considered, but we suggest that it should be the first step in any (spatial) analysis. The thesis then uses computer simulation to compare the performance of eleven previously proposed SYS estimators (including simple random sampling, 4SRS). The computer simulations are designed to recreate the spatial distribution characteristics that are common within ecological abundances. We also develop and test a novel method of estimating &#952;SYS based on &#8216;Krige&#8217;s Additivity Relationship&#8217; and variography (geostatistics). This estimator was labelled 4KAR. We found that if the right spatial model (i.e. a reference theoretical variogram) is used, then 4KAR appears to be an unbiased estimator of &#952;. Without a priori knowledge about the spatial structure (so the theoretical variogram is constructed solely from SYS data), 4KAR was generally one of the least biased and most stable estimators out of those examined. The other estimator that fared well, 4r1, was also model-based; it used an estimate of the first order autocorrelation in its estimate of &#952;. 4SRS performed comparatively well on untransformed ecological simulations, but was the worst performing estimator after a log(x+1) transformation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fauna and Biostratigraphy of the Jurassic Latady Formation, Antarctic Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Hikuroa, Daniel Carl Henare</field><field name="description">The Latady Formation is a suite of Middle to Late Jurassic (170 &#8211; 140 Ma) sedimentary rocks situated in the southeastern region of the Antarctic Peninsula near where the break-up of Gondwana probably began. Latady Formation strata comprise a ~2.8 km thick sequence of black and grey shale and siltstone, light brown sandstone, with subordinate conglomerate and sparse thin limestone and coal that accumulated in a back-arc position in the &#8216;Bay of Antarctica&#8217;. The sediments record terrestrial through to distal-shelf environments and are abundantly fossiliferous in places. Substantial paleontological collections of ~3300 specimens from 219 localities were made during a British Antarctic Survey deep field expedition to the Orville Coast in the 1999/2000 field season. The majority of fossils in the Latady Formation are poorly preserved internal and external moulds. Such material makes taxonomic description difficult. Nevertheless, a diverse, entirely marine fauna comprising 177 taxa (7 phyla, 93 genera) is recorded, dominated by marine invertebrates, predominantly bivalves, but also cephalopods, brachiopods, echinoderms, annelids, an arthropod, and a solitary coral. Vertebrates constitute a minor component (4 specimens), consisting of at least two, possibly three, species of fish and the second marine reptile recorded from the Antarctic Peninsula. 15 new species are described (but not named) in the following genera: &#8216;Paracerithium&#8217;, Lopatinia (s.l.), Modiolus, Pinna, Retroceramus, Oxytoma, Meleagrinella, Camptonectes (Camptochlamys), Myophorella (Scaphogonia), Vaugonia (3 species), Pronoella, Goniomya, and Pentacrinites, and there are a further 21 species too poorly preserved for description but likely to be new. Fifteen distinct faunal assemblages are recognised and named after the dominant species: Retroceramus cf. stehni, R. sp. C ?cf. galoi, Meleagrinella n. sp, Pterotrigonia thomsoni, Entolium spedeni, Neocrassina marwicki, N. ellsworthensis, Flabellirhynchia australensis, Pleuromya spp., Chariocrinus latadiensis, &#8216;Paracerithium&#8217; n. sp., Malayomaorica malayomaorica, M. occidentalis, Retroceramus sp. indet. D., and Blanfordiceras cf. wallichi. These characterise environments ranging from sublittoral to distal-shelf. Collectively, the fauna, taphonomic signatures, assemblages, sediments, and sedimentary structures record an increase in depth from inner- to mid-shelf settings in the Bajocian, through outer-mid shelf during the Kimmeridgian, to outer-shelf depths in the Tithonian. Hence, a general trend of decreasing energy and increasing depth through time is observed. Bathonian and Callovian strata are recognised for the first time in the Latady Formation and the presence of strata of Bajocian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and Tithonian age is further verified. Generic affinities of the fauna are Tethyan (e.g. aff. Cyathophylliopsis, Lopatinia, Oxytoma, Camptonectes, Pronoella, Anisocardia, Teloceras, Normannites, Perisphinctes, Cycleryon, Chariocrinus, Pentacrinites), whereas at specific level they are with coeval New Zealand faunas (e.g. Pinna n. sp, P. kawhiana, Oxytoma trechmanni, O. n. sp., Aucklandirhynchia cf. aucklandica, &#8216;Paracerithium&#8217; n. sp., Hibolithes aff. catlinensis, Belemnopsis aff. deborahae). South American affinities are also shown by the presence of Retroceramus cf. stehni, Pachysphinctes aff. americanensis, and Aspidoceras aff. euomphalum. Two influxes of Tethyan fauna to the &#8216;Bay of Antarctica&#8217; occurred in the Bajocian (e.g. Grammatodon sp., Oxytoma trechmanni, O. n. sp., Camptonectes grandis) and Callovian (e.g. aff. Cyathophylliopsis delabechei, Cucullaea (Idonearca) sp., Camptonectes auritus, Mesosaccella sp., Pronoella spp.) most likely through the Trans-Ethyraean Seaway. The migration route was a short-lived epicontinental seaway formed during transgressions. Apart from the migration of Tethyan taxa, no other evidence of eustatic cycle influence is seen in Latady sediments and the dominant control of relative sea-level was local tectonism. The widespread cephalopod-byssate bivalve biofacies occurs later in the Latady Formation than in other southern Gondwanan sequences, but once established dominates the entire Late Jurassic. Typical constituents of the biofacies present in the Latady Formation include Retroceramus n. sp. A., R. aff. galoi, R. sp. B ?cf. galoi, R. spp. indet. D, E, F, Malayomaorica malayomaorica, M. occidentalis, Hibolithes spp., Belemnopsis spp., Pachyduvalia spp., Pachysphinctes spp., Torquatisphinctes spp., Virgatosphinctes spp., and Kossmatia spp. Individual horizons change from bivalve dominated in the Kimmeridgian &#8211; Middle Tithonian to ammonite dominated in the latest Tithonian.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ascidians and sea hares: rich sources of Bioactive Natural Products</field><field name="creator">Appleton, David</field><field name="description">A survey of the metabolite content of fifty-two ascidians collected from New Zealand and Antarctica is presented. Using biological assays and reversed phase analytical C18 HPLC techniques, twenty-three specimens were selected for further work. Work on ten of the selected ascidians is presented in this study. Using standard chromatographic techniques combined with analytical C18 HPLC, eighteen metabolites were isolated of which sixteen exhibited biological activity. Ten of the eighteen metabolites were novel, with nine exhibiting biological activity. The New Zealand endemic ascidian Pycnoclavella kottae, collected from the Three Kings Islands yielded the novel 2,2,5-trisubstituted imidazol-4-ones, kottamides A - D (3.1 - 3.4). Three new pyridoacridines (4.80, 4.82, 4.84), along with two known pyridoacridines and the known benzopentathiepin, varacin were isolated from the New Zealand endemic ascidian Lissoclinum notti. Varacin was investigated for its use in ADEPT and a possible prodrug derivative was prepared. In addition, a novel biologically inactive purine, 8-oxo-1,3-dimethylisoguanine (6.29) was isolated from the New Zealand endemic ascidian Pseudodistoma cereum. The study of an ascidian of the genus Aplidium, collected from the Ross Sea, Antarctica resulted in the isolation of two novel quinone derivatives, rossinones A (5.71) and B (5.72), which exhibited potent cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. Rossinones A (5.71 ) and B (5.72) provide insights into the biosyntheses of several terrestrial plant natural products. In addition, six sea hares of three species collected from the Auckland, New Zealand region were surveyed using the same methodology, with three novel and seven known compounds being isolated. The study of the sea hare Aplysia dactylomela resulted in the isolation of two inactive novel tryptophan dipeptides, dactylamides A (7.9) and B (7.10), the known ink pigment aplysioviolin and four known sesquiterpenes. A new malyngamide, S (8.8) along with an algal toxin, lyngbyatoxin A and its acetate were isolated from the sea hare Bursatella leachii. A survey of nine algae collected from the same locations as the sea hares resulted in the identification of several of the dietary sources of these sea hares. Standard spectroscopic techniques were used for structural elucidation, including the use of natural abundance 1H-15N 2-D NMR where required. All compounds were assayed for a range of biological activities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiparametric maximum likelihood for multi-phase response-selective sampling and missing data problems</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Yannan</field><field name="description">Missing data is a common occurrence in most medical (or other) research data collection processes. Missing data patterns can be sometimes caused by design. In multi-phase response-selective sampling, the response variable Y and some easily-obtainable variables are fully observed for a first-phase sample or finite population. Some of the covariates of interest, X, which might be difficult or too expensive to obtain, are then observed at later phases for smaller subsamples. The selection of data at each phase is dependent on the categorical information of Y , with the choice of considering other fullyobserved discrete variables as a cross- or post-stratification. In this thesis, we start from the simple case-control study in which the data are collected under a two-phase response-selective sampling scheme. Special conditions are considered subsequently to pose different questions of interest. In a secondary study, we may be interested in another binary response variable Y2, which is associated with the original case-control response Y in the data. Conventional logistic regression analysis can no longer provide consistent parameter estimates in this case. We also consider the situation in which the case-control status of each subject is actually defined by dichotomising a continuous variable which is potentially available in the population. Ignoring this source of information as in binary logistic regression typically results in a loss of efficiency which may be substantial. Linear regression analysis can be carried out to efficiently estimate the logistic model odds-ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. The behaviour of various methods of analyses and sampling strategies for linear models are also discussed. We finally consider three-phase response-selective sampling designs, methods of analyses and some applications of three-phase methods. Our main approach for data analysis is semiparametric maximum likelihood. Survey-weighted methods, as well as other semiparametric approaches, are also considered for comparison. Their relative efficiencies and robustness properties are investigated using a wide range of simulation studies and real data analyses. The major conclusions for each type of analyses are as follows. When we have correlated bivariate outcomes in case-control studies, both the semiparametric maximum likelihood (SPML) method with joint modeling of bivariate responses, and the simple weighted method for the model of interest, can be used. The SPML method is often substantially more efficient than the weighted method, but subject to bias in estimating parameters of interest when its nuisance models have been misspecified. The weighted method needs no nuisance models and thus is robust in this regard, but we cannot tell when it&#8217;s going to be very inefficient without sophisticated modeling as through the SPML method. We suggest to use both at this situation. Conclusions borne out by both types of analyses are particularly credible. For the type of case-control studies in which the binary response is potentially available as, or categorised from a continuous variable, a linear regression analysis with logistic error distribution using this continuous variable as the response is suggested. The results can be easily coverted into estimates of binary regression parameters with substantially higher efficiency. When such linear regression analyses are of particular interest, both the twophase SPML method and the weighted method (with small modifications) are used to analyse data arising from various two-phase sampling designs. Introducing extra stratification in sampling as well as in the analysis can substantically increase efficiencies of both methods in estimating parameters of X strongly associated with a variable defining strata (say V). The SPML method is always efficient compared with the weighted method. Differences in efficiency are most noticeable under response-selective sampling, which is, however, precisely where the SPML method is least robust under error model misspecification. The weighted method is robust in this regard when a logistic error distribution is used, and also reasonably efficient under Vconditional sampling. We finally consider three-phase response-selective sampling and have developed appropriate three-phase SPML method to obtain efficient and consistent parameter estimates under arbitrary regression models. As a natural extention to Scott and Wild&#8217;s two-phase SPML method, this approach is always efficient compared with other semiparametric approaches. Its drawbacks are its complexity and its slow convergence in some situations. This can be simplified, however, in case-control studies using logistic regression analysis. Although a general introduction to the missing data literature is given in the first chapter, in this thesis, we deal only with some very structured problems which are versions of the multi-phase sampling problems discussed in Section 1.2. The survey of the broader field of missing data is given to put the work done here in its wider context. Happenstance missing values in example data are directly deleted for simplicity. More sophisticated methods for missing data could be used but would require further methodological development and therefore not be considered in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions of oxygenated organic molecules on the (111) surfaces of a uranium dioxide single crystal</field><field name="creator">Chong, Shen Vun</field><field name="description">This study involves the first investigation into the interactions, both the chemical pathways and adsorption behaviour, of a primary alcohol, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and a ketone on the surfaces of a UO2(111) single crystal under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The surfaces of the uranium dioxide single crystal were characterised via AES (Auger electron spectroscopy), LEED (low energy electron diffraction), and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), while the thermal chemistry was investigated via TPD (temperature programmed desorption) experiments. Thermal reactions of organic acids (i.e. ethanol, formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid) over the stoichiometric surface of UO2(111) were found to highly favour the dehydration route. In particular, TPD of acetic acid showed that nearly 85 % of the adsorbed acetates were converted to ketene. This is due to the intrinsic properties of UO2, in which its bulk Madelung potential (high) indicates an acidic character (in general acidic oxides tend to dehydrate, while basic oxides tend to dehydrogenate the reactants). Over the reduced surfaces of UO2(111) single crystal, several C&#8211;C coupling products were observed from surface aldehyde species (created from direct dosing or during thermal reactions). The most pronounced is the reductive carbonyl coupling reactions in forming alkenes due to the presence of surface defect sites. Aldehydes (and ketone) that possess ahydrogen also exhibited the ability to &#8220;aldol-condense&#8221; to form higher a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (for example the formation of crotonaldehyde from acetaldehyde). Furthermore, trimeric condensation reactions were also observed from acetaldehyde and acetone TPDs, in which benzene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were respectively formed. The adsorption behaviour of several organic compounds under investigation were also studied via dynamic AES and/or LEED over the polar oxygen terminated UO2(111) surface (stoichiometric). Based on the measured sticking coefficients and TPD experiments, the ease of adsorption of the molecules was found to be governed by the polarity (and acidity) of the molecules, and followed the trend of carboxylic acids &gt; alcohols &gt; aldehydes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In what sense a fisheries problem? : negotiating sustainable growth in New Zealand fisheries</field><field name="creator">Rees, Eugene Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the question of how seafood enterprises grow in a constrained resource economy and, specifically, examines the performance of New Zealand&#8217;s seafood sector since the introduction of the quota management system in 1986. It explores whether the quota management system and individual transferable quota have led to an increase in industry performance and competitiveness. Conventional theoretical arguments for the institution of quota management and transferable quota propose that re-regulation will lead to efficiency, and by implication, profitability gains for the seafood sector. A process-based methodological framework, utilising complementary methodological practices and triangulation using both qualitative and quantitative approaches is employed to examine New Zealand fishing enterprises across a number of scales. Forty subjects were formally interviewed throughout the fishing sector in Nelson, Marlborough, Wellington and Auckland. Informal ongoing conversations with many of the interview subjects, amongst others, in a number of fora (academic and industry conferences, wharves and dockside) also enriched the research. The thesis integrates ideas from political economy in order to begin to answer questions concerning the prospects for sustainability and development. The thesis is about what happens when we consider dimensions that are largely missing in the international literature on fisheries (the firm, region and communities, and territory, resources and markets). This thesis proposes that we must avoid treating quota management systems, individual transferable quota and associated property rights reforms as monolithic. Rather, New Zealand&#8217;s quota management system is geographically constituted and co-constructed by stakeholders who play ongoing and changing roles in an emergent dialogue concerning sustainable fisheries, fisheries management and commercial fishing in New Zealand. The thesis finds that volume and value of seafood has increased. However, this increase is largely at the expense of first foreign fishing companies and part-time fishermen, and later small independent fishermen. There has been a rationalisation of fishing effort allied with an increased emphasis in growing more product and more value through aquaculture and value-adding strategies. New geographies of production are emerging and some of these geographies may prove to be unsustainable. Lastly, firms that fish, and particularly quota owners, are actively inserting themselves into debates concerning sustainability, sustainable development and fisheries management in expected ways that have led to unintended and ongoing political and governmental reconfigurations of fisheries in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology, geochemistry, and genesis of the El Pen&#771;o&#769;n epithermal Au-Ag deposit, northern Chile : characteristics of a bonanza-grade deposit and techniques for exploration</field><field name="creator">Warren, Patrick Ian</field><field name="description">The El Pe&#241;&#243;n gold-silver deposit comprises six epithermal veins, which contain a geologic resource (measured + indicated + inferred) of 3.8 million oz Au and 63 million oz Ag. The deposit is hosted in Paleocene and Eocene mafic to felsic volcanic rocks and is located in the central portion of the Paleocene metallogenic belt, 165 km southeast of Antofagasta. Older and younger igneous rocks occur in the district; Late Cretaceous and Eocene intermediate composition rocks record the effects of hydrothermal activity not related to precious metal mineralisation of the El Pe&#241;&#243;n deposit. Rocks in the district display two distinct types of hydrothermal alteration: widespread alteration associated with near-neutral pH, reduced fluid and localised alteration associated with acidic pH, oxidised fluid. Near-neutral pH, reduced fluid produced widespread replacement of phenocrysts and groundmass by quartz, adularia, albite, illite, chlorite, smectite, calcite, and pyrite; quartz-adularia alteration (replacement of primary phases, vein fillings, and hydrothermal breccia matrices) intensifies in the vicinity of precious metalbearing veins. Acidic pH, oxidised fluid produced lithocaps of massive quartz-alunite alteration, quartz-alunite cemented breccia, and, locally, weak Cu mineralisation above inferred Late Cretaceous and Eocene intrusions. Adularia from the two largest veins is dated at 52 to 53 Ma (40Ar/39Ar), indicating formation 1 to 3 m.y. later than host rhyolite domes. Quartz-alunite alteration spatially associated with Late Cretaceous and Eocene intermediate composition intrusive rocks is dated at 70-69 Ma and 50-49 Ma, respectively. Dating of supergene alunite indicates that weathering within a semi-arid to arid climate occurred from 23-17 Ma, prior to the onset of hyperaridity. The veins that comprise the El Pe&#241;&#243;n deposit range from &lt;0.5 m to 22 m wide; the bonanza-grade Quebrada Colorada vein has a strike length of ~2 km, vertical extent of ~500 m (1377-1877 m asl), and varies in width from 0.5 m to 4.5 m. Pervasive supergene oxidation extends to 400 m below surface. Limited drill intercepts at deeper levels consist of banded and brecciated quartz, adularia, and massive, bladed, and acicular, Ca-, Fe-, Mn-, and Mgbearing carbonate minerals, with minor amounts of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena. Veins exhibit a wide range of crustiform textures, including comb, colloform, and lattice quartz, rhombic adularia, and abundant massive and bladed Fe- and Mn-oxide minerals. Recrystallization textures suggest amorphous silica and chalcedony precursors for some quartz. Coexisting liquid- and vapor-rich inclusions, lattice textures, and vein adularia are evidence for boiling conditions that were likely responsible for Au-Ag deposition. Ore minerals observed in oxidised veins consist of electrum (mostly 40-60 wt % Au), acanthite, gold, silver, silver sulfosalts, silver halides, and rarely pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena. High ore grades are generally associated with massive bands of fine-grained quartz and adularia, breccias composed of vein clasts in a matrix of fine-grained quartz and adularia, and, less commonly, colloform quartz bands. Supergene processes resulted in local remobilisation of Au and Ag, leaving nearly pure gold (up to 98 wt % Au) along fractures and associated with oxide masses. Fluid inclusion data from the El Pe&#241;&#243;n deposit indicate vein formation from low salinity (&lt;2 eq. wt % NaCl), boiling hydrothermal fluid at temperatures mostly from 230 to 260&#176;C. 18O values of quartz range from 5 to 8 per mil, which can be explained by boiling and cooling of a single parent liquid of probable meteoric origin. Comparison of the amount of Au and quartz contained in the Quebrada Colorada vein to mass fluxes in the Broadlands- Ohaaki geothermal system indicates that the vein could have formed in as little as a few thousand years. Abundant geochemical analyses (&gt;7000 surface samples and &gt;4000 drill hole samples) provide ample data with which to evaluate vectors to ore. Geochemical gradients in altered rocks surrounding veins in the El Pe&#241;&#243;n district indicate that Au, Ag, As, and Sb concentrations increase toward mineralised quartz veins. Geochemical analyses of altered rocks from drill holes surrounding the Quebrada Colorada vein show enrichment of Au and Ag and depletion of Ca, Na, and Sr toward the vein; As and Sb increase with elevation. Mass changes calculated using whole-rock geochemical data also show gradients that are centred on mineralised veins; K is typically enriched toward veins, whereas Na and Ca are depleted. Whole-rock geochemical data are used to evaluate hydrothermal alteration mineralogy so that gradients of mass change can be related to associated zoning of hydrothermal minerals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General linear methods with inherent Runge-Kutta stability</field><field name="creator">Wright, William Matthew</field><field name="description">General linear methods were derived approximately thirty years ago as a unifying approach for the study of consistency, stability and convergence of the Runge-Kutta and the linear multistep methods. Their discovery opened the possibility of obtaining essentially new methods which were neither Runge-Kutta nor linear multistep methods nor slight variations of these methods. It was hoped that general linear methods would exist which are practical and have advantages over the traditional methods. Locating such practical methods has proved difficult though, for several reasons. For example, the complexity of the order conditions becomes very high, making it difficult to even find the required conditions in many cases let alone solve them. Several simplifying assumptions must be made, which limit this large class to situations where practical methods are likely to exist. The first assumption is that the stage order is equal to the overall order of the general linear method. This results in methods which, among other things, are not affected by the order reduction phenomenon. The second assumption is that a Nordsieck vector is passed from step to step. This enables such methods to vary the stepsize in a convenient and practical way. The final assumption is that the stability regions of the general linear methods should be identical to those of corresponding Runge-Kutta methods. The first two assumptions are satisfied by the structure of the U and V matrices of the general linear methods. In order to satisfy the last assumption sufficient conditions are developed. These conditions result in a class of general linear methods with a property known as inherent Runge- Kutta stability (IRKS). The IRKS conditions relate the coefficient matrices of the general linear method with a doubly companion matrix X to satisfy BA = XB, BU &#8801; XV - VX, &#963;(V) = {1,0}. Constructing general linear methods with the IRKS property in the most general way possible is the main aim of this thesis. To derive these methods a transformation is used; this transformation brings all methods of this class into a particular form, which allows the construction using only linear operations. Several special properties of methods with the IRKS property are introduced. For example, conditions which show that the ESIRK methods are a special case of the IRKS methods are introduced. This then allows the introduction of a new class of ESIRK methods which may have advantages over those already known. Also, methods which have a property known as strong stiff accuracy are developed which make them similar to strictly stable Runge-Kutta methods. Methods with strong stiff accuracy are likely to be considered good, particularly because they are the most suitable amongst the IRKS methods for the solution of differential algebraic equations. The theoretical properties of the general linear methods with IRKS are investigated using various implementations from fixed stepsize and fixed order to variable stepsize and variable order codes. The IRKS methods are experimentally compared with several traditional methods, which provides evidence that the IRKS methods may in fact be suitable to form the kernel of an efficient solver of ordinary differential equations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organics in atmospheric particulates</field><field name="creator">Khanal, Obi</field><field name="description">The use of headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) as a sample concentration and preparation technique for the analysis of organics in air particulates has been developed and optimised. Organic compounds in atmospheric particulate matter (PM) collected on quartz filters were found to yield a maximum gas chromatographic response (peak area) on heating at 100oC for 30 minutes. The most effective sample cooling time prior to sample concentration was found to be 7 minutes and the best exposure equilibrium time was 10 minutes. The optimum GC/MS desorption time determined was 5 minutes. The precision and reproducibility of this HS-SPME method was found to be very good. Atmospheric particulate (PM10) from Auckland, Hamilton and Christchurch, New Zealand, were collected on a daily basis through a series of seasonal campaign in 1999 to 2001. Organic compounds from the particulate samples were extracted and concentrated by HS-SPME and analysed by GC/MS. The technique of SPME headspace followed by GC/MS analysis has been used for the first time to analyse atmospheric particulates. Two years of samples from spring 1999 were collected and analysed qualitatively. A large number of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds from air particulates were identified and found to differ from site to site. The compounds found on the PM10 samples were classified into four different classes as most common, common, less common, and rare. The compounds which ranged from highly volatile (methylene chloride and benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) to less volatile (heptadecane and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol)were identified and a variation between seasons observed. The organics identified in the particulate matter are known to be associated with both natural and anthropogenic sources. The boiling points of the detected organics ranged from 40oC to 391oC and were found to be normally distributed. However, most of the organics (66%) were found to have their boiling point range between 140 and 240oC. Vapour pressure of organics ranged from 0.0002 to 10.13 kPa, but 82% were found to be within the range of 0.05 to 1.0 kPa. Similarly the carbon number varied from C2&#8722;C24, with 68% of the total organics being C8&#8722;C13. The carbon number distribution was different between aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The concentrations of sixteen PAHs species in PM10 extracts were measured using GC/MS. Significant site and seasonal differences were observed and Hamilton recorded the lowest levels of all PAHs over all seasons. The highest seasonal variation was observed in Christchurch, where the total PAH concentrations in winter was 14 times higher than in autumn and unbelievably, 43 times higher than in summer, which was mostly contributed by benzo(k)fluoranthene and indino(1,2,3-cd)pyrene. All sites experienced peaks in their PAH concentrations in winter and lows in summer. Concentration ratios of the PAHs suggest that the main source of PAHs in New Zealand cities is from the combustion of fossil fuels. Overall this source contributed 71% to the total PAHs in Auckland, 72% in Christchurch, and 67% in Hamilton.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Geometry, Data Structures and Applications of Ancestral Selection Graphs</field><field name="creator">Cloete, Nicoleen</field><field name="description">The genealogy of a random sample of a population of organisms can be represented as a rooted binary tree.

Over the last decade there has been considerable growth in the commercial dolphin-based tourism industry. This growth exposes coastal populations to boats and swimmers. New Zealand has allowed commercial operations offering swimming with wild dolphins since 1989. Little is known about the effects of boats and swimmers on dolphin behaviour. The present study examines a population of bottlenose dolphins that utilise the Bay of Islands as part of their range along the northeastern coast of New Zealand, and their behavioural response to commercial swim-with-dolphin operations. Data were collected from an independent research boat and the commercial dolphinwatching boats from December 1996 to February 2000. Photo-identification showed a closed population of 446 (95% C.I. 418-487) dolphins, with an 81% resight rate of the 378 catalogued individuals. Group size ranged from 2 &#8211; 50 dolphins, with 80% of groups (n = 160) containing 2 - 20 dolphins. The number of groups with calves present increased from 32% (n = 17) in 1997, to 63% (n = 47) in 1999. This could be explained by the increased number of neonates born; from four in 1997, to nine in 1999. Photo-identification in areas outside the Bay of Islands showed that individuals ranged minimum distances of 82 km north, and 388 km south of the Bay of Islands. All photographs taken outside the Bay of Islands were matched to known animals, suggesting that the majority of the northeastern coastal population is seen in the Bay. With the next nearest population of bottlenose dolphins approximately 1,000 km south, these dolphins probably form an isolated population ranging along the east coast of the northeastern North Island. Habitat use by the dolphins was examined using Geographic Positioning System (GPS) points simultaneously linked to behavioural states. In total, 31 groups were followed, and 847 GPS points were recorded. Position of initial encounter was recorded for 138 groups of dolphins. There was a significant correlation between water depth and sea-surface temperature, with dolphins found in deeper waters in summer when water temperature was highest, and in shallow waters in winter when the water temperature was lowest. Only one behavioural state, slow travel, was significantly different by season. Although all behaviours were observed in all zones, dolphins had preferential habitat use throughout the four zones within the Bay. To determine the level of impact on dolphin behaviour due to boat traffic, focal-group follows using a scan sample methodology were conducted from an independent research boat. A CATMOD analysis was used to determine dolphin behaviour by season, number of boats, and group size. Dolphin behaviour differed by boat number; in particular, resting behaviour decreased as boat number increased and milling behaviour increased as boat number increased. Behaviour differed when the research boat was the only boat present. Closer examination of boat type, i.e., permitted dolphin watching boats, non-permitted tour boats, and recreational boats, found a difference in dolphin behaviour in the presence of the permitted boats when compared to the other types. Dolphins rested less and engaged in more milling behaviour when the permitted boats were present. Responses to swim attempts from the commercial boats were compared from 1994 - 1995 to 1997 - 1998. In total, 255 groups were encountered of which 36% (n = 93) were exposed to at least one swim attempt. Successful swims (i.e., where at least one dolphin remained within 5 m of at least one swimmer) decreased from 48% in 1994 - 1995 to 34% in 1997 - 1998 and avoidance responses increased from 22% to 31%. Dolphin response varied according to swimmer placement from the boats. The &#8216;in path&#8217; placement had the highest level of avoidance. Only &#8216;line abreast&#8217; placement resulted in a decrease in avoidance. Based on the photo-identification sighting records, it was estimated that an average dolphin was exposed to 31 swim attempts per year. This suggests that individual dolphins have, with cumulative experience, become sensitised to swim attempts. If a swim attempt was successful, on average, it involved 19% of the group. Juveniles were more likely to interact with swimmers than adults. The present study suggests that the wide-ranging population of bottlenose dolphins that frequents the Bay of Islands is exposed to levels of tourism which can affect the dolphins behaviour. In particular, the permitted boats&#8217; presence results in decreased resting behaviour by the dolphins. The apparent sensitisation of this population to swim attempts, and the relatively small number of individual dolphins that interact with swimmers, are grounds for concern about the long-term impact of interactions. Ongoing monitoring of this populations&#8217; response to swimmers and boats, combined with a precautionary approach to management of boats and swimmers, are recommended.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vertical distribution of atmospheric BrO from ground-based measurements</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Robyn</field><field name="description">Ground-based UV-Visible measurements targeting BrO were made at Lauder, New Zealand (45.0&#176;S, 169.7&#176;E) and Arrival Heights, Antarctica (77.8&#176;S, 166.7&#176;E). Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) was used to determine differential slant column densities (DSCDs) from the radiance measurements. UV-Visible measurements have been made in the two complementary viewing geometries of direct-sun and zenith-sky. A spherical curved earth single scattering radiative transfer model was developed. The effects of refraction, molecular absorption, Rayleigh and Mie scattering were included. Singularity at the tangent point was avoided and a complete intensity calculation performed. The DSCDs for both the direct-sun and zenith-sky viewing measurements were calculated with this forward model. A general optimal estimation retrieval algorithm was developed to retrieve altitude information by combining DSCDs from the direct-sun and zenith-sky viewing geometries. A complete retrieval characterisation and error analysis was performed. The characterisation illustrated that tropospheric sensitivity was obtained from the direct-sun viewing measurements, while the zenith-sky measurements were essential for stratospheric sensitivity. Stratospheric and tropospheric BrO columns were retrieved for the diurnal stages of 80&#176;, 84&#176; and 87&#176; SZA for Lauder. The diurnal and seasonal variation of the stratospheric column was successfully retrieved from the measurements. The stratospheric columns were consistent with a stratospheric Bry loading of 20 ppt. The tropospheric BrO column retrieved over Lauder was less than 0.9 ppt if a uniform distribution throughout the troposphere is assumed. This is consistent with, though lower than, previous estimates of BrO in the free troposphere of 0.5-2.0 ppt (Richter et al., 2002). The results of a ten week measurement campaign at Arrival Heights for the spring 2002 are presented. Stratospheric and tropospheric BrO columns were retrieved at 80&#176;, 84&#176; and 88&#176; SZA. A high variability was observed for the retrieved stratospheric columns, due in part to the unusual stratospheric warming in the Antarctic spring 2002 (Allen et al., 2003). A mean ubiquitous tropospheric background of 0.3 ppt was retrieved. Also a &#8216;bromine explosion&#8217; event was observed, corresponding to a BrO mixing ratio of 7 ppt for a uniformly mixed boundary layer.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Convergence of Lyapounov Functions Along Trajectories of Nonexpansive Semigroups: Generic Convergence and Stability</field><field name="creator">Choudhary, Renu</field><field name="description">The main aim of this thesis is to study the convergence of Lyapounov functions along the trajectories of nonexpansive semigroups in a Hilbert space. The outline of the thesis is as follows. In Chapter 3, it is shown that a regularly Lyapounov function for a semigroup of contractions on a Hilbert space converges to its minimum along the trajectories of the semigroup. In Chapter 4, we show that while a convex Lyapounov function for a semigroup of contractions on a Hilbert space may not converge to its minimum along the trajectories of the semigroup, it converges generically along the trajectories of the semigroups generated by a class of bounded perturbations of the semigroup generator. In Chapter 5, we show that the regularly Lyapounov function nearly converges to its minimum along the trajectories of the semigroups generated by small bounded perturbations of the semigroup generator. Besides that we study a problem of interest in its own right, about the direction of movement of the element of minimal norm in a moving convex set, in Section 4.9. We show that if C is a nonempty closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space H, e is a non-zero arbitrary vector in H, and for each t &#1028; R, z(t) is the closest point in C + te to the origin, then the angle z(t) makes with e is a decreasing function of t while z(t) &#8800; 0.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lyapounov functions, Generic convergence, Semigroups,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian Strategies for Gravitational Radiation Data Analysis</field><field name="creator">Umstaetter, Richard</field><field name="description">This work addresses the exploration of Bayesian MCMC methods applied to problems in gravitational wave physics. The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is presented for estimating the astrophysical parameters of gravitational radiation signals from a neutron star in laser interferometer data. This computational algorithm can estimate up to six unknown parameters of the target, including the rotation frequency and frequency derivative, using reparametrization, delayed rejection and Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Results will be given for different synthesized data sets in order to demonstrate the algorithm&#8217;s behaviour for different observation lengths and signal-to-noise ratios. The probability of detecting weak signals is assessed by a model comparison, based on the BIC, between a model that postulates a signal and one that postulates solely noise within the data. The second part of the thesis adresses the tremendous data analysis challenges for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) with the need to account for a large number of gravitational wave signals from compact binary systems expected to be present in the data. The basis of a Bayesian method is introduced that can address this challenge, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a simplified problem involving one hundred synthetic sinusoidal signals in noise. The reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is deployed to infer simultaneously the number of signals present, the parameters of each identified signal, and the noise level. This approach is specifically focused on the detection of a large number of sinusoids with separation of sinusoids that are close in frequency. A robust post-processing technique handles the label switching problem by a frequency interval separation technique with a subsequent classification according to a mixed model approximation. The algorithm therefore tackles the detection and parameter estimation problems simultaneously, without the need to evaluate formal model selection criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion or explicit Bayes factors. The method produces results which compare very favorably with classical spectral techniques.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics, Specificity, and Ecology of New Zealand Rhizobia</field><field name="creator">Weir, Bevan</field><field name="description">This research investigated the rhizobia that are associated with New Zealand legume plants. Rhizobia are a diverse group of bacteria that live in symbiosis with legumes in root nodules. Rhizobia fix Nitrogen from the atmosphere and provide this nutrient to the plant. The objectives of this research were to: 1) Determine the identity of the rhizobial species nodulating the native legumes of New Zealand: Sophora (kowhai), Carmichaelia (NZ broom), and Clianthus (kakabeak); and the identity and origin of rhizobial species nodulating invasive exotic legumes in New Zealand: Ulex (gorse), Cytisus (broom), and Acacia (wattles). 2) Determine the specificity and nitrogen fixing capacity of both groups of rhizobia. 3) Investigate the possible exchange of transmissible symbiotic genetic elements. A polyphasic strategy was used to determine the identity of bacterial isolates. The 16S rRNA, atpD, recA, and glnII genes were PCR amplified and sequenced, then analysed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Phenotypic characters were also assessed by use of the Biolog and FAME techniques. Nodulation and fixation ability was assessed by inoculating legume seedlings with rhizobial strains, then determining nitrogenase activity after ten weeks by gas chromatography, and examining roots for nodules. A gene involved in symbiosis, nodA, was sequenced from rhizobial strains to determine if transmission between strains had occurred. The results of the experiments showed that the native legumes were predominately nodulated by diverse Mesorhizobium spp. that contain three different nodA genotypes (two of which are novel) that have transferred between rhizobial strains. The Mesorhizobium spp. showed little nodulation specificity and could nodulate an exotic legume Astragalus (milk vetch), but not the invasive weed legumes. Rhizobium leguminosarum was also found to nodulate native legumes, albeit ineffectively. The exotic invasive woody legumes of this study were nodulated by diverse Bradyrhizobium spp. that had nodA genotypes typical of Australian and European species. The origins of these bacteria can not be categorically determined. However the evidence is presented to suggest that nodulating Mesorhizobium spp. arrived with the ancestors of the native legumes, while Bradyrhizobium spp. nodulating Ulex and Cytisus arrived recently from Europe. Bradyrhizobium spp. nodulating Acacia may be recently introduced, possibly from Australia, although further work is required to confirm these hypotheses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhizobia</field><field name="subject">native legumes</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">mesorhizobium</field><field name="subject">bradyrhizobium</field><field name="subject">kowhai</field><field name="subject">sophora</field><field name="subject">rhizobium</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrology of the Cuvier and Paritu Plutons and their metamorphic Aureoles</field><field name="creator">Black, Philippa</field><field name="description">Note 1.

One of these is the study of various life history stages associated with reproduction. Fertilization ecology in broadcast spawning marine organisms, i.e. the process by which sperm and egg fusion occurs once released into the ocean, has been the subject of intensive study for roughly the last 20 years, and represents thus a recent field in ecological sciences. This growth in interest was sparked by studies that showed spawning events may take place predominantly under sperm limiting conditions. More recent findings however, suggest that the occurrence of sperm competition, and the risk of polyspermy (multiple sperm entry in to the egg, which is lethal in echinoderms) can also occur during reproductive events in marine invertebrates. This has also been predicted on theoretical grounds. Even though polyspermy has been observed previously, particularly during aquaculture studies, evidence to assess the occurrence of polyspermy in situ, and the conditions under which it occurs is lacking. Simulated field studies in Evechinus chloroticus as well as laboratory studies in E. chloroticus and Coscinasterias muricata found high levels of polyspermy, even under the sperm limiting conditions that are naturally found in the field in other marine broadcast spawners. Furthermore, laboratory results in both Evechinus and Coscinasterias showed that polyspermy is most likely to increase when sperm concentrations are increased. In addition, even though increasing sperm concentrations increases monospermy to a certain extent, an increase in gamete contact times generates similar levels of monospermy. Results from these studies confirmed the mathematical model predicting some of these events. The timing of gamete release to achieve maximum fertilization success (monospermy) in a broadcast spawner is thought to be under strong selective pressures, because reproductive success is directly related to fitness. The spawning patterns in the sea urchin E. chloroticus observed in this study demonstrated that E. chloroticus spawns under varying environmental and ecological conditions. Interestingly, it appeared that highly synchronous and widespread spawning was found to occur when highly turbulent conditions existed. This may reduce the potential for polyspermy that may exist during mass spawnings under shallow and calm conditions. The demonstration of polyspermy and the confirmation of the mathematical model, suggest that polyspermy is a common and frequent occurrence during broadcast spawning events. Thus polyspermy represents an evolutionary force that may shape the evolution of reproductive phenomena at levels ranging from the gamete to the population.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raman scattering in optical fibres</field><field name="creator">Wardle, David</field><field name="description">The Raman effect is the inelastic scattering of photons by matter. When a monochromatic light beam (pump beam) propagates in an optical fibre, spon- taneous Raman scattering transfers some of the photons to new frequencies. The probability of a photon scattering to a particular frequency shift, depends on that frequency shift, forming a characteristic spectrum. The scattered photons may lose energy (Stokes) or gain energy (anti-Stokes). If the pump beam is linearly polarized, then the polarization of scattered photons may be the same (parallel scattering) or orthogonal (perpendicular scattering). If photons are already present at other frequencies then the probability of scattering to those frequencies is enhanced (stimulated scattering). In this thesis, the equations governing the Raman effect, both in bulk glass and single mode fibre, are restated. The probability of spontaneous scattering (parallel and perpendicular) in an optical fibre has been measured for frequency shifts between 4THz and 58THz. Particular attention has been given to those frequency shifts where the scattering is intrinsically weak. This has identified those frequency shifts where it might be possible to eliminate Raman noise from experiments designed to generate quantum states of light in optical fibres using four wave mixing. From the measured scattering probabilities, the Raman equations can be used to predict the scattering cross-section in bulk glass. The prediction is found to be in reasonable agreement with measurements of the bulk glass cross-section published by other authors. By increasing the pump power, the transition to stimulated scattering has been observed. In the case of Stokes scattering there is reasonable agreement between the Raman equations and experimental observations. In the case of anti-Stokes scattering, and in the limit of very high pump power, behaviour is observed which is not predicted by the Raman equations, indicating that other processes must be included to successfully describe such experiments.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minors and planar embeddings of digraphs</field><field name="creator">Sneddon, Jamie David</field><field name="description">Embedding graphs in surfaces is the central concept of topological graph theory. Classifying embeddability of graphs is motivated by Kuratowski&#8217;s Theorem and Robertson-Seymour theory, which confirms that the set of obstructions to embeddability in an arbitrary surface is finite. We consider embedding directed graphs in surfaces, with restrictions on the direction of arcs in the local rotation at each vertex. Clustered planar digraphs have planar embeddings in which, at each vertex, all of the in-arcs occur sequentially in the local rotation. Three different variations of minors are presented, each of which produces a finite set of obstructions to clustered planarity. These variations include new operations on digraphs, and measures which refine the partial ordering. Tournaments are digraphs with exactly one edge between every distinct pair of vertices. The domination graph of a tournament is a graph with the same vertices, and an edge between two of the vertices if every other vertex is beaten by one of those two vertices. We present two variations of domination graphs, and investigate the relationships between them and their limitations. We investigate those graphs which may be domination graphs of tournaments using excluded minors. Such graphs have a finite set of obstructions under a modification of the minor partial order.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherence in Atom and Quantum Optics</field><field name="creator">Wong, Tony</field><field name="description">This thesis is the result of three years research in the Physics department at the University of Auckland. This research can be roughly divided into three projects. In the first year, Professor Dan Walls brought to my attention an experiment performed by Eichmann and co-workers. They observed interference of resonance fluorescence from two trapped ions using a polarization-sensitive detection scheme. We applied traditional quantum optics methods to analyze this experiment. A numerical technique, the Monte Carlo wave function method was used to simulate the classical motion of the ions and various orientations of the incident light. The results of Eichmann's experiment has been claimed by Scully and co-workers to support their view that only complementarity is required to explain the loss of interference in which-way schemes. However, our analysis shows to the contrary that Eichmann's experiment cannot be regarded as a which-way experiment and its results can be understood without resorting to these which-way arguments. The experimental Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases and the avalanche of theoretical work that followed it provoked our second project. Following a simplistic model of interference between two bose-condensates suggested by Javanainen we explore the establishment of the relative phase. We extend his work by including the effect of collisions (atom-atom interactions). Although we treat the condensate with a single mode model so that the formulation looks similar to quantum optics, these condensates consist of atoms and the resultant atom-atom interactions introduces an additional complexity; that of non-linear effects. Viewpoints must also be altered, absolute phase in a matter wave such as a bose-condensate is unphysical thus motivating an analysis of relative phases between two condensates. This project lasted for about one and a half years with injections of fresh input from several collaborators. Firstly, Professor Ewan Wright became involved in the collapse and revivals of the phase. His work on the collapse using a multi-mode single condensate was connected with our single-mode two condensate material. Secondly, during Professor Robert Graham's short stay at the University of Auckland, he performed analytic calculations of the establishment of the relative phase for the cases of thermal or Poissonian initial states. This work fitted nicely with our numerical efforts in this regime where our knowledge of the initial atom number is uncertain. Finally, Dr Karl Vogel and Bernhard Kneer, a Ph.D. student studying under Professor Wolfgang Schleich, started the third project with their atom laser proposal. The dynamics of a condensate confined in a trap was modelled by using a modified, Gross-Pitaevski equation that included both a pump and a loss term. This represents an atom laser since the confined condensate can be regarded as a "laser mode". My input into this model has been concentrated upon a spatially dependent loss. This has allowed us to study the influence of the pump and the spatially dependent loss on the shape and phase of the confined condensate in the steady-state regime. The scientific programming language Matlab&#169; was used to do the numerical component of my research. Mathematica&#169; has been useful in the analytical work, while the typesetting was done using Latex&#169;. The computers that were used ranged in power from a Macintosh IIfx to a Pentium 166, and the Sun Sparc 10 and 20 workstations.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations in Graphical Statistics</field><field name="creator">Murrell, Paul R.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the design and development of statistical graphics software &#8211; programs to help draw graphs. Graphs serve two major functions in statistics. Firstly, graphs are used for exploratory data analysis &#8211; for detecting the message in a set of data &#8211; and secondly, graphs are used for data display &#8211; for presenting the message in a set of data. The most important feature of software for exploratory data analysis is extensibility. This is the ability to quickly and easily develop new graphical images and is vital for being able to explore a data set in many different ways. The most important feature of software for data display is customisation. This is the ability to fine-tune a graphical image in great detail and is vital for the production of presentation-quality graphics. In both cases it is important that a graphical image should be constructed to best explore or show-off the peculiarities of a specific data set. A pervading theme of this thesis is that statistical graphics software should be flexible. The software tools described herin allow graphical images to be modified in arbitrary ways; the structure of graphical images is also arbitrary and not restricted to standard graph formats; a simple, coherent method, based on a general constraint system, for developing novel graphical images is explored; and a mechanism for specifying the arrangement of the components of a graphical image is introduced. Some of these ideas are incorporated within an existing statistical analysis package.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Marine Natural Product Synthesis, Isolation and Ecology</field><field name="creator">Lindsay, Brent Steven</field><field name="description">Previous studies indicated the marine pyridoacridone alkaloid ascididemin possessed a unique biological profile. Investigation of synthetic routes to ascididemin led to the discovery that ascididemin precursors possessed a wide range of biological activities. One precursor possessed hollow fiber in vivo antitumoral activity and continuing in vivo studies at the NCI, using subcutaneous xenograft assays, are in progress. A crystal structure of a precursor indicates that these tetracyclic heterocycles are planar, suggesting intercalation as a mechanism of antitumoral action. Ascididemin was synthesized by two novel ring E forming reactions. The superior methodology was also useful in the preparation of analogues, such as kuanoniamine A. Ascididemin possessed promising hollow fiber in vivo antitumoral activity but was poorly active in a subcutaneous xenograft study. Ascididemin was incapable of exerting antitumoral activity at a distance and further analogues were prepared to address this problem. Ten analogues were prepared, with all the non-bromine containing analogues selected for in vivo evaluation at the NCI. Two ring A analogues were prepared by a thennew synthetic route, including the antiviral natural product 11-hydroxyascididemin. 11-Methoxyascididemin was selected for hollow fiber evaluation. Two bromine containing ring D analogues were prepared, including the antifungal natural product 2-bromoleptoclinidinone. A crystal structure on 2-bromoleptoclinidinone was the first determined on a pyridoacridone alkaloid and the molecule was planar, further supporting an intercalative mechanism of action. Due to non-selective antitumoral cytotoxicity, ring D analogues are not useful antitumoral agents. Six carbon-based ring E analogues were prepared by novel methodology. All 6-substituted analogues assessed were selected for in vivo antitumoral evaluation. Hollow fiber antitumoral activity decreased with bulk of the substituent. 6-Methylascididemin has been selected for subcutaneous xenograft studies. The 5-substituted analogue prepared gave the best in vitro antitumoral profile of all alkaloids in this study and has been selected for in vivo evaluation. Ring E substituted N-8-deaza-ascididemin analogues possessed no antitumoral activity, highlighting the importance of the 1,10-phenanthroline-like bay region of ascididemin in antitumoral activity. Another four structurally novel, quinoid containing alkaloids have been selected tor in vivo evaluation. While ascididemin was the only compound capable of topoisomerase II&#945; cleavable complex stabilization, related alkaloids possessed a similar level of inhibitory action against this enzyme. This further supports intercalation as the dominant mechanism of action for pyridoacridone alkaloids. Ecological roles of four natural pyridoacridone alkaloids were assessed. Alkaloids were species specific antifeedant agents against important consumers. These alkaloids may have a long term detrimental effect on predator physiology, due to the well established ability of these alkaloids to interfere with cell proliferation. Ascididemin elicited avoidance responses in numerous marine species. Ascididemin has no antifouling activity against macrofoulers. Microbiological assessment of ascididemin, 11-hydroxyascididemin and 2-bromoleptoclinidinone indicated that modification of the ascididemin chromophore leads to the directing of antimicrobial activity towards a different phyla of parasites. Pyridoacridone alkaloids may be part of a non-antibody based immune system. All studies point to pyridoacridone alkaloids enhancing the eventual reproductive success of the organism. Biological and chemical evaluation of 29 New Zealand ascidians has been performed. Significant biological activity was detected in ten ascidians. Novel metabolites isolated were 2-(3'-bromo-4'-hydroxyphenol)ethanamine (Cnemidocarpa bicomuta) and 1,3-dimethylguanine (unidentified ascidian). Known metabolites isolated were 1,3-dimethylisoguanine (Cnemidocarpa bicomuta) and rubrolides A, B and C (unidentified ascidian). The survey highlighted the importance of overexpressed purine bases in ascidian metabolism. No physiological roles for these overexpressed purines are as yet apparent. Our study of NZ ascidians has led to the isolation of many compounds previously isolated from sponges. The widespread distribution of such metabolites gives credence to the theory that common metabolite-generating genes are present in both phyla, due to the evolutionary success of these genes. Two optically active 9-(5-S-methyl-5-sulfinyl-lyxofuranosyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (lyxosyl-MTAS) nucleosides were isolated from the nudibranch Doriopsis flabellifera. This is the first report of any lyxosyl-MTAS nucleoside as either a natural or synthetic product.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effective Order of Singly-Implicit Methods for Stiff Differential Equations</field><field name="creator">Chen, David Jen Lung</field><field name="description">Singly-implicit Runge-Kutta methods (SIRK) are designed for stiff differential equations. The existing code STRIDE based on these methods has been shown to be efficient for stiff problems, especially for high dimensional problems. However, SIRK methods with order greater than 2 possess the undesirable property that some of their abscissae are outside the integration interval. In order to improve the numerical behaviour of SIRK methods, we need to overcome this drawback. While retaining the original advantages of SIRK methods as much as possible, it would be advantageous to have more free parameters in choosing the coefficients for these methods. Recently, two generalizations of SIRK methods were introduced to overcome this difficulty. One is the so-called "DESI" (Diagonally Extended Singly-Implicit Runge-Kutta) method in which some additional diagonally implicit stages are added to the corresponding classical SIRK method. It turns out that there is more freedom in choosing the abscissae because of these extra stages. The other generalization is the so-called "ESIRK" (Effective order Singly-Implicit Runge-Kutta) method which adopts the idea of "effective order" so that the desirable free parameters come from "perturbed" initial values. The first approach has been verified to be a successful generalization. The existing variable order code DESI was shown to be more efficient than STRIDE, and competes well with the BDF (Backward Differentiation Formulae) code LSODE for many stiff problems (Butcher, Cash, Diamantakis [24] 1996). For the second approach, the numerical behaviour of ESIRK methods with variable stepsize, is closely related to the choice of the abscissae. In this thesis, it is shown that the classical SIRK methods are not the best choice with respect to the local truncation error. We analyze the numerical behaviour of the ESIRK methods both theoretically and experimentally. The choices of the abscissae for these methods are investigated. It is found that except when s = 2 (s is the number of stages in the method), the numerical results obtained with equally spaced abscissae in [0,1] are better than the corresponding SIRK methods for s = 3,. . .,6,8. Several alternative choices are also given. Some experimental variable-stepsize ESIRK codes are designed and are compared with the famous IRK codes SDIRK4, RADAU5 and the BDF code LSODE. The numerical results show that ESIRK methods are successful generalizations of the SIRK methods and are good candidates as solvers for stiff problems. In attempting to increase the efficiency of ESIRK methods, the idea of adding some additional diagonal stages is proposed. The generalizations of the ESIRK methods, called "EDESI" (Effective order Diagonally Extended Singly-Implicit Runge-Kutta) methods, are shown to be promising in solving stiff problems and are also successful generalizations of DESI and ESIRK methods.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calf Pregastric Lipase-A Kinetic Study</field><field name="creator">Manuel, Robyn Desma</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Interferometric Techniques in Profilometry and Spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Helg, Tina Louise</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis is in the fields of profilometry and Fourier transform spectrometry. Deformation measurement of diffuse objects by phase stepping was achieved by thermal frequency drift in a HeNe laser. The system was easy to construct, required no specialised components, was immune to the effects of piezo-actuator hysteresis, and was capable of producing phase maps in which noise was less than 1/20&#955;. A method was proposed for measuring absolute surface profile by scanning frequency over the range of a white light source. The coincidence technique of coherence radar was used to measure surface profiles in three dimensions to micron accuracy. Spatial techniques were developed to process the large data set quickly and efficiently. A novel Fourier transform spectrometer was developed to measure the spectrum of narrowband light sources. Heterodyning techniques gave a resolution of 0.01nm with a free spectral range of =2.5nm. The Sagnac common path design afforded immunity to vibration. The mode structure and mode hopping characteristics of a typical laser diode were measured as a function of diode injection current. An improved Fourier transform spectrometer was developed. Based on a Michelson interferometer. The instrument could resolve to 0.013nm over a =3nm free spectral range. Instrument operation was simplified and functionality was extended to non point sources.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Methods for the Removal of Colour from Pulp and Paper Mill Wastewater</field><field name="creator">Wingate, Kathryn G.</field><field name="description">Wastewater produced during pulp and paper manufacture is often highly coloured. Along with a decrease in the aesthetic appeal of the receiving water, the coloured material also reduces the penetration of the sunlight through the water which may decrease photosynthetic rates and affect aquatic productivity. As a result, there is strong pressure from environmental regulators for mills to reduce the colour of these wastewaters. Currently there is no sustainable colour removal technology available to remove this colour, predominantly due to economical restraints. The current study was undertaken with the aim of assessing novel and environmentally and economically sustainable technologies for the treatment of colour in pulp and paper mill wastewaters. A New Zealand softwood integrated bleached kraft mill was used for the technology assessment case studies. A synoptic survey of the mill was performed to locate the major sources of wastewater constituents and to select the most appropriate waste streams for application of these technologies. It was found that bleach plant wastewater was a significant source of colour (34% total mill load), dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 32%), and soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD, 25%), and was the predominant source of absorbable organic halides (AOX, ~100 %). Given these relative contributions, the concentrated flows arising from this source, and the relative case of retro-fitting a treatment process at full-scale, this wastewater was selected for remediation. The bleach plant wastewater is discharged in two waste streams, the acidic stream (pH 2) and the alkaline stream (pH 11). Two systems were investigated as colour removal tools; one chemical, the other biological. Both systems was chosen as suitable for the remediation of bleach plant wastewater (i.e. functioned in the required pH and temperature range), and because they were novel systems which had not been previously considered for removal of colour from wastewater. The first technology was an advanced oxidative process (AOP) which utilised macrocyclic tetraamide iron(III) complexes. These specially-designed complexes catalytically activate hydrogen peroxide and were developed by Collins et al., at Carnegie Mellon University. The activated complexes had previously been shown to be able to delignify and remove residual colour from kraft pulp. Preliminary trials indicated that these complexes would also have the potential to remove colour from pulp mill wastewaters. The second technology was an enzymatic treatment that utilised the enzyme cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH). Although the broader purpose of these enzymes in biological systems has not been firmly established, previous studies have demonstrated that CDH reactions could reduce quinones. Quinones are highly coloured, lignin-related species produced during the bleaching of pulp that have been hypothesised to contribute a significant proportion of the colour found in bleached kraft mill wastewaters. It was therefore postulated that this enzyme could form the basis of a biological colour treatment for bleached kraft mill wastewaters, with particular focus on colour removal. Studies were undertaken to assess the effects of substrate concentrations, pH, temperature and time. As the AOP technology functioned best under alkaline conditions, it was selected to remediate the alkaline bleach plant waste stream. Optimal conditions were determined at pH 11,9 and 7. At pH 11 the optimal conditions were found to be an activator concentration of 2 &#181;M (0.9 mg L-1), a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 26 mM (0.75 g L-1), 40&#186;C and 4 hours. As the pH decreased to 9, and then 7, more activator and peroxide was required to remove similar levels of colour from the alkaline waste stream. Under optimal conditions, the AOP was able to remove 47% of the colour from alkaline stage bleaching wastewaters. Additionally, using these conditions the AOP could remove 25% of the chlorinated organic material (as AOX), however it had no effect on the sCOD of the wastewater. For the enzymatic treatment two strains of enzyme were assessed. One strain, purified from the soft-rot fungus Humicola insolens,preferred alkaline conditions and was used to treat the alkaline stage bleaching wastewater, and the other strain, purified from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, preferred acid pH and was used to remediate the acid stage wastewater. Conditions required for the enzyme strain that preferred alkaline conditions were 0.01 IU of CDH, 7 mM (2.4 g L-1) of cellobiose, 40&#186;C and 4 days at pH 7. The enzyme was able to remove 41 % of the colour from the waste stream, however the enzyme treatment had no effect on the chlorinated organic content or the sCOD of the wastewater. Due to a limitation in acidophilic enzyme, optimal conditions were not fully characterised. However, it was found that using 0.1 IU of CDH,40&#186;C and 4 days at pH 4.5 resulted in a colour removal from the acid stage bleaching wastewater similar to that achieved for the enzyme strain that preferred alkaline conditions when treating the alkaline stage bleaching wastewater. An investigation of the structural changes in the wastewater organic material during treatment indicated that the AOP predominantly removed phenolic structures from the wastewater, in addition to structures containing aliphatic double bonds and carbonyl groups. In contrast, CDH solely reduced quinone structures. These findings were supported by studies using model compounds. With AOP treatment there were reaction rate differences for a range of phenolic model compounds with the most reactive compounds being vanillomandelic acid and catechol. Both technologies were able to remediate wastewater from other sources around the mill, such as the combined whole mill wastewater and the post-secondary treatment system wastewater. Removal efficiencies under optimal conditions were in the range 55 to 65%. In addition to the removal of colour from wastewater produced during pine processing, both technologies could also remediate wastewater produced during the processing of eucalypt, a hardwood. In this case treatment efficiencies were somewhat lower (33 and 27% for the AOP and enzyme technologies, respectively) possibly due to the difference in the nature of the chromophores in the hardwood wastewater. An environmental risk assessment of both technologies was undertaken. The results from this assessment indicated that the AOP treatment did not improve overall biological treatability of the wastewater. The enzyme treatment improved treatability of the wastewater by 92%. when measured as oxygen uptake of a microbial population. An investigation of the molecular weight distribution found the molecular weight distribution of the wastewater was not altered during treatment with the AOP, however it was altered during enzyme treatment with a preferential decrease in material &gt; 30 000 Dalton. When wastewater which had been pre-treated with the AOP was subjected to biological treatment, the wastewater showed a small colour increase of approximately l5% whereas 96% of the colour removed during enzyme treatment reverted under model aerated lagoon conditions. This finding was consistent with other studies which showed that structures reduced by the enzyme (i.e. quinones) could be oxidised back into their original form. In comparison, the colour removed by the AOP did not revert, suggesting that chromophores altered by the AOP were unable to reform. MicrotoxTM studies showed that neither the AOP activator, nor the enzyme were toxic to the receiving environment. An economic study was carried out which found that although the activator is not yet commercially available, the AOP technology could be economically feasible as long as the price of the activator was reasonable. Inventors of the activator estimate that its actual cost would be between USD 100 and 500 per kilogram. Using a worst case scenario of USD 500 per kilogram. it was estimated that if the activator was installed for the remediation of the alkaline bleach plant wastewater at the case study mill it would cost 1% of the value of the bleached pulp production, and result in a 12 % colour reduction of final wastewater. The economic study found that the enzyme treatment was not feasible (cost relative to value of production was 8%) due to the high substrate concentrations required. Overall, the study found that the AOP was a promising colour removal technology for the remediation of the alkaline bleach plant waste stream. Pilot plant trials for wastewater remediation using the AOP technology are expected to commence in the near future.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Mathematical Study of Calcium Oscillations and Waves</field><field name="creator">Tsaneva-Atanasova, Krasimira Todorova</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study theoretically the dynamics of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. We construct a mathematical model of the Ca2+ dynamics in pancreatic acinar cells. Although this model refers to a particular cell type, it also allows us to study some aspects of Ca2+ signalling in general. We begin by analysing the dependence of the Ca2+ oscillations on the plasma membrane transport. Further we study the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves in a pancreatic acinus. It has been observed experimentally that, in many cell types, calcium fluxes across the plasma membrane affect inositol trisphosphate IP3-induced calcium oscillations. Since IP3-induced calcium oscillations involve the cycling of calcium to and from the endoplasmic reticulum, it is not well understood how they can be so strongly affected by membrane fluxes. We use a mathematical model to answer this question; a model that relies on the introduction of a slow variable, the Ca2+ load of the cell. Our model predictions are confirmed by experimental results. Since similar behaviour is observed in two other models of IP3-induced Ca2+ oscillations, it is possible that this bifurcation structure is a generic feature of Ca2+ oscillation models. The effect of intercellular coupling on the oscillatory dynamics is investigated theoretically. It is demonstrated that junctional calcium diffusion can account for the co-ordination and synchronisation of cytosolic calcium oscillations in a coupled triplet of cells under the assumption of constant IP3 concentration in each individual cell. Furthermore a two dimensional version of that model, where Ca2+ and IP3 are assumed to diffuse within as well as between the cells, has been studied numerically. Compared to the results from the analysis of the ODE model, the results from the analysis of the PDE model (in two spatial dimensions) reveal some interesting spatial effects of the diffusion, and of the geometry of the cells on the collective oscillatory behaviour of the systen. Based on this combined approach, a suggestion about the specific role of both Ca2+ and IP3 in the intercellular Ca2+ signalling has been made.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organosilanes: Synthesis and Reactivity Directed Towards Annulations</field><field name="creator">Harris, Paul William Richard</field><field name="description">Ruthenium-catalysed coupling of alkenes (principally vinylsilanes) with the ortho C-H bond of a wide range of monocyclic, bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic ketones led to a high yield of ortho-alkylated adducts. A methoxy substituent located para to the directing carbonyl moiety had an activating effect while an ortho methoxy resulted in severe inhibition of the coupling reaction and methoxy cleavage was observed. However, an ortho TBDMS ether allowed the C-H/olefin coupling to proceed quantitatively, which was attributed to inhibition of catalyst quenching by preventing chelate formation. With a view to cyclopentaannulation, the adducts from the C-H/olefin coupling containing a ArCH2CH2SiMe3 side chain were functionalised by radical bromination leading to a 1,2-dibromo compound which was converted into a COCH3 by elimination and hydrolysis. An analogous sequence, when applied to a more complex substrate, gave products resulting from bromination and/or elimination at a different benzylic site. Attempted intramolecular aldol reactions of a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound failed and resulted instead in skeletal rearrangement. The carbon-silicon bond in ArCH2CH2SiMe3 could be converted into a silanol (RSiMe2OH) when treated with aluminium chloride, but attempts to oxidise the C-Si bond (to give an alcohol) in this compound were unsuccessful. Silicon-carbon bond oxidation in adducts containing a ArCH2CH2Si(OR)xMey side chain gave an ArCH2CH2OH fragment provided that a proximal ketone was converted to an alcohol prior to the oxidation to avoid unwanted Baeyer-Villiger reaction. The resultant 1,5-diols could not be oxidised directly to a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound, but were converted into a mono alcohol by ionic hydrogenation and subsequent deprotection in excellent overall yield. Successive benzylic and primary alcohol oxidation provided the required 1,5-dicarbonyl functionality, but this enone aldehyde was not suitable for cyclopentaannulation. Attempts to synthesise an alternative substrate (a keto aldehyde) via protection of the primary alcohol followed by benzylic oxidation were unsuccessful, but could be achieved by conjugate reduction of the enone. The ensuing pinacol coupling failed. The quassinoid ring system was accessed by functional group interconversion to yield a &#948;-keto ester, which underwent latonisation using SmI2. Coupling of alkynylsilanes with the ortho C-H bond of various aromatic ketones proceeded in high yield under ruthenium catalysis and resulted in the introduction of a vinyl group predominantly of E configuration. In contrast, the aromatic ketone 1-acetylnaphthalene, underwent cyclopentaannulation in a one-pot sequence under analogous conditions, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. This was proposed to occur via &#946;-silyl migration as a key step. Attempts to synthesise an alkynylsilane bearing alkoxy substituents failed and gave only a dialkyne, which underwent ruthenium-mediated C-H bond insertion cleanly. The resultant alkenylalkynylsilanes could not be oxidised to an aldehyde. Trimethyl orthoformate-promoted intramolecular cyclisation of the ortho vinylated aromatic ketones resulted in cyclopentaannulation in high yield. The newly formed 5-membered ring was confirmed by an X-ray structure of a diterpenoid analogue. Mono or tricyclic substrates produced benzofulvenes in high yield when the ketone was exocyclic, while a naphthalene derivative resulted in the isolation of methanol adducts. A diterpenoid containing a dihydrofuranyl ring could be synthesised via intramolecular Hg(II) cyclisation of an alcohol and a proximal alkene.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partial Oxidation of Methanol to Formaldehyde Over an Electrolytic Silver Catalyst</field><field name="creator">Waterhouse, Geoffrey Ivan Neil</field><field name="description">The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde over an electrolytic silver catalyst is a large-scale industrial process that provides the feedstock for the manufacture of synthetic resins, plastics and important chemical intermediates such as 1,4-butanediol and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). The process is carried out at atmospheric pressure by passing CH3OH vapour, in the presence of air and steam, through a thin bed of electrolytic silver catalyst operating adiabatically at temperatures between 873-973 K. Process yields of CH2O may be as high as 88-90 %. Competing reactions lead to the formation of CO2, HCOOH and CO. The objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and those factors which influence silver catalyst activity and selectivity to CH2O during CH3OH oxidation. Through the application of a variety of experimental techniques it is shown that the dissociative chemisorption of 02 activates electrolytic silver catalysts for CH3OH oxidation. Over the temperature range 448-1073 K, the oxygen inventory of silver catalysts comprises three distinct atomic oxygen species: two surface species (denote O&#945; and O&#947;) and a bulk-dissolved species (O&#946;). The surface species are distinguishable by their Ag-O bonding, thermal stability and reactivity differences. O&#945; is formed by the dissociative chemisorption of O2 on Ag(110) or Ag(111) planes. The species is weakly bound, possesses bridging Ag-O-Ag bonding and strong nucleophilic character, and opens reaction pathways towards CH2O, CO2 and HCOOH. Recombinative desorption of O&#945; as O2 commences at temperatures above 580 K. O&#947; formation occurs exclusively on reconstructed Ag(111) planes. The species possesses a highly covalent Ag=O bonding interaction and exists to temperatures in excess of 923 K in the presence of gas phase O2. O&#947; activates silver catalysts for the oxidative-dehydrogenation of CH3OH to CH2O + H2O, but shows no selectivity towards CO2 or HCOOH production. Bulk-dissolved oxygen (O&#946;) exchanges reversibly with the O&#945; and O&#947; species. The product distribution of CH3OH oxidation over electrolytic silver catalysts is controlled by the relative surface populations of the O&#945; and O&#947; states. Formaldehyde selectivity and yield increase with temperature up to 923 K, CH3OH/O2 feed ratio from 1.5-2.25 and catalyst grain boundary density, all of which reflect a corresponding increase in the surface O&#947; / O&#945; ratio on the catalysts. An optimum formaldehyde yield of 84.3 % was obtained during testing of the silver catalysts, under conditions close to those employed industrially (temperature = 923 K, molar feed composition CH3OH/O2/H2O/He = 2.25/1/1.7/20, GHSV = 1.25x105 h-1). Above 923 K, yields decreased due to the homogeneous decomposition of CH2O to CO + H2. Pronounced thermal and catalytic etching of the silver catalyst occurred during activation under conditions of industrial CH2O synthesis. Critically, structures created by these processes promote O&#946; and O&#947; formation, and improve catalyst performance. Results were used to develop comprehensive reaction schemes for CH3OH oxidation over electrolyic silver catalysts. The thermal decomposition of Ag1Ag111O2 in air was examined in relation to the industrial practice of adding silver oxides to silver catalyst beds to facilitate 'light off' during start up operations. Ag1AglllO2 was thermally reduced to metallic silver via two non-reversible steps, with the intermediate formation of Ag2O. The transformation of Ag1Ag111O2 to Ag2O occurred with heating in the 373-473 K region, while the product of this reaction remained stable to temperatures in excess of 623 K. Complete thermal decomposition of the Ag2O intermediate to Ag and O2 occurred at673 K. The oxidation of several silver substrates by reaction with ozone (5 mol % O3 in 02) was examined as potential route to the production of silver catalysts of high initial activity towards CH3OH oxidation. At 300 K, the Ag substrates were oxidised by O3 to yield Ag2O and monoclinic Ag1Ag111O2. The Ag1Ag111O2, formed at the gas/oxide interface, via the oxidation of Ag2O.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Groundwater Regime of the Waihi Basin, North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ling, Lim</field><field name="description">The study seeks to understand the complex groundwater systems within Waihi Basin (Coromandel Area, North Island, New Zealand), a river basin covering c.140km2 which is drained by a single river, the Ohinemuri River. These groundwater systems are hosted by rather shallow, fracture ignimbrite aquifers and deeper andesite rocks infilling the basin down to depths of c.2km. All groundwaters are found to mix freely with infiltrating meteoric water throughout the whole basin. Because of the favourable river basin setting, all existing meteorological and hydrological data collected during 1992 to 1996 were analysed in terms of the mass balance components. Incomplete data sets only allowed the assessment of the three major components for the year 1994, namely total precipitation (0.22km3/yr), total evapotranspiration (0.1lkm3/yr) and total stream discharge (0.13 km3/yr). The ratio of these major components in the other years appears to be similar. Other smaller components in the mass balance were assessed by numerical modeling. For this, the whole basin was subdivided into numerous blocks and three layers with the intersection of the blocks reflecting gross tectonic structures. The observed piezometric levels of the groundwater wells intersecting the two top layers were used as matching parameters retaining infiltration (recharge) as an unknown parameter. The best fit numerical models points to a rather small annual recharge of the groundwater in the basin amounting to c.l% of the volume of the total annual precipitation (0.002km3/yr). The best fit basin model also predicts a somewhat smaller stream discharge (0.1Okm3/yr) than that observed. The difference can be interpreted in terms of change in storage and a discrepancy factor which might reflect the uncertainty in the observed total stream discharge. There is no evidence for any significant in- or outflow beneath the catchment boundaries. Most waters from groundwater wells in the Waihi Basin exhibit a very low mineralisation as shown by their average value of total dissolved solids (TDS) of c.110mg/kg. Significantly higher values (&gt;3,000mg/kg) occur only within and around the workings of the old Waihi Mine. The waters with low mineralisation can be classified as sodium-bicarbonate waters of low ionic strength. Despite the low strength, their cation ratios are controlled by fluid-rock interactions which fingerprint different types of volcanic host rocks (i.e. rhyolite, ignimbrite, andesite) and traces of distinct alteration minerals (i.e. kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite). The geochemical constituents in the groundwater vary throughout the year with silica sodium and TDS showing the smallest changes. Their concentration patterns across the whole basin points to the occurrence of slightly higher mineralized, dilute thermal waters in the axial and central part of the basin which discharge in a few wells as artesian flow with slightly elevated (a few degrees only) temperatures. Using a 2-D numerical simulation model, derived in part from the earlier numerical basin model, the associated advective flow of slightly heated deeper groundwater could be modelled using the near-surface discharge temperatures of artesian wells and their location as a matching parameter. It was found that a deep terrestrial heat flow of c.90mW/m2 is required to initiate convection and advective flow. This points to a deep basin temperature of c.118 degrees C at 2km depth. The best fit model points to a discharge centre not only in the basin centre but also to a smaller one lying outside the SE-basin divide. The probable sources for the anomalous terrestrial heat flow are most likely related to paleo-subduction and associated paleo-volcanic processes. The numerical models simulating the groundwater flow in the Waihi Basin also allow an assessment of the local groundwater anomaly caused by the pumping and dewatering of the Waihi open cast which started in 1990. The decline in waterlevel in the centre of the open pit in the old No.7 shaft was used as matching parameter in modelling the local groundwater flow around the mine. The actual pumping rates were poorly known and were treated as an unknown parameter. The best fit model provides extreme values for the pumping rates in 1997 with a mean of 60 &#177; 30 kg/s; this agrees with the actual mean annual pumping rates of c.55 kg/s for 1997 and allows the prediction that the deep piezometric level within the andesites around the mine has been depressed to mean sea level and affects an area within a radius of at least 0.5km around the centre of the open cast mine. The average hydraulic conductivities of the rocks within and beneath the cone of depression are also one order of magnitude lower than conductivities in adjacent blocks reflecting presumably the accumulated effects of older and present day blasting activities. The study has shown that detailed simulation of groundwater flow is required to understand the actual flow regimen of a groundwater basin even in an ideal setting such as the Waihi river basin.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confronting Barriers to Ecological Information Transfer in New Zealand's Fisheries Management System: Towards Developing a Trajectory for Trans-disciplinary Inquiry</field><field name="creator">Massey, Edwin John</field><field name="description">Confronting Barriers to Ecological Information Transfer in New Zealand's Fisheries Management system: Towards Developing a Trajectory for Trans-disciplinary Inquiry This thesis confronts barriers to ecological information transfer in New Zealand's fisheries management system. The investigation reveals a wider problematic within the governmental institutions of the fisheries milieu. The thesis deploys Callon's (1991) concept of translation to ask new questions regarding the conduct of fisheries science and management, which since the introduction of the Quota Management System in 1986, has been defined through the practices of commercial stakeholder groups. These stakeholders enrol ecological information through a narrowly defined and non-reflexive discourse of sustainable utilisation to serve specific purposes that suit their own needs. The thesis uses imaginaries to illustrate how sustainable utilisation has marginalised those stakeholders with different views on how ecological information could be used in fisheries management decision making. Moreover, the thesis contends that the milieu's hegemonic ontological environment prevents translation by mitigating the potential for dialogue between stakeholder groups. The thesis engages with a wide range of literature and cuts through established modes of thinking, developing a trans-disciplinary discourse that re-conceptualises the fisheries management problematic in process terms. The thesis demonstrates how trans-disciplinary dialogue that might transcend the current impasses in the New Zealand fisheries milieu will only develop through a network of previously unconnected groups. The thesis proposes a series of policy and behavioural interventions aimed at shifting the existing hierarchies of power and realigning established networks to ensure such dialogue is possible.

In the first of these, the images are transmitted via a serial optical link using phase only encoding and decoding of the image. This is achieved by encoding the image using a set of binary phase sequences and sending the sum of the field from all the pixels through the link. The image is reconstructed by first spatially separating the beam into output pixels and impressing phase sequences conjugate to those used to encode the image onto each pixel. Then the output pixels are combined with a coherent reference beam and the resulting intensities are averaged over the length of the sequences to recover the image. This method is discussed theoretically and it is shown that the number of image pixels able to be transmitted is limited by the dynamic range of the system. An experiment performed to demonstrate the principle of this technique is presented. This is done by transmitting a sixteen pixel image using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator to impart the phase sequences. Reasonably good image transmission is observed. In the second image transmission technique the image is sent directly through a multimode optical waveguide. In this method the amplitudes of the waveguide modes are matched to those of the image pixels by sampling the image correctly and performing an appropriate transform. At the output, the waveguide modes are spatially separated into discrete pixels with amplitudes proportional to those of the original image pixels. This is done by performing another transform and sampling appropriately. Image transmission through a perfectly reflecting slab waveguide and a dielectric slab waveguide is discussed theoretically. Experiments which demonstrate image transmission using this technique and highlight the difficulties encountered are also presented.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonmetrisable Manifolds</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Sina Ruth</field><field name="description">Nyikos has defined a tree, denoted T, associated with any given Type I space. This thesis examines the properties of an T-tree if the space is a Type I nonmetrisable manifold. It is shown that a tree, T, is an T-tree of a Type I manifold iff T is a well-pruned &#969;1-tree. Furthermore, if T is any well-pruned &#969;1-tree, there are 2N1 different Type I manifolds for which T is the T-tree. The relationships between the properties of a Type I manifold and the properties of its T-tree are examined. It is shown that whenever a Type I manifold contains a copy of &#969;1, its T-tree must contain an uncountable branch. The thesis then addresses the problem of whether or not an arbitrary tree T admits a Type I manifold which is &#969;1-compact. If T does not contain an uncountable antichain, or a Suslin subtree, then there exists a Type I manifold with T-tree T. If T contains an uncountable antichain, then whether there exists an &#969;1-compact Type I manifold with T-tree T is undecidable. (*) implies there does not exist such a tree while &#9674; implies that there does. If we assume &#9827;+, then at least one such manifold exists. &#9674; also implies that if T contains a Suslin subtree, then there exists an &#969;1-compact manifold with T-tree T. Nyikos has recently defined a Type II space. We may associate an T-tree with such a space. This thesis shows that a Tree, T, admits a Type II manifold iff T has height not greater than &#969;1, and each level has cardinality no greater than c. The final chapter examines the relationship between microbundles and fibre bundles over nonmetrisable manifolds. In 1964 Milnor defined the notion of a microbunble. He ceased developing the theory of microbundles when later in the same year Kister showed that a microbundle over a metrisable manifold is equivalent to a fibre bundle. This thesis proves that the tangent microbundle over a manifold is a fibre bundle iff the manifold is metrisable. As a consequence of this we obtain further properties equivalent to metrisability in a manifold.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulfur Compounds in the Environment</field><field name="creator">Li, Kwong Chi</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of osmium and ruthenium complexes with ligands featuring group 14 and 15 donor atoms</field><field name="creator">Woodgate, Scott Darren</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the preparation and chemistry of osmium and ruthenium complexes with ligands featuring the group 14 donor atoms carbon and silicon, and the group l5 donor atom phosphorus. Aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl complexes of osmium and ruthenium, prepared via mercury reagents, are discussed in Chapter One. 5-Coordinate 2-halophenyl complexes M(C6H4X-2)CI(CE)(PPh3)2 (M = Os; X = C1, Br; E = O, S; M = Os; X = I E = O; M = Ru; X = CI, Br, E = O) were synthesised by reaction of organomercury reagents Hg(C6H4X-2)2 (X = C1, I, Br) with MHC1(CO)(PPh3)3: (M = Os, Ru). Os(C6H4X-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os; X = C1, I, Br) were characterised structurally and the interaction between X and M examined. Attempted benzyne syntheses using these complexes were not successful. 6-Coordinate complexes M(C6H4X-2)C1(CO)(CE)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, X = C1, E = O, S; Br, E = O, S; M = Os, E = O, X = I; M = Ru, E = O, X = C1, Br) were prepared by the addition of carbon monoxide to the corresponding 5-coordinate precursors. Approaches towards reduction of these complexes are discussed. The structure of Os(C6H4C1-2)C1(CS)(CO)(PPh3)2 revealed that the thiocarbonyl and the aryl halide ligands were cis and therefore in an ideal geometry to rearrange and form a substituted thioacyl ligand. Indeed, on heating Os(C6H4X-2)C1(CS)(CO)(PPh3)2 (X = C1, Br) the corresponding thioacyl complexes Os(&#951;2-CS{C6H4X-2})C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (X = C1, Br) were formed. The decreased electron density in the halo aryl rings of these thioacyl complexes, combined with the fact that the halide substituents were no longer bonded to the metal, enabled facile lithiation of the aryl rings, even at low temperature. Quenching the appropriate lithiated intermediate with Bu3SnC1 gave Os(&#951;2-CS{C6H4SnBu3-2})C1(CO)(PPh3)2. These results suggested that M(C6H4{CH2X}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru) were worthwhile target complexes for lithiation studies. To this end, Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 was prepared but attempts to convert the alcohol into a tosylate (for subsequent reaction with LiX) were unsuccessful and so this chemistry was not pursued further. Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 transferred the benzylic alcohol groups to osmium and ruthenium, albeit in low yields. Oxidation of Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 with PCC provided the benzaldehyde-containing mercury complex Hg(C6H4{CHO}-2)C1, symmetrization of which gave Hg(C6H4{CHO}-2)2. The latter compound was used to prepare aldehyde complexes of osmium and ruthenium, as well as mercury(II) benzaldoxime and benzaldimines. The aldehyde oxygen atoms in the osmium and ruthenium complexes were bound to the metals and were unaffected by amines, and by attempts to displace them from the metals. The addition of dimethyldithiocarbamate to Ru(C6H4{CHO}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 displaced a triphenylphosphine ligand and Ru(C6H4{CHO}-2)(CO)({CH3}2NCS2)(PPh3) was formed. Transfer of the benzaldoxime ligand, and various benzaldimine ligands [C6H4{C[H]=NR] R = Me, CH2CH2NEt2, CH2CH2NMe2], to osmium or ruthenium gave M(C6H4{C[H]=NR}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Ru, R = OH; M = Os, Ru; R = Me, CH2CH2NEt2;M= Ru, R = CH2CH2NMe2). The derived cationic complexes Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NCH2CH2NHR2}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2]BF4 (R - Me, Et) were prepared by protonation of the benzaldimine complexes with HBF4+ and Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NCH2CH2NR2}-2)(Co)(PPh3)2]BF4(R = Me, Et)were prepared by addition of AgBF4. Bromination of Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NMe}-2)C1(Co)(PPh3)2 gave Ru(C6H3{C[H]=NMe}-2, Br-4)C1(Co)(PPh3)2 which was lithiated at low temperature. The aryllithium was quenched with Bu3SnC1 to give Ru(C6H3 { C[H]=NMe}-2,SnBu3-4)C1(CO)(PPh3)2. The reaction of alkynylmercury reagents with osmium and ruthenium complexes are discussed in the following sections. Treatment of RuHCI(CO)(PPh3)2 with Hg(C&#8801;CPh)2 has been reported previously, the result being formation of an &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand. However, the corresponding reaction with OsHCI(CO)(PPh3)3 resulted in catalysed coupling of the alkyne. This reaction was re-examined and the 6-coordinate &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl osmium complex was prepared by direct reaction of the 5-coordinate complex with acetate ion. A dicarbonyl complex containing the &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand, Os(C{C&#8801;Ph}=CHPh)CI(CO)2(PPh3)2, was prepared by the addition of carbon monoxide in the presence of LiC1 to the acetate complex. Thiocarbonyl complexes containing an &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand were prepared. Addition of carbon monoxide to solutions containing these complexes gave the thioacyl analogues M(&#951;2-CS{C[C&#8801;CPh]=CHPh})C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru). The remaining sections in Chapter One examine the reactions of mercury(II) reagents with the osmium(O) complexes Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 and OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3. Oxidative addition of the mercury-carbon bond of HgR2 (R = C6H4CH34, C&#8801;CPh, trans-CH=CHPh) to Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 gave OsR(HgR)(CO)2(PPh3)2. Reaction of the acetylide or styryl complexes with iodine resulted in cleavage of the osmium-mercury bond and yielded either Os(C&#8801;CPh)I(CO)2(PPh3)2 or Os(trans-CH=CHPh)I(CO)2(PPh3)2. Similar complexes were not accessible from reaction of the osmium(II) complex OsHC1(CO)(PPh3)3 with the appropriate mercury reagent. Whereas the mercury reagents reacted with Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 to give the simple oxidative addition products, the corresponding reactions of OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 with HgR2 did not always give the analogous products OsR(HgR)C1(NO)(PPh3)2. Addition of Hg(C6H4CH3-4)2 to OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 gave a mixture of the bis(p-tolyl) complex Os(C6H4CH3-4)2C1(NO)(PPh3)2 and the mono(p-tolyl) complex Os(C6H4CH3-4)CI2(NO)(PPh3)2. The structure of the bis(p-tolyl) complex revealed that the p-tolyl ligands were trans and the metal-carbon(aryl) bond lengths were extremely long. Addition of pyridine to the bis(p-tolyl) complex gave Os(C6H4CH3-4)2(C5H5N)CI(NO)(PPh3), which contained two cis p-tolyl ligands. The reactions of Hg(C6H4C1-2)2 and Hg(C&#8801;CPh)Ph with OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 gave complexes containing a single organic ligand. In contrast, treatment of OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 with either Hg({C4H4S-2})2 or Hg([C4H4SMe-5]-2})2 gave the dithienyl complexes OsR2CI(NO)(PPh3)2 [R = (C4H4S)-2, ({C4H4SMe-5})-2. Furthermore, the reaction of Hg(CF3)2 with OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 gave Os(CF3)(Hg{CF3})CI(NO)(PPh3)2. Treatment of OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 with Hg(trans-CH=CHPh)2 gave Os(trans-CH=CHPh)CI2(NO)(PPh3)2 and an osmaindene complex, Os(C6H4CH=CH)H(NO)(PPh3)2, which in turn gave Os(C6H4CH=CH)Cl(No)(PPh3)2 on treatment with HCl. Chapter Two examines osmabenzene chemistry. Spectroscopic data were collected for the known complexes Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, and Os(C[SH]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-CI)(CO)(PPh3)2. Oxidation of the osmabenzene thiol to a sulfinic acid was attempted. Methylation of the parent complex, Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, gave the product of kinetic control as Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(CO)(PPh3)2, reported previously, which rearranged on heating to give the trans isomer, Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(trans-I)(CO)(PPh3)2. Approaches to auration of the sulphur in Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, are described. Although the metallabenzenes reported previously have physical properties comparable with those of benzene itself, little evidence has been reported to suggest that the chemical reactivity of metallabenzenes is similar to that of benzene. The research described in this chapter provides the first example of a metallabenzene complex that undergoes aromatic electrophilic substitution. Thus, the metallabenzene complex Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(Co)(PPh3)2was brominated, chlorinated, and even iodinated. Crystal structure determinations and NMR studies showed that C5, which was activated by the thioether functionality, was the preferred site of electrophile attack. Even more significantly, Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(Co)(PPh3)2 was nitrated with either Cu(NO3)2/acetic anhydride, or with the more potent reagent NO2CF3SO3.CF3SO3H. The site of nitration was identical with that of halogenation, namely, C5. Previous syntheses of metallabenzenes had reported the use of the simplest alkyne, ethyne. This chapter describes the first metallabenzene complex prepared from propyne, giving the metallabenzene Os(&#951;2-C[S]C{CH3}=CHCH=C{CH3})(CO)(PPh3)2 and the oxidative addition product Os(C&#8801;CCH3)H(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2. Ten of the metallabenzene complexes were characterised structurally and the significance of the carbon-carbon bond lengths in the metallacyclic rings are discussed. The complete characterisation of these complexes by NMR spectroscopy revealed that the ring protons in the metallabenzene complexes, excepting H6, were at chemical shifts similar to those expected for normal aromatic carbons. Chapter Three examines the coordination of the strongly &#1495;-accepting tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand to osmium. Two tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine complexes of Os(II), OsHCI(CO)(PPh3)2(P{NC4H4}3) and OsH(C6H4CH3-4)(CO)(PPh3)2(P{NC4H4}3), were prepared. Both of these showed significantly higher infrared carbonyl stretching absorptions than the analogous triphenylphosphine complexes, reflecting the &#1495;-acceptor nature of the tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand. The osmium(O) complexes Os(CE)(CO)(PPh3)2P(NC4H4)3 (E = O, S) were prepared and the carbonyl complex was characterised structurally. The osmium-phosphorus(pyrrolyl) bond length of this complex was relatively short. The tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand was in the equatorial plane as were the two carbonyl ligands. Chapter Four examines silyl and siloxane complexes of osmium and ruthenium. Although triethoxysilyl complexes of ruthenium have been prepared previously through ethanolysis of the coordinated SiCl3 group, the osmium analogues could not be prepared this way. It was found that Os(Si{OEt}3)CI(CO)(PPh3)2 could be prepared successfully by direct treatment of Os(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with triethoxysilane. Addition of carbon monoxide to the 5-coordinate triethoxysilyl complex afforded the dicarbonyl complex. The triethoxysilyl nitrosyl complex, OsH(Si{OEt}3)CI(NO)(PPh3)2, was prepared by oxidative addition of triethoxysilane to OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3, and the siloxane nitrosyl complex, Os(O[Si{OEt}3])CI2(NO)(PPh3 )2 was also characterised fully. Prior to this work only a single silatranyl complex was known. This chapter reports fifteen new silatranyl complexes and examines the unique properties conferred upon the silatrane by coordination to the metal. The silatranyl-containing complexes OsH(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(No)(pph3)2 and OsH(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)(CO)2(pph3)2 were formed by oxidative addition of silatrane to the appropriate osmium(O) complex. Neither was suitable for further research because the chloro nitrosyl complex ejected silatrane in the presence of oxygen, and the dicarbonyl complex was isolated as a mixture of three isomers. In contrast, the unsaturated complexes M(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru) were excellent materials for further study. The crystal structures of both of these complexes reveal typical metal-silyl distances with atypical silatranyl N&#8594;Si bond lengths. In both cases the N&#8594;Si bond length is elongated, the nitrogen is planar, and the cage is best described as quasi-silatranyl. The unsaturated nature of the metal in Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(CO)(PPh3)2 offered access to derived complexes. The &#1495;-acid carbon monoxide added to the vacant site forming Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)C1(co)2(pph3)2. Methylation of the 5-coordinate silatranyl complexes, gave [M(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)CI(CO)(PPh3)2]CF3SO3(M = Os, Ru). This reaction has not been achieved previously for silatrane derivatives. These methylated complexes have the longest recorded N&#8594;Si distances for any silatrane derivatives, and display a tetrahedral bridgehead nitrogen which points out of the cage at the methyl substituent. Protonation of the 5-coordinate silatranyl complexes gave [M(Si{OCH2CH2}3NH)CI(CO)(PPh3)2]CF3SO3 (M = Os, Ru). The thiocarbonyl-containing derivatives Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(CS)(PPh3)2 and [Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)CI(CS)(PPh3)2]CF3S03 were prepared and these complexes showed spectroscopic properties similar to those observed for the carbonyl-containing analogues. The 5-coordinate silatranyl-thiocarbonyl complex rearranged in the presence of carbon monoxide to form Os(&#951;2-C{S}Si{OCH2CH2}3N))CI(CO)(PPh3)2, which did not contain a metal-silicon bond. The silatranyl cage in the structure of this complex showed a very short N&#8594;Si bond with the nitrogen centre tetrahedral and pointing into the cage and towards the silicon atom. The osmium(IV) complex OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)(pph3)2 was prepared from OsH4(PPh3)2 and silatrane. The structure of this complex showed that the hydride ligands were oriented trans to a single triphenylphosphine in each case. Treatment of this complex with methyl iodide gave the quaternary salt [OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)(PPh3)3]I, and protonation gave [OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3NH)(PPh3)3]CF3SO3.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building Institutions for Sustainability: A New Zealand Case Study</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Stephen Peter</field><field name="description">One of the most important challenges facing Western capitalist societies at the beginning of the 21st century is how to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental futures. The successful translation of the principles underpinning sustainability into concrete outcomes is dependent on the institutional context within which political contests over alternative futures take place. It is as important to build an institutional fabric that preserves sustainability options for future generations as preserving the environment itself. The importance of aligning juridical-political institutions with the principles of sustainability has become embedded in international political agreements, global action plans such as Agenda 21 and national and international policy discourses. Yet little attention has been paid to investigating the impact of juridical-political institutions on the achievement of sustainable futures let alone implementing these recommendations. Between 1984 and 1991 New Zealand actively reconfigured its juridical-political environmental institutional fabric. The reform process was driven by a desire to create a new market based long wave of economic growth and to actively incorporate the principles underpinning sustainability into the juridical-political institutional fabric. The reforms involved the restructuring of the national state's environmental bureaucracy, the reorganisation of regional and local government and a comprehensive review of environmental and planning legislation that resulted in the enactment of the Resource Management Act l99l (RMA). This dissertation aims to test common assumptions about the importance of juridical-political change for sustainability. It investigates the extent to which juridical-political institutions help to secure sustainable outcomes drawing on a geographically inspired, theoretically informed investigation into recent attempts to manage the water quality of New Zealand's largest lake, Lake Taupo. The dissertation argues that juridical-political institutions for sustainability have a regulatory role and a governance role. In the former instance, they attempt to redefine the relationship between economy, society and environment in a manner that supports continued capitalist accumulation. In the latter instance, they establish the rules within which particular contests over environmental futures are fought. The precise outcome of contests over the environment depends on the complex interaction of institutions, material factors, actors, strategies and discourses. Juridical-political institutional change may help to steer society towards sustainability. It does not, however, guarantee sustainable outcomes. While it is important to build juridical-political institutions that incorporate the principles underpinning sustainability the process of achieving sustainability requires also requires reflexive political action and value change through society. Key words: juridical-political institutions, sustainability, regulation, governance, water resource management, New Zealand, Resource Management Act 1991.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible Mixed Models: Regression Splines and Thin-Plate Regression Splines in a Mixed Model Framework</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Monique L.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser pyrolysis of selected halogenated compounds with W(CO)6</field><field name="creator">Allen, Grant Richard</field><field name="description">The pyrolysis of selected halogenated compounds in the absence and presence of W(CO)6 has been investigated using infrared laser powered homogeneous pyrolysis (IR LPHP). The chemistry of these compounds in the absence of W(CO)6 is dominated by the themes of dehydrohalogenation (where available) and C&#8211;X bond homolysis (where X = halogen). The pyrolysis of W(CO)6 in the gas phase at moderate temperatures leads to unsaturated W(CO)x species; these prove to be very effective and selective abstractors of Cl and Br atoms from the selected halogenated compounds. The subsequent chemistry is dominated by the resulting organic radical moiety; observed end products are ascribed to disproportionation, combination, addition, rearrangement, abstraction and fragmentation of this species. The results pertaining to the pyrolysis of several of the oxygen-containing halogenated compounds in the presence of W(CO)6 suggest that unsaturated W(CO)x species are also effective abstractors of atomic oxygen. A number of the products observed can be attributed to intramolecular insertion of the resulting divalent carbon.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A prospective investigation of cognitive-behavioural models of irritable bowel and chronic fatigue syndromes: implications for theory, classification and treatment</field><field name="creator">Spence, Meagan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the application of the cognitivebehavioural model to two common functional somatic syndromes: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A range of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating variables operationalised from this model were assessed in two acutely ill samples. The significance and relative importance of these variables with regard to the development of post-infectious IBS and CFS were then examined. At the same time, information was gathered to assess the appropriateness of an overall conceptualisation for the functional somatic syndromes. Similarities and differences between the two syndromes were investigated, and the impact of differing thresholds and disability criteria were compared to determine the utility of current diagnostic criteria. Patients with a positive laboratory test result for Campylobacter gastroenteritis or glandular fever were recruited through general practitioners. A total of 1018 participants completed a baseline questionnaire at the time of infection which included measures of anxiety, depression, perfectionism, somatisation, perceived stress, acute illness perceptions and illness related behaviours. Those previously diagnosed with CFS or IBS were excluded, along with participants experiencing any medical condition known to impact on fatigue levels or bowel function (n=183). Participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three (93% response rate) and six months (90% response rate) post-infection. At each point, cases of IBS and CFS were identified using published diagnostic criteria. Results indicated that a range of cognitive, behavioural, physiological and emotional variables were significantly related to the development of both IBS and CFS. Whilst there were some similarities between the two conditions, there were also some key differences. Depression and somatisation were significant predisposing variables in the development of CFS, but not IBS, for which anxiety was a key predictor. Perceived stress and the type of acute infection were more important as precipitants of IBS than CFS. Campylobacter was a significant predictor of IBS at both timepoints, whilst the presence of this illness type also strengthened the association between IBS and the psychological variables. In contrast, glandular fever was a significant predictor of CFS at three months only, and this iii association was outweighed by the inclusion of the psychological variables. With regard to perpetuating factors, negative illness perceptions at the time of acute infection were significantly related to both conditions, and all-or-nothing behaviour was also associated with IBS. When CFS and IBS cases at six month follow-up were compared, CFS cases had higher levels of disability, but not health care utilisation. Finally, when subthreshold cases of IBS and CFS were compared to their diagnosed counterparts, on the whole they did not differ with regard to the psychological risk factors, disability or health care utilisation. These results support the application of the cognitive-behavioural model to IBS and CFS as a useful explanatory tool and guide for treatment. The results provide a degree of empirical detail that has previously been lacking with regard to these models. Comparing the application of the model to two separate conditions has demonstrated subtle but important differences between the development of post-infectious IBS and CFS. These findings suggest that an overall conceptualisation for the functional somatic syndromes may not be capable of determining and addressing such differences for individual conditions. With regard to the diagnostic criteria for IBS and CFS, results suggest that the current criteria may be unnecessarily restrictive and complex. Simplification or the formalised addition of subthreshold conditions may result in more widespread usage and clinical applicability of these criteria.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical and Institutional Challenges to Management of Dairy Shed Effluent and Stream Management Practices on New Zealand Dairy Farms</field><field name="creator">Blackett, Paula Elizabeth</field><field name="description">New Zealand dairy farmers have been accused in a national 'dirty dairying' campaign of 'selfishly destroying the community's natural water resources' (Fish &amp; Game 2001, pg l) through a combination of point and diffuse source pollution and habitat modification. The dirty dairying debate in response to Fish &amp; Game's campaign is about the conflicts that arise through differing values of rural water resources in New Zealand. That farming practices affect freshwater ecosystems is broadly recognised but poorly understood. The problems encountered in New Zealand's dairy sector, however, are exacerbated by the nature of relationships between dairy industry actors, gaps in information and provision of environmental advice to farmers. This thesis examines aspects of the debate through scientific and social frameworks using three strongly interrelated investigations situated in the laboratory, field and social environment. Each investigation adds further levels of complexity providing potential biophysical solutions as well as insights into the challenges facing those seeking to manage the effects of dairy farming practices. Investigations focused mainly on dairy effluent and stream ecology in the Waikato and Taranaki areas. The research showed that both dairy shed effluent (DSE) dilution in stream flow and stream management practices, particularly riparian shading, were important in reducing the effects of discharges to stony stream communities. In some situations, diffuse inputs from stream management practices had already degraded stream communities, making them less sensitive to discharges. However, significant adverse effects on stream benthic invertebrates were observed for oxidation pond discharges at 338-fold and below, but not at 1000-fold dilution. Significant improvements in rural water and habitat quality are unlikely to be achieved under the regulatory regime in place at the time of the interviews carried out in this research. DSE discharges are controlled through statutory regulation, but in many cases the permitted dilution rates are too low. Controls on diffuse pollution and habitat modification are voluntary, and undertaken by some farmers. Improvements in rural water and habitat quality are constrained by a lack of clear understanding by farmers on the importance of DSE treatment and stream management practices and a lack of impetus to act. Contributing to this is limited availability, transfer and often misalignment of information between dairy industry actors involved in environmental management. However, enhanced information provision alone is unlikely to lead to improved rural water and habitat quality and Fonterra's Clean Stream Accord (May 2003), while contentious, represents a potentially effective way forward for stream management in New Zealand. Success of this Accord depends on all dairy industry actors (including farmers) working together and combining their strengths in order to generate useful, practical information and solutions to achieve improvements in rural water and habitat quality.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invasion ecology and genetics of Norway rats on New Zealand islands</field><field name="creator">Russell, James</field><field name="description">Introduced rats have invaded over 80% of the world&#8217;s oceanic island groups, with devastating consequences for the endemic biota. Techniques developed in New Zealand allow rats to be eradicated from very large islands, enabling conservation of biodiversity. However even when rats have been eradicated, it is possible that they can reinvade islands. Current scientific and technological methods have failed markedly in preventing reinvasion. It is unknown why difficulties in preventing reinvasion are encountered, but it has been postulated that this is due to a change in behaviour at low density that has management implications. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are particularly adept island invaders, due to their propensity to swim, and so experimental releases of of adult male Norway rats on to small forested rat-free islands in northern New Zealand were used to study the behaviour of invading rats and assess management methods. Currently management of islands to prevent reinvasion is undertaken without a standard framework or knowledge of the suitability of many control devices. Without testing devices under realistic field trials of single invading rats, it can not be guaranteed that they will successfully prevent reinvasion. Permanent island biosecurity systems performed better than contingency responses which evoked enhanced neophobia in invading rats. Invading rats were reluctant to interact with any artificial devices, particularly bait stations. An integrated approach using multiple devices including traps, poisons and trained rodent dogs was consistently the best approach to detect and eliminate invading rats, which can have high individual variability in behaviour. When animals arrive in a novel environment their behaviour will change, with particular focus on spatial exploration in order to acquire a cognitive representation of their new environment. Rats usually remained around release sites for three days, changing den site often, before establishing a stable den site and exploring the entirety of small islands in the first week. Prevailing nightly ranges were between 0 &#8211; 5 hectares, with at least 35% of any given nightly range not having been visited the previous night. Nightly ranges were constrained by den sites, which acted as central foraging locations. Invading rats could move over a kilometre in one night. A recent island invasion was used to collect samples of an invading Norway rat population prior to its eradication. Studies of small populations with only a single opportunity to collect specimens result in sparse data. Population genetic methods provide additional information which can be used in investigating a population. The effective population size is one such population biology summary parameter, and data on linkage disequilbrium can be used from a single sample to estimate effective population size. Simulated populations were used to assess the precision and accuracy of the estimator relative to true demographic values. Recent trends in census population size, as well as the mating system and sample size relative to effective population size, all have substantial effects on the bias of the estimate. It remains unclear how invasive species overcome bottlenecks from colonisation. Ecological and genetic methods were used to investigate a recently colonised small island population of Norway rats. Multiple genetic methods all detected a clear bottleneck signal, and parentage assignment revealed a promiscuous mating system. Norway rats are highly capable invaders of islands who have evolved life-history strategies allowing them to rapidly establish a large population, Recommendations are finally made for island biosecurity to prevent rat invasion. These recommendations are based upon consideration of dispersal and invasion rates, and methods of detection and prevention. If island biosecurity is conducted regularly with proven tools, it should be possible to maintain large islands free of rats even when a high invasion rate is present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">White Light Feedback Interferometry for Aberration Correction, and Near-Real-Time Phase-Difference Amplification</field><field name="creator">Bold, Geoffrey Terence</field><field name="description">There has recently been much interest in the use of adaptive optics systems for automatic aberration correction in applications such as astronomical and line-of-sight imaging. The background of aberration correction is presented, reviewing applications of adaptive optics systems, and commonly used wavefront sensing and correcting techniques. Aberration correction systems use a variety of correction elements including liquid crystal devices and segmented mirrors. Clearly, characteristics such as response time, phase vs. drive voltage, and sensitivity to wavelength and polarisation state of input light are important to system performance. The characteristics of two liquid crystal spatial light modulators, pertinent to aberration correction, are initially investigated. Research on a novel white light feedback interferometric technique that can be used for aberration correction is then presented. Using this technique, a phase proportional to the interferometer output intensity is applied to a modulator within the interferometer to achieve automatic phase correction. The interferometer operates in white light. A theoretical analysis of white light feedback interferometry is given along with simulated and experimental results. The results show that aberration correction can, in principle, be achieved using the technique. Liquid crystal spatial light modulators suffer from relatively slow response times and a limited phase modulation range. Segmented mirrors have much faster response times, and a much larger phase modulation range, but are prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we decided to construct a 3x3 segmented mirror for use in aberration correction systems. The construction, testing, housing and mounting of the segmented mirror purpose built for aberration correction is then discussed. Phase-difference amplification is a technique that can be used for high accuracy phase measurement. Using this technique a diffraction grating is constructed using the interferogram of a test wavefront. The &#177;n orders diffracted from the grating are interfered together to form a phase-amplified interferogram from which a phase map of the test wavefront can be recovered. In the future, phase-difference amplification may be a very useful technique for aberration correction systems. Conventional systems use time consuming and inconvenient photographic techniques to construct the grating. The second part of this thesis describes several phase-difference amplification systems where the diffraction grating is written on a liquid crystal spatial light modulator. The liquid crystal devices, which have a high resolution and much faster response times than the photographic development time, make the systems convenient and allow near-real-time operation. A phase map of the test object is retrieved using phase stepping techniques. Experimental results for each system are presented and compared. They show that amplification factors of up to 6 are easily achievable.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Towards Antibiotics Containing Phthalide Moieties</field><field name="creator">Sidford, Matthew</field><field name="description">An investigation into the synthesis of several analogues of antifungal agents related to the papulacandins was undertaken. Retrosynthetic analysis of these analogues identified phthalide (261) and allylstannane (278) as key intermediates in the synthesis of analogues of type (284). The key step in the synthesis of phthalide (261) was the ortho formylation via ortholithiation of amide (255). The synthesis of phthalide (261) was carried out over five steps in 35% overall yield from (255). Synthesis of the allylstannane intermediate from alcohol (351) proved problematic thus preventing further progress in this area of research. Synthetic studies toward the anti-helicobactericidal phthalides CJ-12,954 (56), CJ-13,014 (57), CJ-13,015 (58), CJ-13,0102 (59), CJ-13,103 (60), CJ-13,104 (61), and CJ-13,108 (62) were undertaken. CJ-12,954 (56) and CJ-13,108 (62) were chosen as initial targets. Retrosynthetic analysis identified phthalide (288), spiroketal ylide (297) and ylide (468) as key intermediates for the synthesis of the natural products (56) and (62). The synthesis of spiroketal epoxide (300) was successfully achieved in fifteen steps starting from materials (386) and (381) in an overall yield of 87o. Unfortunately all attempts to effect ring opening of epoxide (300) were unsuccessful. The racemic synthesis of phthalide (288) was carried out in six steps starting from material 2,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (296) in 33% overall yield. Wittig coupling of ylide (468) with phthalide (288) allowed complete total synthesis of racemic CJ-13,108 (62) from (288) in 42% overall yield.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic and Conductivity Studies of Doping in Polythiophene and Poly(3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene) and their Applications as Gas Sensors</field><field name="creator">Chiu, William Wen-Chao</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand Ascidians: Masters of Amino Acid-Derived Secondary Metabolites</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Allison Norrie</field><field name="description">A survey of 34 New Zealand ascidians was performed for the purpose of investigating the biological and chemical properties of ascidians from New Zealand waters. The crude extracts were assayed for biological activity and were also analyzed by HPLC with photodiode array capability for comparison of absorption spectra. In this manner, biological profiles of the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activities of the crude extracts were obtained, as well as a UV metabolic profile. The (-)-enantiomer of the known compound 1,2,3-trithiane was isolated from the ascidian Hypsistozoa fasmeriana, and the (+)-enantiomer from the ascidian Distaplia stylifera, a member of the same family (Holozoidiae). The (+)-enantiomer was originally isolated from the New Zealand ascidian Aplidium sp.D and appears to be unique to New Zealand waters. A new class of compound, the fasmerianamines A and B, derivatives of 1,2,3-trithiane, were isolate from a second collection of Hypsistozoa fasmeriana. Another new class of metabolite, the fluorescent, biologically inactive distomadines A and B were discovered in the ascidian Pseudodistoma aureum. A previously unknown trimethylated purine, N2,N2,7-trimethylguanine as well as other known purine bases were detected and isolated. Much of the biological activity of the ascidian extracts could be attributed to the presence of unsaturated long-chain amino alcohol-type compounds. The presence of the pyridoacridine class of compound, a large class of aromatic polycyclic alkaloids of worldwide distribution, was detected in a New Zealand ascidian for the first time. The pyridoacridone alkaloid ascididemin possesses a wide range of biological activity and progressed as far as in vivo xenograft antitumoural assays at the NCI, in addition to exhibiting potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, revealing its value as a lead compound. The antitumoural activity of ascididemin is attributed to the intercalative ability of its planar pentacyclic structure. The synthetic strategy for another natural pyridoacridone, kuanoniamine A was optimized, and the synthetic compound also showed not only good human solid tumour selectivity, progressing as far as in vivo hollow fibre testing at the NCI, but also potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Three other synthetic ring A-modified analogues were prepared. Two, combining either a furan or a thiophene A ring with a carboxylic acid methyl ester substituent in position two on ring A, were tested at the NCI and were found to be inactive. This indicated that the carboxylic acid methyl ester substituent modification had a detrimental effect on cytotoxicity. The disruption of the planarity of the heterocyclic ring system with subsequent inability to intercalate into DNA might be a factor. An isoxazole ring A-modified analogue was found to be too unstable for evaluation purposes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deuteron polarization in the Be9(pd)Be8 reaction</field><field name="creator">Robinson, David Cameron</field><field name="description">A theoretical analysis of the Be9(pd)Be8 reaction at a proton energy of 333kev assuming compound nucleus formation of a 1- state in B10 predicts that if protons are unpolarised the deuterons have zero vector but maximum possible tensor polarisation i.e. the magnetic substate population ration is 1:0:1 and Pzz =1. furthermore it predicts that both the polarization and the angular distribution of these deutrerons are isotropic.

With a continual decline in the abundance of whitebait species, additional knowledge on factors affecting galaxiid populations is crucial. This thesis examines the use of olfactory and lateral line sensory systems in the biology of banded kokopu as both adults and juveniles (whitebait). The feeding biology of banded kokopu adults was investigated through olfactory source localisation. In the presence of a 2 cm s-1 current flow, fish used both olfaction and the superficial neuromasts of the lateral line system to locate the food source. A physical block of one olfactory nostril did not affect the olfactory search strategy employed by banded kokopu. Banded kokopu whitebait were tested for their response to adult galaxiid odours. Migratory whitebait exhibited a species-specific attraction to adult conspecifics. There was no response shown to odours from adults of other galaxiid species, the inanga (G. maculatus) or koaro (G. brevipinnis) at any concentration tested. This pheromonal attraction may play an important role in habitat selection during migration. The effect of poor water quality on sensory performance was also investigated. After exposure to 0.5 &#181;g Cd2+ l-l for 48 hours, the attraction to adult pheromones had been eliminated, indicating this level of cadmium exposure had impaired olfactory function. The lateral line system was not blocked until a concentration of 2 &#181;g Cd2+l-1. Whitebait were also tested for a preference/avoidance response at2 &#181;g Cd2+ l-l and showed neither a preference for, or an avoidance of, a concentration which would disable both the lateral line and olfactory sensory systems. This concentration is within the current water quality criteria for protection of aquatic life. The disabling of these sensory systems may render migratory cues undetectable, affecting habitat selection by whitebait, which may ultimately affect the distribution of banded kokopu populations. This thesis furthers our understanding of the mechanisms of migration and feeding in banded kokopu. The use of both the lateral line and olfactory sensory systems in the location of food odours by adult fish provides the first demonstration of the use of the lateral line system in olfactory source localisation in fish. The importance of water quality in the detection of possible migratory cues has been illustrated with cadmium, where inhibition of sensory systems rendered pheromonal cues undetectable. The pheromonal attraction exhibited by whitebait to adults provides a possible migratory cue used by whitebait in locating habitat for colonisation. The identification of a migratory cue could help in the conservation of banded kokopu populations and in the management of New Zealand's whitebait fishery.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intermolecular interactions in aqueous binary mixtures of non-electrolytes</field><field name="creator">Keronei, Pius Kipkemboi</field><field name="description">The density and shear viscosity of mixtures of tert-Butyl alcohol (ButOH) and tert-Butylamine (ButNH2) with water have been determined for various temperatures (288.15 K to 318.15 K for H2O+ButOH and 288.15 K to 308.15 K for H2O+ButNH2) over the whole composition range. Excess molar volumes and apparent molar volumes of the components of each system were calculated from the density data. In both systems the apparent molar volume of the organic component passes through a minimum in the water-rich region. Both systems exhibit large negative excess molar volumes which are essentially independent of temperature at all compositions. The two systems show pronounced maxima in their shear viscosity isotherms. The empirical solvent polarity parameters ENR and ET for the solvatochromic compounds Nile Red and pyridinium-N-phenoxide betaine respectively, have been determined as a function of composition for water + tert-Butyl alcohol and water + tert-Butylamine binary mixtures, over the whole composition range at 298.15 K. For both systems the two parameters vary with composition in a strongly nonlinear fashion, and the polarity of the mixture decreases with increasing proportion of the organic cosolvent. The nonlinear variation of the polarity parameters is attributed to water-cosolvent hydrophobic interactions at low cosolvent contents, and hydrogen bonding interactions at higher cosolvent contents. Permittivity and refractive index have also been measured at 298.15 K for both systems, and both properties are strongly nonlinear functions of composition. The self-diffusion coefficients of water and of the organic component have been measured for H2O+t-butyl alcohol and H2O+t-butylamine mixtures over the whole composition range at 301.15 K, using the NMR spin-echo technique. In the water-rich region below 20 mole % of cosolvent, the self-diffusion coefficients of both components for each binary solvent system decrease rapidly with increasing cosolvent content. In cosolvent-rich mixtures with more than 50 mole % cosolvent, motions of water are evidently strongly correlated with those of cosolvent molecules. The semiempirical equation proposed by Albright relating the shear viscosity of a mixture to the diffusion coefficients of its components successfully predicts the general shape of the viscosity curve for each binary system. For the composition region above 50 mole % cosolvent the Albright equation gives calculated viscosities which agree well with observed values, but in the water-rich region there are significant deviations between the observed and calculated viscosities. Volume ratios have been measured with a bellows volumometer for t-Butylamine and six water + t-Butylamine mixtures at 278.15, 288.15, 298.15 and 313.15 K, at pressures up to about 200 MPa or at a lower pressure slightly below the freezing pressure at the temperature of measurement. From densities measured at 0.1 MPa together with the volume ratios at higher pressures, excess molar volumes, and isothermal compressibilities have been evaluated. The compressibility is a relatively simple function of pressure, temperature, and composition. Hydroxyl-proton chemical shifts for water and t-Butyl alcohol in water + t-Butyl alcohol mixtures with &#8805;8 mol% t-Butyl alcohol, and the averaged hydroxyl and amino proton chemical shift for water + t-Butylamine mixtures, have been determined at 200 MHz for four temperatures (263.15, 278.15, 298.15 and 313.15 K) as a function of composition. Further measurements have been made for water + t-Butyl alcohol + t-Butylamine ternary mixtures at 310.15 K over the complete mole fraction range at 60 MHz. Variations in solvent composition have little effect on the resonance for the methyl protons of the cosolvent, but the signal for the hydroxylic protons is substantially influenced. The water proton resonance initially shifts to higher frequencies (low fields) as the cosolvent is added to water, and the shift to higher frequency in the water proton resonance induced by the hydrophobic cosolvent is strongly temperature dependent, the effect being greatly enhanced at lower temperatures. As the proportion of cosolvent increases the hydroxyl proton signals in the water + t-Butyl alcohol system and the averaged proton signal in water + t-Butylamine mixtures shift to lower frequency (high field). Raman and FT-IR absorption spectra of aqueous t-Butyl alcohol and t-Butylamine in the region of O-H and NH2 stretching and bending modes have been measured at 298.15 K as a function of organic cosolvent concentration in the whole cosolvent mole fraction region. Vibrational intensities of some bands show definite trends with varying concentrations of the solutions. In the concentration dependence study unusual linewidth changes of certain bands were observed. Conductivities, densities and viscosity B-coefficients from the Jones-Dole equation were determined for NaI, KI, Bu4NI, LiCl and KCl at 298.15 K in various mixtures of water with t-Butyl alcohol and t-Butylamine. The limiting molar conductances and the corresponding Walden products have been computed. Values of the partial molar volumes of the electrolytes at infinite dilution in the various solvent mixtures were obtained from the density measurements.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Studies of Wave Propagation in Sea-Ice</field><field name="creator">Chung, Hyuck</field><field name="description">This thesis presents mathematical studies of wave propagation at the surface of the ocean covered with sea-ice sheets. During the winter months the sea around the coast of Antarctica freezes to form a vast area of ice covered region. The ice sheets found in this area are often large and apparently featureless. From these properties, a large scale sea-ice sheet has been modelled as a homogeneous thin elastic plate with a constant Young's modulus when the deformation of the ice sheet is small. A partial differential equation describing the motion of an ice sheet is de-rived from the classical theory of linear elasticity. A well known system of partial differential equations is derived to describe the vertical deflection of a thin elastic plate coupled with a linearized Bernoulli's equation at the surface and Laplace's equation for incompressible fluid of finite depth. The Fourier transform is used to derive the vertical deflection of the ice sheet when a localized time harmonic vertical load is applied. A fundamental solution can be expressed by infinite summations of fractional functions at complex roots of the dispersion equation. The inverse Fourier transform is calculated by hand using the Hankel transform and the resulting formulae are directly turned into numerically stable computer codes without any modification. It is shown from the finite water depth solution, that the infinite series expansion of the deflection can be reduced to a sum of special functions whose modes are three roots of a fifth order polynomial. Furthermore, the space and time variables are non-dimensionalized using a characteristic length and characteristic time which are determined by the thickness and Young's modulus of the ice sheet. As a consequence of the non-dimensionalization, the solutions are insensitive to the ice thickness and categorized according to distinctive physical characteristics. It is conversely shown that the characteristic length and characteristic time can be measured from direct observations of the flexural motion, such as the surface strain or tilt, of the ice sheet. Interaction between two semi-infinite ice sheets that are joined by a straight infinite line transition is considered. When a plane wave is obliquely incident on the transition, reflection and transmission of wave energy occurs. Analytical formulae for the coefficients of a modal expansion of the waves in the ice sheet are derived using the Wiener-Hopf technique and formulae for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the surface waves are also presented. The formulae are directly turned into stable computer codes. The application of the Wiener-Hopf technique given here is modified from a standard method to accommodate the incident wave from infinity better. A set of physical conditions at the transition can be expressed using a pair of 4 x 4 matrix and 4-element vector, whose elements are computed from the coefficients of the modal expansion of the solutions. Hence the solution procedure is able to cope with various transition conditions simply by changing the matrix and the vector. Modelling of finite ice sheets using the boundary integral equation method is also considered. Formulation of boundary integral equations is given and it is shown that the dynamics of the ice sheet is represented by the boundary integrals only on the edge of the ice sheet. Connection between the Wiener-Hopf technique and boundary integral method is made.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to cross borders: everyday urban encounters between South Korea and Auckland</field><field name="creator">Collins, Francis Leo</field><field name="description">This thesis examines aspects of emergent transnational mobility within the experience of students advancing their education at tertiary institutions, private training establishments and language schools. In particular it focuses on the everyday practices and experiences of one group of international students from South Korea during their time in Auckland, New Zealand. The context for the research is that over the last decade the growth of international students and the institutions associated with their movement and education have begun to have significant economic, social and cultural implications in New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. Here, the rapid increase in the number and proportion of students from three East-Asian nations (China, South Korea and Japan) has contributed to profound changes in the socio-cultural geographies of Auckland&#8217;s central city.  The aim of this study is to interrogate the everyday urban encounters of South Korean international students as a means to more deeply understand the phenomenon of crossing borders to learn. I employ a multi-method and multi-sited research approach that draws on both orthodox and emergent techniques within human geography and related social sciences. Through these methods I focus on the individual and collective practices and experiences of these students as key actors in the developments associated with international education. At all times the focus is on &#8216;the everyday&#8217; and the ways in which students negotiate their encounters between South Korea and Auckland. In theoretical terms the thesis is situated at the border between the study of transnationalism and the study of cities. It identifies the ways that the transnational mobility and activity of students alongside others is involved in the changing spaces of Auckland&#8217;s urban landscape. These changed spaces include physical, economic, sensory and perceptual landscapes of the city. In addition the thesis also illustrates the concurrent production, maintenance and resistance of pre-existing and new identities; the often difficult, highly structured and uneven landscape that emerges as a result of the interaction between individuals and groups who consider each-other &#8216;foreign&#8217;; and the way that these types of interactions in contemporary cities are facilitated by but also maintain and produce increasing transnationalism. The thesis concludes by illustrating the fundamental role that cities play in the practice of international education and the resulting importance of international education to the everyday realities of contemporary cities like Auckland.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International Education</field><field name="subject">International Students</field><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Transnationalism</field><field name="subject">South Korea</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyelectrolyte Copolymer Hydrogels: Synthesis, Characterisation and Drug Delivery System Based on 2-Acrylamido-2-Methyl-1-Propane Sulphonic Acid</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Chi</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular trafficking of rotavirus NSP4 in epithelial cells</field><field name="creator">Bugarc&#780;ic&#769;, Andrea</field><field name="description">Rotavirus is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus that belongs to the family Reoviridae and is associated with severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children throughout the world. Rotavirus targets the fully differentiated epithelial cells lining the tips of the small intestinal villi. Although different aspects of the rotavirus replication cycle have been researched extensively, the mechanism underlying the assembly of mature viral particles and the precise method by which rotavirus is able to induce diarrheal disease have not been fully elucidated. The rotavirus replication cycle involves budding of immature progeny virus particles, termed DLPs, from the site of replication and assembly into the lumen of ER via an interaction of the particle with the cytoplasmic domain of a virally encoded non-structural protein, NSP4. Recent studies confirm subcellular localisation of this protein in distinct membrane lipid microdomains at the later stages of the viral replication cycle in polarised epithelial cells and further classify these structures as a final assembly location for mature viral particles. Overall aim of the study presented in Chapter 3 was to characterise the domain of NSP4 responsible for such interaction and to further elucidate the significance of proposed interaction in the context of the rotavirus replication cycle. In order to assess this interaction in vitro, separate domains of the NSP4 protein, expressed by several different recombinant protein expression systems, were applied to a Caco-2 cell lysate and examined by floatation gradient and subsequent Western blot analysis. The NSP4-lipid microdomain interaction was mapped to a part of a coiled-coil domain including amino acids 85 to 122. The potential involvement of NSP4 in translocation progeny DLPs to the site of final viral assembly was also examined. Recent studies suggest involvement of this protein in the pathophysiology of rotavirus-induced diarrhea by acting as an enterotoxin. To mediate enterotoxic effects in vivo, NSP4 needs to be secreted or released from rotavirus-infected cells in a soluble form, but studies indicate that this is a transmembrane glycoprotein located in the ER membrane. Overall aim of the studies outlined in Chapter 4 was to identify and further characterise secretion of NSP4 from rotavirus-infected fully polarised Caco-2 cells. These studies reveal that NSP4 is actively secreted into the culture medium of polarised, but not non-polarised cells. The secretion was detected preferentially from the apical surface and was found to be dramatically inhibited by addition of BFA and monensin, suggesting a Golgi-dependent pathway is involved in release of this protein. In accordance with this finding, the secreted NSP4 isoform was found to undergo additional post-translational modification and is partially resistant to deglycosylation by EndoH and PNGaseF. Furthermore, apical secretion was not blocked by addition of glucosidase- or cholesterol- inhibitors, and no evidence was found that NSP4 was packaged in exosomes for its release. Taken together, these studies outline the pool of NSP4 that is able to actively participate in an assembly of mature progeny virus particles through its interaction with lipid microdomains and further identify a novel, soluble form of NSP4 secreted from rotavirus-infected polarised cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxyprolines and the incorporation of hydroxylated prolines into peptides and glycopeptides</field><field name="creator">Weir, Claudette Ann</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive Biology of Pohutukawa (Metrosideros Excelsa) (Myrtaceae)</field><field name="creator">Schmidt-Adam, Gabriele Hedwig Julia</field><field name="description">The objective of this project is to describe and analyse the reproductive biology of pohutukawa, by integrating information from floral biology, breeding system and pollination biology. New Zealand pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa Sol. ex Gaertn). a member of the Myrtaceae, is a mass-flowering tree endemic to northern New Zealand coastlines. Compound inflorescences develop over a period of ten weeks in six morphologically distinct stages. Trees flower over a peak period of two weeks, and the inflorescences contain an average of 14.3 large, hermaphrodite, red 'brush' flowers that remain open for seven days. Most pollen is viable (93.6%) and the receptivity of the wet-papillate stigma extends for at least nine days. Each flower produces approximately 46 &#956;L nectar per day, containing l8% (w/v) sucrose. Neither dichogamy nor herkogamy prevent pollen and stigma interference, and floral design and display are consistent with high levels of autogamous and geitonogamous self-pollination. The stigmatic exudate of unpollinated pistils stains intensely for carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, but shows a notable decrease in lipids and proteins following pollination. The style has a solid transmitting tissue with large mucilage-filled intercellular spaces which stain weakly for polyanions and pectins irrespective of pollination. Although starch grains in the stylar cortex are depleted following pollination, stylar resources in general appear to be sparse and this results in a low speed of pollen tubes (2 mm / d) through the intercellular spaces of the transmitting tissue. Seed capsules of pohutukawa contain a mixture of fertile (embryo-containing) and infertile (embryo-lacking) seeds. Fertile seeds weigh approximately 0.15 mg. stain positively with 1% tetrazolium chloride, and are randomly disposed on the placenta. Their germination rate exceeds 90% after up to one year of cold storage, but decreases rapidly when stored at room temperature. Controlled pollinations with self- and cross-pollen from single donors and a pollen mixture from five unrelated parents showed that seven out of ten trees were self-incompatible, suggesting that natural populations may consist of a mosaic of self-incompatible and self-compatible individuals. Self-incompatibility is late-acting as pollen tubes from selfs and crosses reach the ovary simultaneously l0 - 15 d after pollination. In common with other Myrtaceae, the seed / ovule ratio in pohutukawa is low and not limited by the stigmatic pollen load. The pollen / ovule ratio of 462.5 (SE &#177;43.4) places the breeding system of pohutukawa between facultative selfing and facultative outcrossing. Mainland populations of pohutukawa have been reduced to fragmented stands, and the original suite of bird pollinators has been largely replaced by introduced species. In contrast, the native pollinator fauna of several offshore islands remains intact, including the three species of the New Zealand honey eaters (Meliphagidae) and solitary bees. Using allozyme analyses. multilocus outcrossing rates were estimated for Little Barrier Island and Tiritiri Matangi Island and for three mainland populations in comparison. They were among the lowest in the Myrtaceae (tm = 0.22 - 0.53) and the loss of native pollinators has no measurable effect on the mating system. Although there is no difference in the germination percentage of fertile seeds from self- and cross-pollination treatments (98.4%), 'selfed' seedlings show marked inbreeding depression in height after six months. Wright's fixation index is consistently higher for seedlings (Fs) than for mothers (Fm) in all populations, indicating that selection may eliminate selfed offspring from populations prior to reproductive maturity. Exclusion experiments were undertaken on Little Barrier Island to assess the effect of native birds and bees on outcrossing and seed production. In bird exclusion experiments in the lower canopy (2 - 4 m) with flower access to bees only, estimated outcrossing rates were lower (tm = 0.40) than in open pollination (tm = 0.58), suggesting that bees effect more self-pollination than birds. The highest outcrossing rates (tm = 0.71) were found for open pollination in the upper canopy (&gt; 4 m). Numbers of fertile seeds per capsule were 45% higher after open pollination than in treatments with bee visitation only, and 28% higher than in treatments where all flower visitors were excluded. The results suggest that native bees visiting pohutukawa flowers reduce seed set and effect less outcrossing than birds, and that a large proportion of seeds arises from automatic self-pollination. In trees of a modified mainland population with predominantly introduced birds and a mixture of introduced and native bees there was no decrease in seed set for the treatment allowing flower access by bees only, indicating that - in contrast to native bees - honeybees did not reduce seed set in pohutukawa. In conclusion, although the floral biology of pohutukawa permits geitonogamy, a combination of outcrossing (predominantly by bird pollinators), self-incompatibility, and inbreeding depression act to maintain heterozygosity and result in the production of sufficient offspring that will ensure the survival of the species.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Assessment and Hazard Modeling of Tropical Forest Fires</field><field name="creator">Ofren, Rey S</field><field name="description">This research study offers a quantitative understanding of the environmental factors related to fire occurrence and its potential distribution. The Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the northwestern region of Thailand, serves as an example to analyze and expand the knowledge base of forest fire ecology in tropical environments. Specific objectives focus on establishing the relationship between physiognomic variables that are related to forest fuel loading among different forest types. In addition, this study aims at modeling and quantifying the relative importance of the biophysical variables associated with the occurrence of tropical forest fires. The methodological framework links Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the potential of statistical analysis. Thematic layers of several biophysical variables are combined in GIS, along with field measurements of fuel loading and stand physiognomy. Under the statistical analysis, the variability and interactions of spatial attributes related to fires are synthesized using the Decision Tree modeling. GIS is further employed to display the modeling results. Rainfall pattern, geological material, aspect and vegetation index variables significantly influence the ability of the Decision Tree model to predict the likely occurrence of fire. They explain most of the processes underlying a hierarchical set of rules that help to distinguish the varying levels of fire hazards. The vegetation index in particular was found to be a strong potential indicator of fire incidents and an underlying driving factor behind fuel moisture dynamics. At a certain vegetation index, two types of forest were distinguished as having wet and dry fuel conditions. The difference in the amount of fuel load between the physiognomically distinct evergreen and deciduous forests is proven to be insignificant, except in the variation of moisture content. Factors contributing to the varying levels of fuel moisture in evergreen forests are controlled by the micro-climate created by its intact crown cover. However, there is no distinct relationship concerning the stand structure of deciduous forest with regard to the dryness of fuel on its floor. The dominance of weather over the fuel variables suggests that forest fire situations in an open and dry stand of deciduous forest is driven by extreme weather conditions. A GlS-generated map of the sanctuary illustrates the spatial variation in fire hazard probabilities as predicted by the Decision Tree model. The prediction accuracy of fire hazard zones based on bio-physical factors is further enhanced by incorporating the proportion of neighbouring areas with high potential for ignition. The potential combustibility and danger rating are determined for the predicted hazard zones. In addition, the spatial association of the neighbouring human settlements is analyzed. This research expands the value of GIS from the usual selective retrieval and investigation of spatial patterns into the evaluation of the complex hierarchical combinations of spatial attributes. The combined effect of GIS and statistical modeling eliminates the problems of handling a mixture of environmental data and identifying both variables and attributes interactions. Likewise, the need to design site-specific fire managemet strategies, as guided by particular combinations of environmental attributes, takes into account the applicability of the data-driven Decision Tree modeling.

This type of analysis consists of determining the power-law parameter of the spectrum of the data, and the scaling of the statistical moments. These techniques were applied to determine how the statistics depended on the duration (or scale) of the fluctuations in wind speed, the atmospheric conditions, and the topography of the site. It was found that the parameterisations produced using multiscaling analysis characterised differences in the statistics for each of these cases. Furthermore, the fractal cascade simulation techniques used provided simple methods for reproducing these statistics. This analysis is followed by an investigation into the robustness of some of these results. In particular, the data is examined for the existence of self-similar distributions of the cascade weighting factor, W. Such self-similar analysis allows the direct simulation of the data via a cascade. Cascade models have the virtue of being able to reproduce statistical properties such as intermittency, and in particular, the nesting of intermittency from different wavenumber bands in the same region of space. The existence of these properties in both the experimental and simulated data is investigated, with consideration given to the consequence of the results for simulation techniques. One notable discovery is the failure of these methods to reproduce the bias in the distribution of the gradients in the wind velocity field. This result has important implications for all workers dealing with simulation of geophysical data by fractal cascades. Finally, a brief numerical experiment is carried out to both demonstrate how this bias may be exploited to construct a model, and to test some of the analysis techniques presented on non-cascade based data. While not a particularly convincing simulator of turbulence, the model nevertheless displays some interesting turbulence-like characteristics.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic structures</field><field name="creator">Rubin, Sasha</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates structures that are presentable by finite automata working synchronously on tuples of finite words.

The work in this thesis describes linkage analysis, mutation screening of candidate genes and the functional analysis of mutant proteins expressed in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic hyperphosphatasia. Idiopathic hyperphosphatasia is an autosomal recessive bone disease characterized by excessive bone resorption and bone formation. Affected children are normal at birth but develop deformities of long bones, kyphosis and acetabular protrusion with increasing severity as they pass through adolescence. There is considerable variability in phenotype, with some cases diagnosed in infancy and others in later childhood. A genome-wide search of a New Zealand family affected by idiopathic hyperphosphatasia suggested linkage to a locus on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24). The gene TNFRSF11B encoding osteoprotegerin (OPG), which lies within 8q24, was an obvious candidate gene given the critical role of OPG in regulating osteoclast development. Mutation screening of this gene indicated an apparent disease-causing mutation in exon 3 in affected individuals of the New Zealand family. Subsequently eight families, recruited by the members of the Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia Collaborative Group in Turkey, Germany, Argentina and the United kingdom were also screened for mutations in the TNFRSF11B gene. Recombinant wild-type and mutant OPG CDNAs were expressed in human epithelial kidney cells, and secreted OPG was collected form the conditioned medium. In vitro measurements of osteoclastic bone resorption showed that wild type OPG suppressed bone resorption, whereas the mutant forms did not, confirming them to be inactivating mutations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations on the cell walls of commelinid monocotyledons</field><field name="creator">Trethewey, Jason Allan Karl</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geophysical exploration of Quaternary ironsand deposits at Taharoa, Waikato North Head and Raglan, west coast, North Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawton, Donald Caleb</field><field name="description">Extensive beach and dune deposits of titanomagnetite sands occur along the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Some of the larger deposits cover an area of greater than 10 km2, with a thickness greater than 50 metres. Deposits at Taharoa, Waikato North Head and Raglan were investigated to determine whether geophysical methods can be used to delineate titanomagnetite concentration patterns within the deposits and also to assess the total reserves of titanomagnetite in each deposit. Laboratory measurements showed that the magnetic susceptibility of the sands increases monotonically with the volume concentration of magnetite CV; the observed variation of magnetic susceptibility as a function of CV can be explained by changes in the resultant magnetic permeability of a binary mixture of magnetic and non-magnetic grains. The density of the sand increases linearly with CV; the particle density of titanomagnetite is 4.7 x 103 kg m-3. The natural remanence of magnetite sands is small (Koenigsberger ratio Q&lt;0.2). No significant induced polarization response could be observed even for mixtures of almost pure magnetite. When placed in an electric field, the magnetite sands were found to be non-conductive. Field measurements showed that total magnetic force anomalies with peak values of up to 1600 nT and 800 nT could be observed over the deposits during aeromagnetic surveys at elevations of 183 m and 366 m respectively. Topographic anomalies were subtracted from the observed data, assuming an average concentration of 18% magnetite for sands in the deposits dawn to an arbitrary datum level. The resulting residual anomalies are caused entirely by sand which is enriched in magnetite (commonly up to 45% to 50% by weight). At Taharoa, the enriched sands were modelled by a 33 x 13 array of vertical prisms (200 m x 200 m dimension), retaining the length and magnetization of each prism as parameter. At Waikato North Head and Raglan, the enriched sands were modelled by three-dimensional polygonal bodies. Ground magnetic studies are suitable for outlining particular magnetite concentration patterns, such as in streams or on beaches. Magnetite concentration patterns Rave gravitational effects of up to &#177;1 mgal, which are distorted by interfering gravitational effects from basement structures at Taharoa and by a strong regional gradient at Waikato Heads. However, the gravity data at Taharoa could be interpreted in terms of basement depths, whereas at Waikato North Head, gravity anomalies outline magnetite-enriched sub-deposits which occur below sea level. Concentration patterns above sea level at Waikato North Head could not be accurately defined from the gravity data. Seismic refraction studies showed that the Taharoa deposit is up t o 200 m thick. The seismic velocity in the drifting surface sands increases linearly with depth, from a surface velocity of 0.24 km sec-1 to a maximum of 0.65 km sec-1, with a rate of increase varying from 19 to 30 sec-1. These sands are underlain by a weakly cemented, homogeneous sand unit which has a velocity of 1.7 &#177; 0.1 km sec-1 and has a titanomagnetite concentration of less than 18% by weight. The two sand members are separated by a sequence of tephras and paleosols. Values of DC-resistivity observed over the deposits exceed 104 ohm-m in dry sand and are as low as 102 ohm-m in saturated clay- bound sands. Small frequency effects of up to 14% were observed in clean sands at Taharoa. Magnetite sand deposits can be successfully prospected by geophysical methods. Airborne magnetic surveys are most applicable; a flightline spacing of 0.5 km allows magnetite concentration patterns with wavelengths greater than 200 m to be resolved. The seismic refraction method delineates the vertical extent of the deposits. Gravity, ground magnetic and electrical methods can be used to test specific objectives. Electromagnetic methods were found to be unsuitable for the prospecting of ironsand deposits. Ore reserves of magnetite calculated from the interpretation of the geophysical data were found to be significantly greater than previous estimates. At Taharoa, a total mass of 545 x 106 tonnes of enriched sand with an average magnetite concentration of 38% was calculated from geophysical data. Three major and three minor sub-deposits of enriched sands, containing a total of 580 x 106 tonnes with an average concentration of 46% magnetite are indicated from similar data at Waikato North Head; of these, two major sub-deposits, which occur below Sea level and which contain 230 x 106 tonnes of sand (114 x 106 tonnes of magnetite) were not previously known. The ore reserves at Raglan amount to 56 x 106 tonnes with an average concentration of 36% titanomagnetite. As well as the enriched sands, all three deposits also contain large reserves of low-grade magnetite sand. It is postulated that a large proportion of the magnetite sands which have accumulated along the west coast of the North Island may have been derived from the erosion of extensive Quaternary tephra sheets which originated from numerous centres in the Central Volcanic Zone.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis using 4,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-dioxanes</field><field name="creator">Lorimer, Rachel Manu</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's Relations With Northeast Asia: Links and Interactions Under Globalisation</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Christina A</field><field name="description">In the mid-1980s New Zealand embarked on a path of radical economic reform. The changes that occurred and are still occurring in New Zealand are in part, of external origin and came about from an opening of the domestic economy to wider forces thereby re-incorporating New Zealand into the global economy. Le Heron and Pawson (1996) propose that in the 1990s, economic globalization &#8211; the process of integration, deepening and differentiation of economic activities throughout the world -- has lead to new links and interactions. In seeking to identify the external and internal forces leading to the development of new links and interactions between New Zealand and Northeast Asia (Japan, Taiwan and Korea), analysis is made of changes occurring within investment, production and trade connections. This thesis is informed by two bodies of literature: the world systems literature stresses the development of inter-country relationships in an historical context, and political economy literature links resource regimes to periods of capitalist accumulation. In order to remain active participants in the global economy New Zealand entreprises and industries are pursuing strategies of linking into the Northeast Asian economies. Two key economic sectors, agro-food and forestry, have been chosen for investigation in order to examine changes as New Zealand industries, enterprises and local regions seek to achieve greater integration into the Northeast Asian region. A re-articulation of production is occurring as New Zealand's agro-food sector is incorporated into a Northeast Asian food import complex. Changing patterns of production and consumption are examined within the context of the food regime perspective. While new opportunities are increasing for New Zealand agro-food exporters, trade still reflects New Zealand's traditional export base of first and second food regime products from the beef and dairy sectors. The expansion of a fresh fruit and vegetable complex represents an emerging third regime. Since the mid-1980s the New Zealand forestry sector has become increasingly integrated into a national complex centered upon Japan. The dismantling of the national regulatory regime introduced a number of foreign investors and subsequently led to the reorganisation of trade and production networks. Prior to this time, forestry exports to Northeast Asia were inconsistent, comprising mostly logs and low value products with processing occurring in Japan. While unprocessed exports remain a significant composition of forestry trade there is a move away from low value products into more end-use-application specific production. This is accompanied by a shift in production facilities and an increase of economic surplus in New Zealand. Land based industries in the Hawkes Bay provide examples of local adaptations of production to agro-food and forestry complexes centred upon Northeast Asia. Integration into these complexes has facilitated access to new markets and resulted in increasing degrees of added value. This has only been possible in the context of the gradual relaxation of regulatory regimes that has occurred over the past two decades. In some cases, integration is an outcome of Northeast Asian ownership of New Zealand based nodes along the commodity chain. In others, it is an outcome of New Zealand actors producing to meet 'site of consumption' demand. In spite of New Zealand's adjustments to globalisation, it essentially remains a semi-peripheral production site.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of models for sustainable fisheries</field><field name="creator">Batstone, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian analysis of financial time series</field><field name="creator">Berg, Andreas, 1972-</field><field name="description">In the last decades new ideas in the analysis of time series which are based on the assumption that trading is performed continuously in time have been developed. This idea has its strength in its flexibility and can overcome many theoretical and practical dlfficulties experienced with discrete time analysis. Due to Itos Lemma continuous time models are mathematically tractable, however in practice, statistical analysis is generally difficult since observations are available only at discrete times. Modelling continuous time models using stochastic differential equations including Brownian motions is a natural approach owing to the diffusion type motions of the models involved. I will introduce the most widely used processes for analysing financial models based on continuous time series and review common discretization methods, as well as approximation and estimation techniques. I will then concentrate on stochastic volatility models, which can also be derived from continuous time models and are nowadays commonly applied to analyse stock market data to exchange rates. Additionally, stochastic volatility models offer an alternative to the Black-Scholes models as a basis for pricing options. Latest advances in estimation methods for this demanding model will be reviewed. I will focus on several ideas on performing a Bayesian analysis for parameter estimation, once of them is based on automatic differentiation and the extended Kalman filter. This technique is compared with other Bayesian estimation procedures in terms of efficiency with simulated and real data sets. The need for reliable model checking criteria within the class of stochastic volatility models is revealed to be a complicated issue. Many of the classical or Bayesian standard approaches can not be adapted to this task. Therefore, a new idea on how to perform Bayesian model checking is taken up and further developed for the needs of comparing stochastic volatility models. The resulting deviance information criterion is compared with the more popular but far more computationally demanding Bayes factors and the easy to derive, but less accurate harmonic means. Furthermore I will give an overview of interest spot-rate models, which have their origin in continuous time. After introducing the latest literature on interest rate specific models, a new estimation technique based on latent observations for discretely observed diffusions using Bayesian methods is reviewed and a prior sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess estimation bias in the Vasicek model. Several case studies and simulations are carried out and results are reported at the end of each chapter.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorescence lifetime measurements using a synchronously pumped dye laser</field><field name="creator">Davis, Lloyd Mervyn</field><field name="description">Experimental techniques for measuring fluorescence lifetimes were evaluated for the purpose of studying the fluorescence quenching of the biologically important dye ethidium. A synchronously pumped cavity dumped dye laser was used to produce stable high repetition rate picosecond pulses for sample excitation. A system was established for recording nanosecond decay profiles by time correlated single photon counting. A careful investigation of the factors which contribute to the instrumental time jitter enabled an overall impulse response of 600 ps to be achieved. Software was developed for analysing fluorescence decay profiles by the method of convolution and curve fitting and its capability for accurately resolving multiple exponential components was evaluated using simulated data. Some improvement in accuracy was obtained by modifying the Poisson weights used in the curve fitting routine to allow for non-statistical errors, caused primarily by the wavelength dependence of the time response of the single photon counting photomultiplier. Fluorescence polarization effects are discussed. The rotational lifetime of Rhodamine 6G in ethylene glycol was determined by measuring the fluorescence polarization anisotropy decay and the Debye-Stokes-Einstein theory reaffirmed for small molecules at moderate viscosities. The torsional rigidity of DNA can be determined by measuring the depolarization of fluorescence of tightly bound (intercalated) ethidium, and this was not observed to change appreciably when the antitumour drug amsacrine also binds to the DNA. The fluorescence quenching of DNA intercalated ethidium by anticancer drugs was studied by accurately resolving the fluorescence decay profiles into exponential components. The lifetimes and proportions are interpreted in terms of current theories for drug binding and fluorescence quenching mechanisms. The fluorescence quenching behaviour by the antitumour drug amsacrine is consistent with a previously proposed electron transfer mechanism.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fossil barnacles (Cirripedia: Thoracica) of New Zealand and Australia</field><field name="creator">Buckeridge, John Stewart</field><field name="description">The fossil Cirripedia : Thoracica of Australia and New Zealand have been studied. One hundred and three taxa are now known as fossil, and these are systematically described and illustrated. A number of major systematic revisions are proposed, including 1 new superfamily, 6 new subfamilies, 7 new genera, 2 new subgenera and 52 new species or subspecies. The material studied has revealed inconsistencies in the presently held views on phylogeny. Amongst the Balanomorpha, the Balanidae are shown to have evolved from a new six-plated archaeobalanid (with a tripartite rostrum), rather than Hexelasma; and in the Lepadomorpha, Arcoscalpellum is revised, and a new genus, which gave rise to many modern arcoscalpellids, is proposed. The difficulties in assigning the more primitive representatives of families to generic level are discussed, and keys are introduced to facilitate identification. The study also identifies many taxa with restricted time ranges, illustrating the stratigraphic importance of cirripeds. Thoracican ecology is discussed, and it is shown that early taxa preferred the shallower upper shelf environment; but following an explosive evolutionary radiation during the Lower Cenozoic, a great diversity of habitats became occupied. Neogene species especially, can be of considerable importance in paleoecology, both as indicators of depth and temperature. Faunal relationships are discussed in the light of new advances in plate tectonics. An early association between Australia and New Zealand can be recognised, and this is followed in the Neogene by the development of a South American fauna with distinct Australasian influences. Laboratory techniques, including thin section analysis and scanning electron microscopy are discussed with relevance to their use in identification.

The rate of absorption of low concentrations of SO2 (~ 500 &#181;g.m-3) was examined, varying a number of parameters. The results were expressed as deposition velocities (Vg = flux/gas concentration). Vg did not vary with relative humidity. Deposition into acid solutions (pH &lt;3) was controlled by diffusion processes in the liquid film while under more alkaline conditions (pH &gt;4) the process was governed by the rate at which SO2 could diffuse to the interface through the gas boundary layer. Oxidizing agents (e.g. H2O2) were found to increase the rate of diffusion in the liquid boundary layer. Salts generally exerted a more complex effect on liquid phase diffusion. Vg for SO2 deposition into aqueous solution under calm conditions and at pH values expected in the atmosphere was calculated to be about 0.7 cm.s-1 from these experiments. Efflux of SO2 from solution was examined at low pH values under boundary conditions similar to the deposition work. At high S(IV) concentrations in solution (~10-3N) the half lives for SO2 desorption from solution were 600, 1020, 3300 s for pH values 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 respectively. The consequences of the experimental results are discussed with respect to the atmosphere at large and to scrubbing of flue gases. Poor absorption rates for SO2 at low pH values suggested that sea water with its high pH would be an excellent scrubbings agent and its buffering ability was investigated. Experiments showed 10-3M S(IV) could be absorbed with the pH dropping only as far as pH 5.5. (2) The Oxidation of Sulphur Dioxide in Aqueous Solution The rate of oxidation in 10-5M of SO2 solutions was examined. The results showed the reaction to be very sensitive to traces of metallic ions, which made it impossible to determine the uncatalysed rate. The half life for oxidation of S(IV) in (10-5M) in triply distilled water was 36, 8, 5 hours at pH 4.6, 5.2, and 6 respectively. The rate increased upon addition of traces (10-6M) of Fe(III) and Mn(II) ions (pH 4 &#8211; 5) while Cu(II) seemed to act as an inhibitor. In solutions of ammonium sulphate Fe(III) was found to be an excellent catalyst. The reaction appeared to have a variable order with respect to S(IV) being 1st order at pH &lt;4 and 2nd order at pH &gt;5. Results in potassium sulphate were similar, but the reactions somewhat slower. At pH &gt;5 the reaction was sensitive to the alkali used for neutralization, the oxidation rate being much greater if ammonium hydroxide was used rather than sodium hydroxide. Solutions of ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate showed a second order dependence on S(IV) concentration at high pH values. The Fe(III) catalysed oxidation was faster in 'Chloride' solutions than in 'sulphate' solutions at pH &lt;4. A radical mechanism previously proposed by a number of workers was found to give considerable insight into the complex experimental results. (3) The Dissolution of Iron from Ferric Oxide and Pulverized Fuel Ash The aqueous oxidation of SO2 requires the presence of a catalytic metal ion. The most abundant catalyst in the atmosphere would appear to be iron. However, it would have to be present in solution to be an effective homogeneous catalyst. The rates of dissolution of iron from Fe2O3 were investigated and found to be extremely slow even in the presence of H2SO4 or 'H2SO3'. The dissolution of iron from pulverised fuel ash (a possible atmospheric source of iron in polluted areas) is quite rapid even under only Moderately acid conditions (pH 3.5) where solutions 1.9 x 10-4 M in Fe(III) can be reached in a matter of 20 minutes. The high rate of dissolution is thought to arise from the fusing of iron oxides with other alkaline oxides in the furnace.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmium complexes as models for CO reduction intermediates</field><field name="creator">Headford, Christine E. L.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the synthesis, and aspects of the chemistry, of carbon-donor complexes of osmium as organo-metallic models for CO reduction intermediates. In Chapter 1 some aspects of ligand reactivity of the carbon-donor ligands CO, CS, CSe, CTe and carbenes in transition metal complexes are reviewed. The reduction reactions of these ligands are emphasized. The preparation and structure of the osmium &#951;2-formaldehyde complex Os(&#951;2-CH2O)(CO)2(PPh3)2 is described in Chapter 2. This complex has proved to be a useful synthetic precursor for stable osmium formyl, hydroxymethyl, methoxymethyl and halomethyl (-CH2X, X = Cl, Br, I) complexes and some facets of the reactivity of these ligands have been investigated. A general synthetic route to neutral osmium formyl complexes Os(CHO)X(CO)2(PPh3)2(X = halide or alkyl) has been developed. The facile preparation of a stable example of an intermediate formed during decarbonylation of a simple aldehyde by a transition metal, the osmium monohapto-acetyl-hydrido complex Os(&#951;1-C[O]CH3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2, has been demonstrated. A preliminary study of the reactions of the osmium iodomethyl complex Os(CH2I)I(CO)2(PPh3)2 is reported in Chapter 3. The typical reaction of this species is nucleophilic substitution; in many respects reactivity is analogous to an electrophilic methylidene complex. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles [e.g. OR-, H-, EH- (E = S, Se, Te), NH2R and PR3] has been investigated and the ligand reactivity of some of these derivatives studied. A synthetic route to &#951;2-CSeS and &#951;2-CSe2 complexes of osmium without the use of molecular CSeS or CSe2 has been developed and the isolation of the geometrical isomers of the &#951;2-CSeS complex Os(&#951;2-CSeS)(CO)(CNR)(PPh3)2 (arising from &#951;2-C,S or &#951;2-C,Se coordination) has been achieved. The synthesis of a stable osmium hydrido-selenocarbonyl complex, OsHCl(CO)(CSe) (PPh3)2, has allowed the direct observation of hydride transfer from metal to CSe ligand. These latter results are discussed in Chapter 4.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Conductive film model for the kinetics of the lead anode in aqueous sulphuric acid</field><field name="creator">Hall, Simon Berners</field><field name="description">The kinetics and mechanism of the anodic process on lead in aqueous 35% H2SO4 (4.65 mol L-1) were studied. The lead anode is of interest as it is used in the form of the sponge lead negative plate in the lead-acid battery. Discharge of both planar and porous lead electrodes result in the electrocrystallisation of PbSO4. In the past, the processes occurring at the lead electrode have been shown to include: dissolution, precipitation, and passivation. The techniques used were cyclic voltammetry, potential-step, and potential-ramp/potential-hold. The resultant transients were recorded both as analogue and digital waveforms. Investigations were carried out at a constant acid strength over a range of temperatures (-18&#176; to 30&#176;C), and in the presence of additives. Significant variation was found in cyclic voltammetry with regard to the cathodic potential prehistory immediately prior to measurements. After extreme cathodic polarisation (below -1500 mV us SHE), voltammograms were recorded with relatively high anodic peak currents and charges. The extra charge was associated with the growth of a multilayer, and dissolution from the bare electrode. This multilayer is not reduced on subsequent moderate cathodic excursions (above -1000 mV). Hence for cyclic voltammograms in the absence of extreme cathodic polarisation one observes relatively small currents and anodic charges. This is due to transmission of Pb2+ ions through the multilayer under resistance control. Passivation occurs in both cases by precipitation of microcrystalline PbSO4 on the multilayer. In contrast to cyclic voltammetry, potential-step transients were insensitive to cathodic polarisation and displayed current peaks due to growth of the surface film. One also observes a dissolution current from the bare electrode before it is covered by the growing film. The current first increases, passes through a maximum, and then decays with time. The increasing current was associated with growth of the multilayer, and the decaying current due to passivation by PbSO4. A new model was successfully applied to the potential-step and potential sweep results. The model consists of several charge-transfer reactions: growth of a multilayer, dissolution from the bare electrode, and transmission of Pb2+ through the multilayer. The kinetics of the multilayer are pivotal to the other charge-transfer reactions. The inclusion of film transmission is the novel aspect of this model. Quantitative analysis of the model resulted in a set of optimised parameters that follow plausible variation with anodic potential. Both the potential step and potential sweep transients are adequately described by the model. The effect of chloride added to the electrolyte was studied. The anodic and cathodic peaks in cyclic voltammetry are enhanced by this anion (100% more anodic charge at higher chloride concentrations) and the cathodic to anodic charge ratio is markedly increased. The general form of the potential-step transients are not modified by chloride. Evidence of a monolayer of PbCl2 was found (q = 500 &#181;C cm-2) in both cyclic voltammetry and potential step experiments. The monolayer of PbCl2 must underlie the subsequent growth of the multilayer as the monolayer is first formed in potential-step experiments and first to be reduced in cyclic voltammetry at a small underpotential. The effect of methyl orange on the lead anode was explored and found to enhance the charge capacity. Battery tests confirmed these observations, but methyl orange was destroyed by the oxidising PbO2 at the positive plate. Hence a derivative, designed to be insoluble in H2SO4, was synthesised. However, experiments on both planer and porous electrodes showed that the derivative, lauryl orange, C12H25NHC6H4NNH+C6H4SO3- (pKa = 4.06) was found to act as an inhibitor for the anodic reactions. In particular there was no contribution from multilayer growth in potential step experiments, and only dissolution (markedly diminished) and passivation were evident. Lauryl orange exhibited the required capabilities to bind to lead metal. The structure of lauryl orange was confirmed by n.m.r. and mass spectrometry.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interspecific hybridization in Fuchsia</field><field name="creator">Talluri, Rama Srinivas</field><field name="description">Fuchsia is a large and distinctive genus in the family Onagraceae comprising over 110 species, classified into 12 sections. The tropical Andes, Mexico-Central America, Hispaniola, southeastern Brazil, southern Andes and South Pacific region (New Zealand and Tahiti) are the biodiversity hotspots for this genus. It is also an important floricultural genus of trees and shrubs. Fuchsia procumbens, a New Zealand endemic species is unique with upright yellow flowers, unusual blue pollen and procumbent plant growth characters, characters that are absent from existing cultivars. One goal of this research was to investigate whether these characters could be transferred between species by artificial hybridization. An extensive hybridization programme both between the American species and between them and the New Zealand one resulted in the production of many new hybrids. The morphological features and parentage of these new hybrids were documented in this study. A significant first has been the production of a yellow flowered hybrid from a cross between F. encliandra and F. procumbens. It combines the plant growth character of F. encliandra and the flower colour and form of F. procumbens. The procumbent plant growth character has also been transferred in a cross with F. splendens but this hybrid has yet to flower. Many other interesting hybrids have also been produced with interesting variation in both floral and vegetative characters. Not all cross combinations were successful and a variety of pre- and post-fertilization barriers to hybridization were observed, some of which were investigated in more detail. Once hybrids were produced in the crosses between American species most of the plants were vigorous, unlike most of hybrids produced between New Zealand and American species. An exception amongst the crosses between American species produced sub-viable plants that showed a virus-like syndrome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of novel anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Rustenhoven, Job Jesse</field><field name="description">The synthesis of novel C9-halogenated anthracyclinones by Lewis acid promoted cyclisations of ortho-methallyl anthraquinonyl chiral dioxanes has been investigated. Tin tetrachloride-N,N-dimethylformamide promoted cyclisation of the dioxane (30) proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity to give an 82% yield of the diastereomerically pure chlorotetracycle (78). Stronger Lewis acids gave poorer selectivity and boron trifluoride etherate reacted slowly with (30) but with high selectivity to give the diastereomerically pure fluorotetracycle (91) in 58% yield. The presence of a &#946;-methoxy group in the substrate leads to decreased stereoselectivity due to competition between chelation and non-chelation controlled pathways. Stereochemistry was assigned to the products using a combination of X-ray crystallography, conformational analysis, nuclear Overhauser enhancements and chemical degradation. Attempts were made to extend the highly selective acetal cyclisation methodology to the intramolecular reaction of the allylsilane (121), cyclisation of which was expected to provide enantioselective access to the alkene (146). The synthesis of (121) was achieved despite its instability, but attempted cyclisations with Lewis acids or fluoride ions were unsuccessful. The racemic alkene (146) was prepared by an ene cyclisation and subjected to asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD). The products from the AD reactions are of considerable biological interest and have been characterized. Their stereochemistry has been assigned by 1H nmr comparisons with the parent diphenols, which have resulted in revisions of assignments made by earlier workers.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of two amylin responsive proteins from rat skeletal muscle</field><field name="creator">Lee, Shao Chin</field><field name="description">Two amylin responsive proteins, here designated ARP1 and ARP2, were discovered from rat skeletal muscle through two dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. ARP1 was detected only in amylin-stimulated muscles where the insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen was inhibited. This protein incorporated 32Pi but not [35S]-methionine in the metabolic labeling experiments. Subsequent molecular characterisation revealed that ARP1 was a novel monomeric form (designated form 1) of protein p20, and two other monomeric forms (designated forms 2 and 3 respectively) of protein p20 were also characterised. The production of ARP1 was not affected by the presence of insulin, but calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was found to evoke the production of ARP1 in the presence or absence of insulin. In contrast, ARP2 was detected in both control and amylin-stimulated muscles. Amylin stimulation evoked incorporation of [35S]-methionine but not 32Pi into the protein and increased its concentration significantly. It is concluded that amylin elicits the production of ARP1 through phosphorylation and increases the protein biosynthesis of ARP2; the amylin-evoked production of ARP1 is insulin independent; amylin and CGRP share, at least in part, an intracellular signal transduction pathway; and ARP1 and 2 may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. It is suggested that ARP1 and 2 could potentially be used as molecular markers for the analysis of amylin action.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiative transfer in multiply layered media</field><field name="creator">De Lautour, N. J. (Nathaniel J.)</field><field name="description">The theory of radiative transfer is applied to the problem of multiple wave scattering in a one-dimensional multilayer. A new mathematical model of a multilayer is presented in which both the refractive index and width of each layer are randomized. The layer widths are generated by a new probability distribution which allows for strong layer width disorder. An expression for the transport mean free path of the multilayer is derived based on its single-scattering properties. It will be shown that interference between the field reflected from adjacent layer interfaces remains significant even in the presence of strong layer width disorder. It will be proven that even when the scattering is weak, the field in a random multilayer localizes at certain frequencies. The effect of increasing layer width randomization on this form of localization is quantified.  The radiative transfer model of time-harmonic scattering in multilayers is extended to narrow-band pulse propagation in weakly scattering media. The tendency of pulses to broaden in this medium is discussed. A radiative transport model of the system is developed and compared to numerical solutions of the wave equation. It is observed that pulse broadening is not described by simple transfer theory. The radiative transfer model is extended by the addition of a Laplacian term in an attempt to model the effect of ensemble average pulse broadening. Numerical simulation results in support of this proposal are given, and applications for the theory suggested.  Finally, the problem of acoustic wave scattering by planar screens is considered. The study was motivated by the idea that multiple scattering experiments may prove possible in a medium composed of such scatterers. Successful multiple scattering in a medium of planar scatterers will depend on the scattering cross-section at angles away from normal incidence. The scattering cross-section is calculated for a circular disc using a new technique for solving the acoustic wave equation on planar surfaces. The method is validated by comparison with available analytic solutions and the geometric theory of diffraction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radiative transfer</field><field name="subject">one-dimensional multilayer</field><field name="subject">localization</field><field name="subject">plane screen diffraction</field><field name="subject">wavelets</field><field name="subject">transport mean free path</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240200 Theoretical and Condensed Matter Physics::240201 Theoretical physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics::240501 Acoustics and acoustical devices; waves</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular approaches to horticultural crop improvement</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Ross G</field><field name="description">Plant biotechnology and molecular biology are now being used to complement conventional breeding programmes in most of the world's important crop species. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to improve New Zealand's horticultural crop plants through application of similar molecular techniques. A) Gene transfer systems for apple, pepino and tamarillo Tissue culture systems were developed for micropropagation and regeneration of apple (cv Royal Gala), pepino (cv El Camino) and tamarillo (selection Oratia Red). In all three species, transient expression of the gusA reporter gene was observed and kanamycin resistant callus was produced, following inoculation with the pKIWI110 binary vector in the avirulent Agrobacterium strain LBA4404. No transgenic apple shoots were obtained. However, transgenic pepino and tamarillo plants expressing the gusA reporter gene, kanamycin resistance and herbicide tolerance were successfully regenerated. PCR and Southern analysis provided molecular evidence for integration of foreign DNA into the genomes of transgenic pepino and tamarillo plants, but indicated deletions of the integrated T-DNAs had occurred with high frequency. Inheritance of the transgenic phenotypes was demonstrated in the progeny of transgenic tamarillo plants. B) Characterisation of polygalacturonase genes A kiwifruit genomic clone with homology to a tomato cDNA clone for polygalacturonase (PG) was sequenced over an 8.1 kb region. The sequence revealed a gene divided into nine exons, with 58% overall identity to the tomato PG gene at the amino acid level. Significant homology was also noted to PG genes isolated from peach, Oenothera organensis and maize, particularly in several blocks of conserved amino acids believed to encode the active site of the enzyme. Analysis of the kiwifruit PG promoter revealed three 81 bp direct repeat sequences just upstream of the kiwifruit peptide start codon. These repeats were also conserved in a second kiwifruit PC genomic clone. Characterisation of partial cDNA clones indicated that at least two mRNAs for PG were expressed in ripe kiwifruit. Southern hybridisation detected the PG gene at low copy number in the genomes of kiwifruit, two other Actinidia species, apple and pepino. PCR was used to amplify a fragment of the apple PG gene for sequence analysis. PG sequences were also used to help define the genetic origin of kiwifruit. A region of the PG gene was amplified and sequenced from four Actinidia species: kiwifruit (A. deliciosa), A. chinensis, A. eriantha and A. chrysantha. These sequences were used to produce a phylogeny using PAUP (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony). Two distinct lineages of PG genes were observed in the genomes of A. deliciosa, A. chinensis and A. eriantha. Within both these lineages, A. deliciosa sequences were quite distinct to those found in the other three Actinidia species, with the exception of a single sequence that was identical to A. chinensis. These results suggest that hexaploid kiwifruit is an allopolyploid with A. chinensis and at least one other Actinidia species as likely progenitors.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Atomic Trampoline Cavity</field><field name="creator">Liston, Gregory John</field><field name="description">Using an intense evanescent light wave as the lower mirror, and the gravitational force as the upper mirror, a vertical cavity for storing atoms can be constructed. Transverse confinement is obtained by totally internally reflecting the light off a concave as opposed to a planar crystal surface, which results in any atom reflected by the evanescent potential at a position away from the central axis receiving an impulse towards it. After a cursory discussion of atom optics and atomic cavities, we outline the configuration of the atomic trampoline cavity described above, and present analysis of the motion of atoms within it. A discussion of the classical dynamics and quantum modes in the cavity is given, together with other complicating factors which act as loss mechanisms out of the cavity. Various aspects of obtaining experimental realizations and applications of the cavity are considered. A detailed study of the quantum dynamics of atoms in the three dimensional cavity reveals that the dispersion can be adequately described in the transverse directions using a simulation involving a classical distribution of point-like atoms, where the probability density of finding an atom at a particular position in the simulation corresponds to the probability density of the atomic wavefunction. The classical simulations, however, significantly underestimate the spreading in the vertical direction. By calculating the modes of the atomic trampoline cavity, both in and out of the evanescent potential, the proportion of each of the modes in the excited state, and hence the decay rate, or linewidth due to spontaneous emission can be calculated. We found that even when the effect of the evanescent potential was included, the modes obtained correspond to those calculated by Wallis, Dalibard and Cohen-Tiennoudji [Appl. Phys. B 54,407 (1992)], who treated the bottom potential as infinitely steep and not exponentially decaying. In contrast to an optical Fabry-P&#233;rot cavity, the linewidth was found to be strongly dependent on energy. Various other cavity parameters (finesse and Q) which depend on the loss due to spontaneous emission were also calculated. Using a ring cavity rather than a laser traveling wave to provide the light that totally internally reflects off the internal surface of the dielectric crystal, we can accumulate the phase change due to the single atom bouncing into and out of the evanescent wave and altering the refractive index of the cavity. A measurement of the phase of this light will reveal information about the atom. We found that the measurement did not significantly alter the mean or standard deviation of the atomic energy distribution across the modes of the cavity, as to first order the phase change of the light in the cavity is independent of the energy of the atom. The significant change in the energy distribution was the introduction of oscillations, which occurred when the phase measured was significantly different from the expected mean. The reason for these oscillations is that the measurement implies the weighting of modes just entering or leaving the evanescent wave should be increased or decreased. Ways of bringing this currently infeasible experiment closer to being achievable using novel design mechanisms are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photoelectrochemistry and Spectroscopy of Conducting Polymer Electrodes</field><field name="creator">Kilmartin, Paul A</field><field name="description">Photoelectrochemistry and Spectroscopy of Conducting Polymer Electrodes Paul A. Kilmartin The conductive properties of films of polyaniline, substituted polyanilines, polypyrrole and polythiophene formed on platinum electrodes have been studied using photoelectrochemical, spectroscopic and surface science techniques. Bands due to oxidised and reduced forms of the polymers were monitored using in situ Raman spectroscopy, with polyaniline giving separate bands and polypyrrole showing an apparent shift of the main &#957;CC mode by 35 cm-1 V-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allowed the elements of the polymers to be quantified into their various oxidation states, particularly through a deconvolution of the N 1s peak. Microscopic mounds of polymer were seen under atomic force microscopy consistent with the extent of polymer growth. The current response to a light flash perturbation on a milli-second time scale provided new information about the conducting polymers. For polyaniline in an insulating state, short-lived photocurrents were observed (less than 1.5 ms), while for polyaniline in a conductive state, longer-lasting photocurrents were observed (greater than 1.5 ms). Prolonged photocurrents indicative of high conductivity were observed up to a pH of 3.7, beyond which only shorter transients were obtained, consistent with previous polyaniline conductivity studies. The transition from conducting to insulating regions at more positive potentials was marked by the appearance of a short-lived cathodic photoresponse, which occurred at more positive potentials as the pH was lowered. Two models are proposed to account for the photocurrents. In the insulating state, the polyaniline film functions as a capacitance, with the fast transients being caused by discharge of surface states. In the conductive state, the prolonged anodic and cathodic photocurrents arise from redox processes with expulsion of solution species. Consistent with these models, polypyrrole showed only cathodic photocurrents (with anion release) and sulfonated polyaniline only anodic photocurrents (release of protons). The stable yellow film of parathiocyanogen (SCN)x formed by oxidation of SCN- at a platinum electrode in warm methanolic solution was studied, and was shown to be insulating and electroinactive, with short-lived photocurrents unless exposed to potentials greater than 1 V. Oxidation of SeCN- in aqueous solutions produced an analogous, though less stable, orange paraselenocyanogen film.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Natural Products Containing Hydroxylated Pyrrolidines</field><field name="creator">Park, Jae Hyun</field><field name="description">This thesis contains two parts.

Rather than write one summary, an abstract for each chapter has been given in the order they are presented in the thesis. Chapter I. The prey species of domestic cats (Felis catus) in two suburbs of Auckland city, New Zealand. The prey brought in by 80 cats (Felis catus), over a year was monitored in two suburbs of Auckland New Zealand. The survey technique followed that of Churcher &amp; Lawton (1987) where cat owners were asked to record (and if possible keep) the prey their cats brought in. The results for the year indicated that there were distinct differences in the type of prey taken by cats in each area. Rodents were the most important prey brought in by domestic cats in an urban / forest fringe habitat and invertebrates were the main prey brought in by domestic cats in a fully urban habitat. Birds and lizards were the second and third most important prey groups in both study areas. Rat and mouse snap trap indexes which were run at each study location, did not detect rodents in the urban habitat. The results from the urban/forest fringe concurred more with studies of feral cat diet in New Zealand whilst those from the urban area compared more to studies of domestic and stray cat diet in urban areas overseas. There were seasonal trends in the prey captured in each area and in both areas cats hunted less over the winter months. Chapter II. Diets of coexisting alien mammalian carnivores in Northern New Zealand. 120 feral cats, 85 stoats (Mustela erminea), 28 weasels (M. nivalis) and 16 ferrets (M. furo) were caught over three years, in Northland, New Zealand. The gut contents of these animals were examined and their food habits described. The main prey groups of cats were (in order of importance by weight), lagomorphs, rodents (Rattus spp &amp; Mus musculus), other mammals, birds and invertebrates. The main prey of stoats were rodents, birds, lagomorphs, skinks (Cyclodina spp) and invertebrates. Skinks, followed by mice, were the main prey of weasels. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were the most commonly occurring prey item in the ferret guts. The food habits for cats and stoats were compared between different habitats within the Northland region where these animals were collected from. There was little difference between habitats, but invertebrates occurred more frequently and lagomorphs less frequently in the diet of animals from forest habitats compared to those from forest / pasture and coastal habitats. No differences were found in the prey of male and female cats, but invertebrates occurred more frequently in the guts of sub-adult cats compared to adult cats. Skinks occurred more frequently in the guts of female stoats, which tended to take smaller prey items than males. Chapter III. Home range of introduced mammalian carnivores, feral cats (Felis catus), stoats (Mustela erminea) and a ferret (M. furo) at Trounson Kauri Park, Northland, New Zealand. The minimum home ranges of eleven feral cats, four stoats and one male ferret were examined by radio telemetry at Trounson Kauri Park in Northland New Zealand. The average minimum home range of male feral cats was 305 &#177; 74ha. This was not significantly larger than the 122 &#177; 35 ha minimum average home range of female cats. The minimum average home range of three male stoats was 108 &#177; 19 ha and the minimum home range of one female stoat was 50 ha. The male ferret had a minimum home range of 179 ha. There was no overlap spatially, in the home range of three adult male cats. There was also very little spatial overlap in the home range of four female cats. There was substantial home range overlap with four sub-adult male cats. The home ranges of these sub-adult male cats also overlapped spatially with those of the adjacent females and adult males. The home ranges of two male stoats overlapped spatially to some degree and the home range of another male stoat overlapped that of the female stoat substantially. The home range of the male ferret overlapped the home ranges of all of the cats occupying similar areas of the park. The home ranges of two male stoats overlapped the home ranges of the adjacent cats but not into the "core" areas of those cats ranges. Chapter IV. Secondary poisoning of introduced mammalian carnivores during possum and rodent control operations at Trounson Kauri Park, Northland New Zealand. Predatory mammals were monitored by radio telemetry through a 1080 then brodifacoum poison baiting operation at Trounson Kauri Park in Northland, New Zealand to target possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and rodents (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus &amp; Mus musculus). All six feral cats (Felis catus), and the single stoat (Mustela erminea) and ferret (Mustela furo) being monitored at the beginning of the operation died of secondary poisoning following the 1080 operation. A further two cats and four stoats were radio tagged and monitored through the ongoing poisoning campaign using brodifacoum in a continuous baiting regime. None of these radio tagged carnivores died of secondary poisoning. However, tissue analysis of additional carnivores trapped at Trounson found that cats, weasels (Mustela nivalis) and to a lesser extent stoats did contain brodifacoum residues. The duration that the radio tagged predators were alive in and around Trounson Kauri Park suggested that the secondary poisoning effect was much reduced under the continuous baiting strategy, compared to the initial 1080 poison operation. Chapter V. Managing alien mammals in mainland New Zealand: The implications for predator/prey interactions in complex communities. Recent advancements in alien pest mammal control technologies have enabled conservation managers to attempt long term, large scale, predator and browser control programmes at mainland sites in New Zealand. At Trounson Kauri Park (in Northland, New Zealand) feral cats, ferrets, stoats and weasels plus rodents and possums were controlled for two and a half years. Early results from Trounson suggested that some native birds and plants responded positively and quickly to the control of these alien pest mammals. However, the management also affected the predator-prey and predator-predator interactions, within the mammalian community, with changes in the predator guild and some prey species increasing in abundance. The long term effects of these responses within the mammalian community to control efforts are unclear. A review of the international literature served only to confirm the view that managing alien mammals where re-invasion is constant will be a complex task. Conservation management at mainland sites like Trounson Kauri Park, may in effect be acting as crude mammalian predator removal experiments. Monitoring changes in predator-prey interactions and predator-predator interactions at this and other intensive management sites over sufficient time frames could provide scientists with the critical ecological data required to construct useful predictive models. The ability of managers to target specific pests at critical times would represent a significant advancement in controlling predatory mammals on the New Zealand mainland.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-filterable metals (NFM) in the atmosphere</field><field name="creator">Ito, Masayoshi, 1967-</field><field name="description">A new air sampler, the Mist-UV sampling system, has been developed to trap and detect metals and metal compounds present in atmospheric samples, as non-filterable metal (NFM). The Mist-UV system is based on the combination of two ideas, mixing the filtrated air sample with nitric acid mist and simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation of the mist. Atmospheric NFM in the introduced air samples, which were first passed through a 0.2 &#181;m filter, were oxidised by UV irradiation and dissolved in the nitric acid mist. The trapped metals resulting from the NFM in nitric acid were quantitatively determined using ICP-MS. Using the Mist-UV system, measurements of atmospheric NFM concentrations were carried out to obtain their temporal and spatial trends in Auckland, New Zealand. Five metals (Mg, Al, Cu, Ba and Sr) were detected as NFM in ambient air. Elevated atmospheric concentrations of Mg, Cu, and Ba were detected in midsummer and in daytime samples. The UV oxidisable fraction dominated the NFM and high enrichment factors (EFcrust) were found for these metals. This suggested that natural emissions of organometals or reduced metals were responsible for the elevated atmospheric concentrations. Meteorological factors, particularly air temperature, light irradiation and rainfall, promoted biogenic activity and resultant NFM emissions. Remarkably high concentrations of Al and Sr as NFM were discovered in several air samples and were dominated by the non-oxidisable compounds. This implies that the sources of Al and Sr were mainly from inorganic or oxidised metals associated with fine particulates. Wet and dry soils appeared to be the sources of Mg+Ba and Al+Sr, respectively. Plant emissions are recognised as important sources of Mg, Cu and Ba as NFM in ambient air, whereas the suspension of fine particulates derived from road dust and soil enriched with non-oxidisable compounds are seen as the major sources of Al and Sr. The emissions from automobiles and seawater samples were found to be unimportant NFM sources. The NFM concentrations were found to be significantly higher than concentrations of particulate metals, therefore the atmospheric importance and role of NFM cannot be ignored in the estimation of global metal circulation and budgets.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restoration of threatened species populations: tuatara rehabilitations and re-introductions</field><field name="creator">Ussher, Graham</field><field name="description">The role of scientific theory in encouraging greater efficiency and accountability for the restoration of threatened species populations is assessed for an endemic New Zealand reptile, the tuatara Sphenodon spp. The value of examining assumptions underlying concepts such as 'habitat requirements' theory and incorporating scientific principles into species recovery are discussed and perceived habitat needs for tuatara tested through experimental application. Species restoration in New Zealand, especially re-introductions, are typically undertaken as one-off, non-replicated, management exercises (trials). The lack of comparative controls for trials means that the reason for success or failure of management actions cannot be identified accurately and therefore, cannot be used to improve the probability of success for subsequent re-introductions. Trials also reinforce conservative re-introductions of species to habitats in which species are known to survive, because the risk of failure is inherently lower than re-introductions to dissimilar habitats where habitat suitability is unknown. An alternative approach is to plan management actions as experiments. Testing the full range of perceived habitat needs of species as experimental comparisons identifies the relative importance of tested factors (e.g. predators, refuges) for species recovery and identifies new management strategies (e.g. reduced level of predator control). Constructing testable hypotheses for the environmental factors thought to affect the success of restoration projects for tuatara identifies (among others) three factors: 1. absence of the introduced rat, the kiore (Rattus exulans) 2. presence of seabird colonies 3. presence of open canopy forest The threat posed by kiore to established tuatara populations was investigated by determining the existence and degree of food competition before and after an eradication program for kiore on offshore islands. Kiore successfully out-competed tuatara for favoured food items, but the degree of competition differed between forest types. Competition for food was greater in the early regenerating forest than the mature forest. These data support models which propose that kiore are but one of a number of historical and current environmental factors influencing the persistence of native fauna and that management tools other than eradication may enable restoration of fauna in the presence of kiore. To test the importance of two environmental factors, forest development and the availability of refuges, in determining the establishment of new populations of tuatara, a planned experimental reintroduction was conducted on Moutohora Island. Tuatara were released into sites where the forest was young with a closed canopy and older with a more open canopy, and in sites where refuges (seabird burrows) were distributed evenly at high densities and where burrows clumped with few burrows between patches. Vegetation age and burrow dispersion had no measurable effect on the survivorship or condition of tuatara. Although tuatara released in areas where burrows were clumped dispersed significantly further from their release points and continued to disperse away from release sites throughout the study, tuatara in all release sites were considered to still be reproductively viable 16 months after the re-introduction. Therefore, sites which support open and closed canopy forest, and seabird burrows at high and low densities should be considered as habitat options for future reintroductions of tuatara. Testing habitat needs as well-planned experiments offer more reliable information to guide future reintroductions than that generated by trial releases or releases to similar locations. Future reintroductions of tuatara and other wildlife should be designed as experiments to test declared mixes of habitat factors. This will accelerate species recovery by identifying important habitat prerequisites for re-introduction and management options for achieving these, thus refining criteria used for selecting new sites and increasing confidence, efficiency and accountability of subsequent management actions. An example of designing re-introductions as experiments is included as a plan for the re-introduction of tuatara to Tiritiri Matangi Island.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herpatology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynological investigations into the early Quaternary and late Tertiary vegetation and climate of west Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Byrami, Mairie</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a detailed late Tertiary and early Quaternary pollen record from two c. 40 m long sedimentary cores (the Patiki cores) from west Auckland. The cores consist of slightly to highly carbonaceous clays, with a thick sand incursion at mid-depth. The sediments below the sand incursion are aged through palynostratigraphy as mid-late Pliocene (Hautawan). The sediments above the sand incursion have numerous interbedded tephras, and are aged through a combination of Isothermal Plateau Fission Track dating, palaeomagnetism and orbital tuning to the marine oxygen isotope record as 1.0 &#8211; 1.4 Ma (MIS 28 - 45, Marahauan substage). The Tertiary pollen record portrays regional vegetation assemblages of extinct Nothofagus brassii-type species and modern-day podocarps, with local modern-day oligotrophic mire assemblages. A cool climatic phase is indicated by a period of dominance of an extinct member of the Proteaceae. However, the duration of this interval cannot be determined due to a lack of numerical age control for the record. The Quaternary pollen record consists of mostly extant pollen types. It shows multiple compositional shifts from Nothofagus-dominated to conifer-dominated regional vegetation, with local oligotrophic mire vegetation except for a fully aquatic phase at mid-depth (MIS 35). The primary axis score curve of a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the pollen record was correlated to the marine isotope record, and shows that the Nothofagus-dominated intervals correspond to cool climate stages, while the conifer-dominated intervals correspond to warm stages. The strongest cool stage maximum is indicated at 12 - 13 m depth (MIS 34), where the vegetation consists of Fuscospora, Prumnopitys taxifolia and heath shrubs. The strongest warm stage maximum is indicated at c. 9 m depth (MIS 31) where the vegetation consists of Dacrydium forest. Astronomically forced climate change is an important driving force behind vegetation composition changes portrayed in the Quaternary pollen record. The majority of warm stage maxima inferred in the pollen record (conifer-dominated intervals) coincide with periods of maximum obliquity, and vice versa for inferred cool stage maxima (Nothofagus-dominated intervals). The modulating effect of eccentricity on precession is influential on the pollen record during MIS 31 and 34. The relationship between selected climate indicator taxa and calculated insolation values indicates that reduced seasonality in Auckland during warm climate stages favours Agathis, Dacrydium, Phyllocladus and Halocarpus, while increased seasonality during cool climate stages favours Nothofagus &#8216;fusca'-type, Nothofagus menziesii, and Prumnopitys taxifolia. In both situations the trees are probably responding to a combination of changes in mean global temperatures and seasonality, and reacting according to their own adaptive responses to astronomically driven climate change. The Quaternary pollen record contains plant mixtures that do not occur in New Zealand today, for example Agathis australis with Nothofagus menziesii, and Halocarpus bidwillii / biformis. The climate was probably cooler than it is in Auckland today, but never as cold as the last glacial maximum in Auckland when grasslands were present. Under more equable climatic conditions, with less extreme glacial and interglacial cycles, populations of comparably 'warm' and 'cool' climate taxa were probably able to shift throughout the region and mixed to a greater extent than is currently observed. The overall vegetation response to climate change (particularly above MIS 36) is analogous to that recorded in northern New Zealand in the late Pleistocene, and supports a negligible change in climatic preference of the main canopy species since the early Quaternary. The phytosociological idiosynchracies in the pollen record are not inconsistent with the known tolerance limits of the taxa involved, or with the individualistic nature of vegetation composition.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260113 Palynology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes</field><field name="creator">Salter, David Mark</field><field name="description">The chemistry of transition metal silyl complexes still remains relatively undeveloped despite the recent advances that have been made in this area. This thesis describes the synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes. A general survey on the bonding, preparation and reactivity of transition metal silyl complexes is given in chapter one as an introduction to the chemistry discussed in the following chapters. Several reviews relating to transition metal-silicon chemistry have been published, 1-5 and therefore only the major features and more recent developments are highlighted in this overview. Emphasis has been placed on those aspects not previously reviewed. Coordinatively unsaturated transition metal silyl complexes are uncommon and the chemistry of these complexes has been virtually unexplored. The synthesis of the novel coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes, M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os; R=Cl, alkyl group, alkoxy group), is described in chapter two. The reaction of M(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os) with a silane, in some instances, provided a facile, high yield route to complexes of the type M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru; SiR3=SiMe3, SiEt3, SiCl3, SiMe2Cl; M=Os; SiR3=SiCl3, SiMe2Cl). The chlorosily1 complexes were also prepared by treatment of MHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (M=Ru, Os) with HSiCl3 and HSiMe2Cl. X-ray crystal structures were obtained of Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and Os(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. Complexes containing chlorosily1 ligands proved synthetically useful, undergoing a variety of nucleophilic substitution reactions at silicon with retention of the transition metal-silicon bond. New complexes synthesized by this method included Ru[Si(OEt)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and Os(SiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. X-ray crystal structures of these two compounds were also obtained. These exchange reactions illustrate a route to new transition metal silyl compounds that has rarely been utilised. Also described in chapter two is the unprecedented formation of the novel compound Os(SiMe2C6H4PPh2)(C6H4PPh2)(CO)(PPh3), resulting from phenylation at silicon. The structure of this complex was determined by X-ray crystallography. In chapter three, addition of the Lewis bases CO and CN(p-tolyl) to coordinatively unsaturated silyl complexes, M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os), is described. The coordinatively saturated osmium silyl complexes Os(SiR3)Cl(CO)L(PPh3)2 (SiR3=SiCl3, SiMe2Cl, SiMe2OEt, SiMe3; L=CO, CNR) were generated in this way. Similarly, addition of 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine to Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 afforded Ru(siEt3)Cl(dimethylbipy)(CO)(PPh3). The six-coordinate complex Ru(SiEt3)(&#951;2-S2CNMe2)(CO)(PPh3)2 was synthesized by displacement of the labile chloride ligand from Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 by the dimethyldithiocarbamate anion. Characterization of Ru(SiEt3)(&#951;2-S2CNMe2)(CO)(PPh3)2 included an X-ray crystallographic analysis. The exchange of silyl groups at the metal was also observed in several reactions. For example, heating Ru(SiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 in the presence of excess HSiEt3 yielded Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. These reactions illustrate aspects of the chemistry that can occur at the metal centre of coordinatively unsaturated transition metal silyl complexes. Another route to coordinatively saturated osmium silyl complexes was via oxidative addition of a silane to Os(CO)2(PPh3)3, which yielded Os(SiR3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2 (SiR3=SiMe3, SiEt3, SiPh3, SiPh2H). The synthesis of these complexes is also discussed in chapter three. An X-ray crystal structure determination of Os(SiEt3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2 confirmed the presence of mutually trans carbonyl ligands. The first thiocarbonyl-containing transition metal silyl complexes, M(SiMe2Cl)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os), were prepared by treating M(Ph)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 or MHCl(CS)(PPh3)3 with HSiMe2Cl. The Si-Cl bond in these compounds reacted readily with nucleophiles, yielding M(SiMe2OR)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (OR=OEt, OMe, OH). In contrast to the addition of CO to Os(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, addition of CO to Ru(SiMe2R)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (R=Cl, OEt, OMe, OH) and to Os(SiMe2OEt)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 afforded dihapto-thioacyl complexes, M[&#951;2-C(S)SiMe2R]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, via a migratory insertion reaction involving the silyl group and the thiocarbonyl ligand. This reaction represents the first formal insertion of CS into a transition metal-silicon bond. The structure of Ru[&#951;2-C(S)SiMe2OEt]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was obtained by X-ray crystallography and confirmed that bonding of the thioacyl ligand occurred in a dihapto fashion. These reactions are described in chapter four. When Os(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was reacted with HSiMe3, the formally osmium(IV) silyl complex Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 was produced. Few compounds of this type are known. The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 are discussed in chapter five. The crystal structure of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 is also depicted. In solution, Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 appeared to be in equilibrium with the highly reactive, coordinatively unsaturated species OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. The reaction of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 with HSiR3 (R=Et, Ph), HSn(p-tolyl)3 and HC2Ph was carried out, using Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 as an in situ source of OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. These reactions afforded Os(SiR3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 (R=Et, Ph), Os[Sn(p-tolyl)3]2H2(CO)(PPh3)2 and OsH(C2Ph)(CO)(PPh3)3 respectively, most likely via a series of oxidative addition-reductive elimination reactions involving OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. Transition metal hydroxysilyl complexes are extremely rare. Only three systems have been reported containing a hydroxysilyl group bonded to a transition metal. 6,7,8 Chapter six deals with the formation of compounds of this type. Hydroxysilyl-containing complexes of ruthenium and osmium were obtained via the hydrolysis of M(SiMe2Cl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and M(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. The complexes M[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 are the first trihydroxysilyl-containing transition metal complexes and therefore represent a new class of transition metal silyl compounds. Characterization of Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 included an X-ray crystal structure which showed that, remarkably, no inter- or intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of the type O(H)&#183;&#183;&#183;O or O(H) &#183;&#183;Cl was associated with the Si(OH)3 group. In contrast, intermolecular hydrogen bonding was found by X-ray crystallography for the dicarbonyl derivative, Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)2(PPh3)2. Subsequent reactions involving Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 led to the synthesis of the diosmium tetrahydroxydisiloxane complex, [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O. For example, [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O was isolated after Os(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was added to a dichloromethane solution of Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. Formation of this tetrahydroxydisiloxane compound is significant and models the first condensation reaction generating a Si-O-Si linkage in the hydrolysis of organochlorosilanes to polysiloxanes. The Si-O-Si linkage was clearly visible in the X-ray crystal structure of [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O. Chapter seven provides a short conclusion, highlighting the important features of the work discussed in this thesis and identifies areas for future investigation.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum interactions of light and atoms: squeezing of light by atoms and cooling of atoms by light</field><field name="creator">Blockley, Craig Andrew</field><field name="description">Light and atoms couple together via the electromagnetic interaction. The simplest form of this interaction is the electric dipole interaction, and in its quantised form it provides a useful starting point for the investigation of quantum effects in optics. Two examples of quantum noise manipulation of the light field due to interaction with atoms will be presented, as well as an analysis of a simple model for laser cooling of trapped atoms. The first example of quantum noise manipulation is the investigation of a quantum non-demolition measurement scheme based on a three-level atomic system in the ladder configuration. An effective two-level model of the atomic system is used, which enables the inclusion of spontaneous emission noise from the upper atomic level. The system is found to perform well, when detuned far from resonance. The second example is the treatment of squeezing in the intensity difference between two modes coupled by a three-level atomic system in the ladder configuration. The noise correlations are similar to those occurring in the optical parametric oscillator, and give rise to good squeezing when the system is well detuned from the intermediate level. The simple model of laser cooling consists of a single two-level atom with quantised centre-of-mass motion constrained to move in a one-dimensional harmonic potential while interacting with a single-mode classical travelling light field. It is shown that there is an analogy between this model and the Jaynes-Cummings model. This gives rise to interesting coherent effects including quantum collapses and revivals in the atomic inversion. Sideband cooling occurs for this model when the light field is tuned to the atom's first lower vibrational sideband. The strong sideband and Lamb-Dicke perturbation regimes are defined. Analytic results have previously been obtained for the latter regime, but we carry out a numerical investigation of the steady state and time evolution behaviour in the former regime. Differences in the behaviour in the two regimes are discussed. Finally the possibility of observing quantum jumps between trap levels is discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The AP integral</field><field name="creator">Liao, Kecheng</field><field name="description">This study attempts to develop the theory surrounding a controlled convergence theorem in the setting of AP integration.

Parametric models are used to estimate optimal conditions for the presence of species and to test several niche theory hypotheses. An extension of GAMs called vector GAMs is proposed, and they provide a means for proposing nonparametric versions of the following models: multivariate regression, the proportional and nonproportional odds model, the multiple logistic regression model, and bivariate binary regression models such as bivariate probit model and the bivariate logistic model.

The observed pseudo-first-order rate coefficients of cyclisation of several model 2-aminoaryl-acetamides and propanamides have been measured. Cyclisation was observed to be strongly influenced by stereochemistry, whereas electron withdrawal from the amine-bearing ring resulted in a comparatively modest slowing of the rate of cyclisation. Protonation of the leaving group appeared to increase the rate of cyclisation, while changes in 4-substitution on the leaving amine had little effect on this rate. The cyclisation of 2-(2-aminophenyl) alkanamides was found to be subject to general catalysis by acidic buffer components, and rate determining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed. Ring closure reactions of several 2-hydroxylaminophenylalkanamides have been studied by &#947;-radiolysis. HPLC methods have been developed for the separation of reduction and cyclisation products. Reduction stoichiometry implicates the hydroxylamine as the predominant reduction product of radiolysis of the 2-nitrophenylalkanamide precursors, which varied in the nature of substitution of the nitrobenzyl ring, 4-substitution of the leaving aniline, and overall geometry. Cyclisation via the hydroxylamino was observed to be significantly faster than that of its amino counterparts, and was similarly influenced by changes in geometry. The hydroxylamine undergoes a base catalysed, oxygen dependent reaction under aerobic conditions. This reaction did not appear to be influenced by the geometry of the compound. Substitution of the hydroxylamine-bearing ring with a carboxamide group (CONHR &#963;p = 0.36) lowered the pH at which hydroxylamino-amide cyclisation was slowest, compared with its unsubstituted counterpart. The reaction was found to be aided by electron-withdrawal from the leaving amine. Rate determining breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed. Preliminary investigations have been made on 2-nitrophenyl alkyl esters and a 2,6-dinitrophenylamide prodrug system. Rapid, reductively triggered release of coupled phenols and amines has been observed from the nitro-esters and -amides, respectively. In contrast to amino-amide and hydroxylamino-amide cyclisation, gem-dimethyl substitution did not facilitate reductive release from the nitro-ester. The inability to measure the rates of reductive release in radiolysis solutions suggests that these reactions occur significantly faster than hydroxylamino-amide ring closure. Molecular mechanics calculations have been undertaken to investigate relationships between the geometry of 2-aminoarylalkanamides, and rates of cyclisation. The distance between, and angle of approach of the nucleophilic and electrophilic centres in the calculated minimum-energy conformer did not display a correlation with cyclisation rates.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-resolution measurements of rainfall</field><field name="creator">Hosking, J. G. (John G.)</field><field name="description">A field system capable of making high-resolution measurements of rainfall is described. The system incorporates a disdrometer, an array of high-resolution raingauges, a general-purpose data acquisition system and ancillary equipment. In an evaluation of the disdrometer, a theory allowing calculation of the effects of windspeed on detection efficiency is presented which has wide applicability. The raingauges are an improved design allowing 10-s temporal resolution of rainfall intensity and 100 m spatial resolution of rain-patch size when used in the array. An extensive data base of measurements made using the field system is described. Duration of rainfall is shown to be approximately log-normal and is consistent with a log-normal distribution of precipitation region size. The fractional duration of rainfall above a threshold intensity varies considerably between rain periods, a result which may be important for electromagnetic attenuation models. Estimation of the shapes of rain patches using the raingauge array is demonstrated and shows considerable promise. Raindrop fallspeeds, measured using the disdrometer, generally show much less deviation from stagnant air terminal velocities than indicated by previously reported results. Much of the spread in the results is shown to be consistent with instrumentation errors although significant residual deviations are still apparent; the fallspeeds are generally slower than stagnant air values would suggest. Measurements of the arrival rate of raindrops at the disdrometer indicate clustering of drops rather than the often assumed Poisson distribution. The clustering is associated with small drops and has reasonable correlation with rainfall intensity. Examination of the cross-correlation of arrival rates of different sized drops show results in contradiction to previous results; small drops are found to lead other sized drops. Using a normalisation method, the shapes of raindrop size distributions measured are shown to be depressed in the mid-radius region.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Oxidation of Aromatic Steroids</field><field name="creator">Manning, Terence David Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned primarily with a study of the oxidation of aromatic steroids employing either chromium trioxide-aqueous acetic acid or chromium trioxide-aqueous sulphuric acid-acetone mixtures. The nature of the chromic acid oxidation of various functional groups is discussed first and this is followed by an outline of the two methods used for the synthesis of the aromatic steroids which were oxidised in this study. The second part of the discussion deals with the oxidation of these aromatic steroids. It was found that chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids containing a strong electron-donating C3-substituent, such as methoxyl, gave the corresponding 9-hydroxy-11-oxo derivative (ketol). However, a ketol was not formed if a C3-methoxyl substituted ring-A aromatic steroid also contained a substituent at C1. When a C3-methoxyl substituent was present, the 6-oxo-ring-A aromatic steroid was a minor oxidation product but such compounds were the major products from the chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids containing a weak C3-electron-donating group, such as acetoxyl. The oxidation of a ring-A aromatic steroid containing a C2-methoxyl substituent gave an almost quantitative yield of the corresponding 6-oxo compound. Suzuki103 has claimed that the major oxidation product of 17&#946;-acetoxy-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-triene (34b) is 17 &#946;-acetoxy-9&#945;- hydroxy-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-11-one (123). Physical and chemical evidence are presented to show that this product is in fact the 9&#946;-hydroxy epimer and a reaction pathway for its formation is proposed. An examination of the oxidation products of a ring-B aromatic steroid and a ring-C aromatic steroid shows that no ketols were formed.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picosecond Pulse Generation and Propagation in Erbium Doped Optical Fibres</field><field name="creator">Bollond, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the generation of picosecond pulses and their propagation through both resonant and non-resonant media. This was achieved by constructing a passively modelocked Erbium doped fibre laser (EDFL) which was used to study pulse propagation through sections of standard communications grade optical fibre, dispersion shifted optical fibre, and also through an Erbium doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) module. The EDFL produced a train of &#732;2 psec pulses at 4 MHz, tunable over the erbium gain band ( 1520 - 1570 nm). The laser was constructed from commercially available components and had the property of stability combined with low pump power requirements to produce &#732;50 Watt peak power pulses. The laser cavity geometry included a nonlinear optical loop mirror, which has the property of efficiently switching high peak power pulses, and allowed pulsed operation without the aid of any high-speed electronics. An EDFA module of identical geometry to that used in the laser was also constructed, and this was probed using the pulses from the EDFL. The traditional temporal and spectral measurements were found to be inadequate to allow a complete description of the pulse amplification process to be developed. To overcome this problem the technique of frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) was applied for the first time to optical fibre research, and allowed an indirect measurement of the electric field of the pulse. This complete description of the pulse was used in a numerical model to describe pulse propagation in an optical fibre. Fundamental propagation terms in the model were treated as free parameters in a minimisation scheme, which could be determined for a fibre under examination. This technique was shown to be accurate when used to examine pulse propagation through both standard and dispersion shifted optical fibre. A comprehensive numerical model was developed for the EDFA, and it was apparent from this model that a pulse propagating through an optimised EDFA encounters an atomic inversion distribution which is a strong function of distance along the amplifying fibre. It was also shown from the experimental results that the EDFA exhibited resonant dispersion, which is characteristic for propagation through an atomic medium on resonance.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the synthesis of anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Boniface, Peter James</field><field name="description">The Claisen rearrangement of 1,4-bis(prop-2'-enyloxy)anthraquinone under reducing conditions is investigated.

The acid catalysed rearrangement of abietic acid afforded two isomeric dienes the structures of which have been elucidated. Compounds containing the diene functionality were found to be unstable. However, removal of the diene system afforded stable compounds which are suited to further synthetic modification. Although the skeletal features possessed by a class of amber odorants were successfully introduced stereochemical control proved difficult. The stereochemistry of two intermediates was unambiguosly assigned by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The second chapter describes the successful conversion of totarol into conjugated dienolides possessing the B/C-ring present in type A and type C nagilactones. Consequently totarol may be considered as a useful model for the preparation of the biologically active nagilactones. In the course of this work several unusual rearrangements were observed. The products of rearrangement were characterised by 2-D n.m.r. and single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments and reaction mechanisms are proposed. The third chapter of this thesis reports the synthesis of the amber odorant, &#947;-bicyclohomofarnesal, from podocarpic acid. Analogues in which C-19 is functionalised were also prepared. However these compounds were odorless.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FTIR studies of surface adsorption on noble metal hydrosols</field><field name="creator">Mucalo, Michael Roger</field><field name="description">Carbon monoxide adsorption, surface speciation and particle size distributions have been studied in platinum, palladium, and rhodium hydrosol systems using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In transmission electron micrographs of unprotected platinum and palladium hydrosols, particle necklacing believed to arise from sintering during preparation, is apparent. The average particle sizes of all hydrosols studied were in the range of 2 to 12 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the metal hydrosols revealed evidence for (Pt-O)ads, Pt(II) and Pt(IV) oxides on platinum hydrosol particles whereas Pd(II) and Pd(IV) oxides were detected on the surfaces of palladium hydrosol particles. These surface oxides are found to be important in influencing hydrosol surface processes such as CO adsorption as a function of pH, inhibition of CO adsorption by alcohols and surface corrosion products resulting from the addition of iodide and cyanide. Fourier transform infrared spectra of CO-treated metal hydrosols revealed bands due to CO linearly adsorbed on the metal particles at ca. 2070 cm-1 (Pt), 2067 cm-1 (Pd) and 2045 cm-1 (Rh) whereas bands due to bridge-adsorbed (B2) CO were detected at ca.1950 cm-1 (Pd) and 1890 cm-1 (Rh). The use of CO as a spectroscopic probe molecule enabled the study of changes in the surface properties of the metal hydrosols which were induced by changes in the dispersion medium. For example, v(CO)ads was observed to decrease in infrared spectra of CO-treated platinum and rhodium hydrosols as pH was increased by KOH or other dissolved salts yielding alkaline solutions. This suggested a reduction in CO coverage resulting from hydroxyl adsorption and consequent increased oxide growth on the particles. In contrast, CO adsorption on platinum and rhodium hydrosols was enhanced in acidic media possibly as a result of the neutralisation of surface hydroxyls. The spectroscopic behaviour of adsorbed CO on platinum and rhodium hydrosols was only comparable to that of CO adsorbed at an electrode surface in acidic media when protecting agent was present which prevented aggregation of the hydrosol in such media. Inhibition of CO adsorption on platinum hydrosols was induced by the addition of aliphatic alcohols, poly(vinyl alcohol) and poisoning anions such as CN- and SH-. Correlations of v(CO)ads with CO coverage suggested that island formation of adsorbed CO was occurring for CO adsorption on unprotected palladium hydrosols and protected platinum and rhodium hydrosols as a function of pH. In allied investigations, an infrared spectroelectrochemical study of corrosion of a nickel electrode in aqueous cyanide media has revealed that [Ni(CN)4]2- is detected at potentials more cathodic than 200 mV vs. SCE. Cyanide was oxidised to cyanate (OCN-) and then successively to carbon dioxide at potentials more anodic than 200 mV vs. SCE. The appearance of features at 2094 cm-1 (HCN) and 2256 cm-1 (HNCO) were attributed to pH changes associated with the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate. The appearance of a band at ca. 2218 cm-1 in infrared spectra of the thin layer at very high potentials (&gt; 1000 mV vs. SCE) was believed to arise from an unstable nickel(II) isocyanate complex.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherent transient phenomena in the mode-locked argon laser</field><field name="creator">Dudley, John Michael</field><field name="description">An investigation has been carried out into the operation of a mode-locked argon laser at a wavelength of 514.5 nm and a repetition rate of 76.8 MHz. The characteristics of the pulses from the laser have been found to depend on the intra-cavity power level in the laser, and at average intra-cavity power levels exceeding 4 W, the pulses from the laser have a duration of typically 35 psec accompanied by a characteristic double-peaked spectrum with a spectral width of 13 GHz These pulse durations are approximately three times shorter than expected based on the inhomogeneously broadened transition bandwidth of 4 GHz. The dependence of the pulse characteristics on the intra-cavity power level has been explained by a model of pulse propagation where the coherent coupling between the pulse and the atomic polarisation in the laser gain medium is included. Detailed examination of the pulse structure reveals the presence of afterpulses that have a typical intensity two orders of magnitude lower than the main pulse. These afterpulses are interpreted as ringing arising from coherent Rabi-type oscillation of the atomic polarisation associated with the circulating pulse in the laser. Numerical simulations of the mode-locked laser have also been developed based on the fully coherent Maxwell-Bloch equations, and the results from the simulations reproduce well the experimentally observed variation in pulse characteristics. Based on results from the simulations, the short pulses observed at high intra-cavity powers are interpreted as the superfluorescent &#960; &#8211;pulse solutions predicted in the long distant limit of pulse propagation in a swept-gain amplifying medium. The laser operation has also been studied in a mode-locked cavity dumped configuration. In this case the combination of the coherent mode-locking processes described above with the cavity dumped operation at a repetition rate of 3.8 MHz results in the observation of stable pulses with peak power of 1.6 kW.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric syntheses of anthraquinonyl C-glycosides</field><field name="creator">Bercich, Mark David</field><field name="description">Syntheses of C2-anthraquinone aldehydes from the commercially available anthrarufin 11 have been investigated. A synthesis of the ketoaldehyde 5 in nine steps and 73% overall yield was achieved. Syntheses of 5 exploiting selective oxidations of either a C-bound allyl group via Wacker oxidation to introduce the methyl ketone functionality, or of a C-bound prop-l-enyl moiety via dihydroxylation and oxidative cleavage to generate the C2 formyl group were also developed. The aldehyde 81 was synthesised in seven steps and 81% overall yield from ll, and syntheses of the phenolic aldehydes 82, 95, and 96, the Cl benzyloxyaldehyde 104, and the anthracene aldehyde 107 have been developed. Hetero Diels-Alder reactions of several anthraquinone aldehydes with the dienes 6,120, and 121 using catalysis by the complex (+)-VO(hfc)2 115 were studied. Reactions of the aldehydes 5 and 81 proceeded readily using catalytic amounts of 115 and dichloromethane, chloroform, or toluene as solvent to give the adducts 128 or 131 indicating an endo selective pericyclic reaction pathway. The enantioselectivites of these reactions were typically 20-50%, with a best ee of 56% for a reaction between 81 and 6 catalysed by 0.2 equivalents of 115 at -78&#176;C. Reactions of the 1-silyloxydienes 120 and 121 with aldehyde 8l catalysed by 115 to give the enone 130 also proceeded readily with a best ee of 64% being obtained for a reaction between 81 and l2l in toluene at -78&#176;C. Reactions of the phenolic aldehydes 95 and 96 and the diene 6, catalysed by 115, afforded good yields of cycloadducts, but with enantioselectivities identical to equivalent reactions of the aldehyde 81. However reactions of the Cl benzyloxyaldehyde 104 with the dienes 6 and 120, and 121 afforded cycloadducts with enantioselectivities lower than those from the equivalent reactions of the aldehyde 81. Elaboration of the cycloadduct 131 to the anthracene C-glycoside 149 established that the hetero Diels-Alder reaction had favoured the formation of the 2'R, 6'R enantiomer of 131. This enantiofacial selectivity was correlated with the sense of anisochrony observed in 1H NMR spectra of the ketone 129, derived from 131, in the presence of the chiral solvating agent (S)(+)-trifluoroanthrylethanol. The enone 130 was elaborated to the anthraquinone-olivose C-glycoside 154 demonstrating the utility of hetero Diels-Alder reactions involving silyloxydienes with Cl silyloxy and Cl methyl substituents for such syntheses. Attempts to use chiral acyloxyborane comploxes such as 168 and 169 as catalysts for hetero Diels-Alder reactions of the aldehydes 5, 81 and 107 with the dienes 6 and 120 were unsuccessful. However two equivalents of the chiral acyloxyborane complex 168a in dichloromethane at 30&#176;C, mediated. a formal hetero Diels-Alder reaction between 81 and 120 affording the enone 13O in 45% yield, with a 79% ee in favour of the 6'R enantiomer. Reactions catalysed by the chiral acyloxyborane complex 169b between beenzaldehyde or o-anisaldehyde and the dienes 6,119, and 120 gave products resulting from a Mukaiyama aldol addition rather than a hetero Diels-Alder reaction. Hetero Diels-Alder reactions 81 and 120 employing the chiral titanium complexes Ti[(R)-BINOL]C12, Ti[(R)-BINOL]2, and Ti[R,R)-TADDOL]C12 were investigated. No reaction was observed when 0.5, 1.2 and 2 equivalents of Ti[(R)-BINOL]2 were used. However the complexes Ti[(R)-BINOL]C12 and Ti[(R,R)-TADDOL]C12 promoted the reaction between 81 and 120 at -30&#176;C and -78&#176;C, but induced low enantioselectivities (17-30%)</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Annulations of diterpenoids via organomanganese and organoiron complexes</field><field name="creator">Metzler, Michael Reinhold</field><field name="description">Chapter One of this Thesis reports an investigation of the synthesis of diterpenoids (as potential ligands for cyclomanganation reactions) from podocarpic acid, and one from dehydroabietic acid. A number of monocyclic aromatic and chalcone derivatives were synthesised to act as model compounds in the subsequent complexation reactions. The second chapter describes successful complexations of the above ligands containing aldehyde, ketone, ester, or oxime groups as directing functionalities to form the resulting tetracarbonylmanganese sigma adducts in moderate to excellent yield. Attempted complexation of amide-containing ligands proved generally to be unsuccessful. Complexation of ligands containing either two potential sites for manganation or two potential ligating groups were investigated and the structures of the isolated complexes established unequivocally by N.M.R. spectroscopy or by X-ray crystallography. Chapter Three describes the successful coupling reactions of the tetracarbonylmanganese complexes with ethene and with substituted electron-poor olefins to give pentaannulated derivatives of podocarpic acid in very good yields. The stereochemistry of two cyclised alcohols was assigned unambiguously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. Various methods of activating the tetracarbonyl complexes were investigated, including chemical oxidation, and palladium(II)-mediated or thermally-promoted reactions. Two of the pentaannulated adducts were converted successfully into benzannulated analogues in good yield. Analogous coupling reactions of the activated complexes with ethyne and substituted alkynes are discussed in Chapter Four. Chapter Five reports an investigation of the reactions of the tetracarbonylmanganese complexes with halogen electrophiles such as Br2, ICl, or ICl3. When these reactions were performed in non-protic solvents the corresponding aryl halides were isolated in moderate to excellent yield. However, in protic solvents carbonyl insertion occurred to afford &#947;-lactones in very good yield. The stereochemistry of one of these lactones was assigned unambiguously by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. Oxidative cleavage of the C-Mn bond with a number of reagents proved generally to be unsuccessful, the isolation of oxygenated diterpenoids being observed only from reaction with Pb(OAc)4. Chapter Six describes various attempts at functionalising ring C of podocarpic acid derivatives via alternative methods to cyclomanganation.

Spectroscopy and of Rearrangement Mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Baker, Kenneth Matthew</field><field name="description">Part 1. Some aspects of NMR spectroscopy: A review of coupling mechanisms is given and notable examples of long range coupling in the literature are discussed. Methyl protons can undergo long range coupling with protons which are 4s bonds away, and the mechanism of this process as related to the known examples is discussed. The effects of electronegative substituents on long range coupling is also outlined.  A Discussion of the present work follows, wherein the description of the preparation of many bornane derivatives, including several deuterated derivatives, is presented. The line widths (Wh/2) of the methyl groups were measured. It was found that the width of the methyl groups decreased in the order C8&gt;C9&gt;C10, and the C8 and C9 methyl signals were always appreciably broader than the C10. Long range coupling between the protons of the C8 and C9 methyl groups is postulated as being responsible for those two being broader than C10. Long range coupling between the C8 methyl protons and the C5 and C6 endo protons, and between the C9 methyl and the C3 endo proton is tentatively ascribed to the differences in the widths of the C8 and C9 methyl groups. Although the line widths of the tertiary methyls were found to vary with solvent, the relative widths of the three methyl signals of the bornane derivatives was found to be the same. Thus measurement of line widths is a method of correlating the methyl signals in spectra run in different solvents. The effects on the chemical shifts of the tertiary methyl groups of bornanes when various substituents are placed in the basic skeleton, is also described. The presence of an ethylenedioxy group at C2 or C3 results in a desheilding of C8 and a shielding of C9, while introduction of hydroxyl groups has no uniform effect because of different orientations of the hydroxyl group from compound to compound.  An introduction to the mechanism of benzene induced solvent shifts is given. Benzene appears to form a stereospecific complex with ketones, and other molecules, which can undergo a dipole-induced dipole-interaction. The effects of this interaction on the n.m.r. spectra of various ketones, quinones and aromatic compounds is described. The present work describes the measurement of solvent shifts at various concentrations of ketones and ketals in benzene. Previous similar work is discussed in the light of the results obtained, and it has been shown that some assumptions previously used in correlating the data with the interactions, have been unjustified. The solvent shifts versus the concentration have been plotted to give curves which have been interpreted as indicating specific solvent-solute interactions, i.e. 1:1, 1:2, etc., and not random associations. This has been shown by comparing calculated curves with the experimental results, with which agreement is good. The third part of this section of the work deals with the spectra of some hydroxymethylene ketones, and commences with an introduction to the general behaviour of 1,3-diketones in solution. The rates of exchange of enolizable protons is discussed, and their use in determining the relative proportions of enol forms is outlined. The present work describes the behaviour of 3-formylbornan-2-one in carbontetrachloride-D2O solution, and an explanation for the preference for one enol form is given. Also discussed is the coupling between &#8216;formyl&#8217; and hydroxyl protons in hydroxymethylene ketones, and it is shown that the coupling depends strongly on the H-O-C-H angle, which can be altered by slight changes in molecular geometry, thus leading to changes in coupling constants. No change in coupling constants caused by temperature differences was observed, and it is speculated that exchange processes do not affect the value of the coupling constant, but only whether coupling occurs. Part 2: Acid catalysed rearrangements in cyclic systems  A comprehensive review of the dienone-phenol rearrangement is given and it is shown that any cross-conjugated cyclohexadienone will rearrange to an aromatic product, the substitution of which depends strongly on (i) the substitution pattern of the original dienone, (ii) peculiarities in the molecular structure, and (iii) the rearrangement conditions. Rearrangements of some dienols and some cross-conjugated methylenecyclohexadienes or &#8216;semibenzenes&#8217; are described, and in general these follow the pattern of the dienone-phenol rearrangement. Rearrangement of some steroidal &#945;-substituted ketones is also mentioned briefly. Two cross-conjugated methylenecyclohexadienes were synthesised by reaction of methylmagnesium iodide on the corresponding dienones &#8211; this reaction had previously been reported to give only the products of rearrangement of the intermediate semibenzenes. The semibenzenes were rearranged using perchloric acid in acetic anhydride-ethyl acetate to give the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic product. The attacking species was shown to be a proton, and the reaction, unlike the dienone-phenol rearrangement, showed a clear preference for methylene rather than methyl migration. Several methyl substituted steroidal 2&#945;-hydroxy-4-en-3-ones were prepared by the rearrangement of the corresponding 4,5-epoxy-3-ones with sulphuric acid in aqueous acetone, herein shown to be a general method. The hydroxyenones were rearranged using three sets of conditions: Toluene-p-sulphonic acid in methanol, toluene-p-sulphonic acid in benzene, and perchloric acid in acetic anhydride-ethyl acetate. Only one compound, 2&#945;-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one gave an aromatic product; the other substrates underwent rearrangement through the various enols, to give attack usually at C6 of the carbon skeleton. A mechanism is given and discussed for each rearrangement. No general pattern seemed to emerge.  Part 3: The Clemmensen reduction of 1,3-diketones  A review of the Clemmensen reduction is given with a specific reference to reduction of difunctional compounds, where rearrangements may occur. The present work shows that in the Clemmensen reduction of 1,3-diketones, the intermediate cyclopropanediol which is first formed, undergoes acidolysis to give an &#945;-hydroxy ketone and a &#946;-hydroxy ketone, each of which may then undergo further Clemmensen reduction to give the observed rearranged and unrearranged monoketones. The intermediacy of a &#946;-hydroxy ketone was proved by observing the rate of formation of the products, and by measuring the rate of reduction of an independently synthesised &#945;-hydroxy ketone. Reduction of two acyclic ketones was shown to give a ring expanded product only in the case of 2-acetylcyclopentanone. Part 4: Intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions from aromatic alkyl groups  A short resume of intramolecular hydrogen reactions using lead tetraacetate or the hypoiodite process is given, with some detail being applied to the conditions, and the stereochemistry needed for the reaction, and to fragmentation processes which may occur. Brief mention is also made of the new reaction; hydrogen abstraction using decomposition of a hypobromite with silver ions. The lead tetraacetate reaction was applied without success to abstraction of hydrogen from an aromatic methyl group, utilizing an &#945;-benzylic hydroxyl group. Fragmentation reactions were generally obtained. Application of the bromine-silver ion method gave good yields of cyclic ethers in two cases, indicating that an abstraction reaction had taken place. The conditions for such a reaction seem to be critical: A tertiary hydroxyl group is required, and the abstraction seems only to take place from a primary centre.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Satellite Observations of Irregularities in the Antarctic Ionosphere</field><field name="creator">Stuart, George F. , 1940</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 Introduction.

J.</field><field name="description">This is the first study of cretaceous or Paleogene Radiolaria from on-land New Zealand. It is based on five Late Cretaceous to Paleocene sections within the Amuri Limestone Group of eastern Marlborough (NE South Island): Woodside Creek, Wharanui Point, Chancet Rocks, Flaxbourne River and Mead Stream. Faunas from coeval sediments at DSDP Site 208 (Lord Howe Rise, north Tasman Sea) are also reexamined. Because diverse and well-preserved radiolarian faunas are common, the location of the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary well-documented, and the earliest Paleocene relatively complete, these sections provide the most complete known record of radiolarian evolution from latest Cretaceous to mid Late Paleocene (c.70-60 Ma). Systematic treatment of K-T transitional faunas was hampered by a dichotomy between Cenozoic and Mesozoic methodologies and nomenclature. To resolve this schism, broad taxonomic definitions are adopted, numerous synonymies are identified, and several revised definitions are proposed for established taxa. Of the 94 taxa recorded, 65 are species or species groups, and 29 are undifferentiated genera or higher level categories. Three new species are described: Amphisphaera aotea n.sp., A. kina n.sp. and Stichomitra wero n.sp. A new latest Cretaceous to mid Late Paleocene zonation is proposed. Six new interval zones are defined by the first appearances of the nominated species. In ascending order these are: Lithomelissa? hoplites (RK9, Cretaceous), Amphisphaera aotea (RP1, Paleocene), A. kina (RP2), Stichomitra granulata (RP3), Buryella foremanae (RP4) and B. tetradica (RP5) Interval Zones. The Late Paleocene Bekoma campechensis Zone of Nishimura (1987) succeeds RP5 at Mead Stream. The K/T boundary does not mark an extinction event for radiolarians, but does coincide with a sudden change from nassellarian to spumellarian dominance. It also coincides with a sudden influx of diatoms in Marlborough, where a fall in sea level appears to have promoted upwelling. Thus, rather than marking a catastrophe, the K/T boundary heralded a period (from RP1 to lower RP3) of great productivity for siliceous plankton. With a return to conditions similar to those of the Cretaceous, later in the Paleocene (upper RP3-RP6), Cretaceous survivors were rapidly replaced by new Tertiary taxa in deep-water settings. However, in shallower settings, many Cretaceous taxa remained abundant throughout the Early Paleocene. Faunal changes at site 208 are similar to those of the deep-water Marlborough sections, but without clear evidence for increased fertilty in the earliest Paleocene.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel synthetic anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Holroyd, Stephen Eyre</field><field name="description">Lewis acid mediated cyclisations of the ortho allyl substituted homochiral hydroxyanthraquinone acetals (37), (38), (43), and (44), prepared via optimised reductive Claisen rearrangements have been investigated. The mono and dichloro tetracyclic species (71-74), (76), (77), (83), (84), (87-90) and novel dioxepins (97), (98), (101), (102) have been synthesised and their stereochemistries assigned using NMR techniques. Mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of most of the products. An SN2-like process in which the dioxolane ring structure is maintained in an ion pair intermediate is favoured when tin(IV) or titanium(IV) chloride are used at lower temperatures (-78&#176;C). Such a path explains the good C7 stereoselectivity in the generation of the anthracyclinones. Thereafter the direction of chloride addition is governed by the orientation of this ion pair which provides the chloride to C-9 on the A-ring. An alternative path predominates when boron trifluoride etherate is used and at higher temperatures. This probably involves a free oxocarbenium ion which explains the poor C7 stereoselectivity, since either face of the oxocarbenium ion is equally accessible to the incoming nucleophilic olefin. An adjacent methoxy group on the anthraquinone ring lowers the stereoselectivity at both C7 and C9. This effect is explained by invoking bidentate coordination of either tin(IV) or titanium(IV) chloride to the quinone carbonyl, the methoxy oxygen and the acetal. The resultant steric interactions raise the energy of the favoured transition state and thus the acetal reacts via a different conformation, or the SN1-like path may be favoured, both of which afford a lower stereoselectivity. When titanium(IV) chloride is used with the isobutylene substituted methoxy anthraquinonyl acetal (37) a reversal in C7 stereoselectivity is found which has been explained as due to a favouring of reaction in which the other acetal oxygen has become complexed. With these substrates trimethylsilyl triflate does not induce the desired acetal/alkene cyclisation, rather the isobutylene substituted acetals (37) and (38) giving the dimethyl furans (68) and (69), while the vinyl chlorides (43) and (44) were largely unreactive. Preliminary studies on modifications aimed at introducing oxygen bearing functionality at C9 in the mono and dichloro tetracyclic species have been carried out. The potential of the acetal from condensation of the conduritol dimethyl ether (140) and the aldehyde (35) in syntheses of novel anthracyclines bearing a 7-cyclitol substituent has been studied. The cyclohexenyl acetals (143), (153), (154), and (157) have been prepared but their reactions with a variety of Lewis acids give the appropriate napthacenediones (67), (91), (133), and (155) as the only tetracyclic products isolated. It is proposed that coordination of the &#945;-methoxy groups to the Lewis acid diverts the reaction paths. A one-pot reductive Claisen/Ene reaction of the aldehyde (35) has been optimised as a method for preparing the tetracyclic anthracyclinone (163). Further modifications of this tetracycle have been investigated. Preliminary studies of a route aimed at utilising a Dieckmann condensation to furnish anthracyclinone precursors were side-tracked when rather than the desired furans an iodoetherification reaction gave a series of novel iodomethylfurans and furanocyclopropanes. The use of palladium(II) bisacetonitrile to simultaneously cleave the allyl ether and conjugate the C-allyl double bond of (33) to afford (217) has been investigated.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

Ozonolysis of podocarpic acid gave the 8&#945;,12-lactone of 8&#946;-hydroperoxy-(13-17)-pentanorlabdan-19-oic acid (82) which was reduced to the hydroxy-lactone (83) and the keto-diacid (84). The esters (81) and (87) of compounds (83) and (84) were prepared and used as model compounds for the attempted synthesis of the fungicide LL-21271&#945;. An efficient method for generating an exocyclic methylene group at C-8 of the (13-17)-pentanorlabdane skeleton was found, and the preparation and some reactions of the epoxides of dimethyl (13-17)-pentanorlabd-8(17)-en-12,19-dioate (130) and dimethyl (13-17)-pentanorlabd-8(9)-en-12,19-dioate (133) have been investigated. Bromination of 8-oxo-(13-17)-pentanorlabdan-dioic acid esters gave unexpected 7&#945;-bromo derivatives. Methyl, hydrogen 7&#945;-bromo-8-oxo-(13-l7)-pentanorlabdan-12,l9-dioate (162) was found to undergo an unusual elimination and decarboxylation reaction to give the methylene ketone (166) which underwent dimerisation affording compound (167). Some C-19 oxygenated compounds that were expected to have ambergris-type odours were prepared and found to be odourless.

Their existence could be confirmed by astronomical observations, but until today they have not yet been measured directly. A measurement would not only confirm general relativity, but also allow for interesting astronomical observations. Great effort is currently being expended to facilitate gravitational radiation measurement, most notably through earth-bound interferometers (such as LIGO and Virgo), and the planned space-based LISA interferometer. Earth-bound interferometers have recently taken up operation, so that a detection might be made at any time, while the space-borne LISA interferometer is scheduled to be launched within the next decade.Among the most promising signals for a detection are the waves emitted by the inspiral of a binary system of stars or black holes. The observable gravitational-wave signature of such an event is determined by properties of the inspiralling system, which may in turn be inferred from theobserved data.  A Bayesian inference framework for the estimation of parameters of binary inspiral events as measured by ground- and space-based interferometers is described here. Furthermore, appropriate computational methods are developed that are necessary for its application in practice. Starting with a simplified model considering only 5 parameters and data from a single earth-bound interferometer, the model is subsequently refined by extending it to 9 parameters, measurements from several interferometers, and more accurate signal waveform approximations. A realistic joint prior density for the 9 parameters is set up. For the LISA application the model is generalised so that the noise spectrum is treated as unknown as well and can be inferred along with the signal parameters. Inference through the posterior distribution is facilitated by the implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The posterior distribution exhibits many local modes, and there is only a small "attraction region" around the global mode(s), making it hard, if not impossible, for basic MCMC algorithms to find the relevant region in parameter space. This problem is solved by introducing a parallel tempering algorithm. Closer investigation of its internal functionality yields some insight into a proper setup of this algorithm, which in turn also enables the efficient implementation for the LISA problem with its vastly enlarged parameter space. Parallel programming was used to implement this computationally expensive MCMC algorithm, so that the code can be run efficiently on a computer cluster. In this thesis, a Bayesian approach to gravitational wave astronomy is shown to be feasible and promising.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian chirp analysis</field><field name="subject">Bayesian spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">MCMC implementation</field><field name="subject">Parallel tempering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240100 Astronomical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical studies of copper and thallium</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Peter Charles Ash</field><field name="description">The anodic growth of a Cu2O film on polycrystalline copper surfaces was studied by a potentiostatic method. Plots of anodic current versus time allowed the growth law to be determined and the Cu2O film thickness was found to vary linearly with the cube root of time. The same growth law applied when Cu2O films were formed by aqueous oxygen attack at the copper surfaces. A mechanism has been proposed explaining this law, based on assumptions of Cabrera and Mott for gaseous oxidation of copper. The cyclic voltammetry technique was used to study the growth, dissolution and reduction of Cu2O and the higher copper oxides over the pH range 5.20 to 13.83. Cu2O was the first oxide formed, and depending on the pH, either CuO or Cu(OH)2 was formed over the underlying Cu2O at higher potentials. In NaOH solutions, of concentration 0.10M and greater, presence of the oxide, Cu2O3 was noted at potentials corresponding to oxygen evolution. During cathodic reduction of the films formed anodically, the Cu(II) product was initially reduced to Cu2O, followed by Cu2O reduction to Cu metal. Solid state reactions for the growth, dissolution and reduction processes are included. No explanation for peak formation during anodic film growth by the cyclic voltammetry technique can be found but plateau formation is predicted. The inclusion of chloride in the anodically formed films increased the conductivity of the oxide films greatly. A 0.100M Na2B407 solution containing 9.6 x 10-4M benzotriazole was found to inhibit the formation of films at the copper surface probably by the formation of a Cu(BTA) polymer. The presence of sodium hexametaphosphate had no effect on oxide growth kinetics at pH 9.18. Potentials of specimens of copper piping corroding in Auckland's supply water were measured against a saturated calomel electrode. The values depended largely on the conditions of water flow and stagnation. Illumination and surface preparation of the samples had little effect. The corrosion potentials reached a maximum after approximately 30 days and the high potentials observed were attributed to the resistance of the films of corrosion products covering the metal surface. A mechanism for the corrosion process has been proposed with the electrophoretic deposition of a layer of silica gel over the underlying Cu2O film causing local cell action and the formation of anodic and cathodic areas over the copper surface. The gel allows diffusion of Cu2+ into the solution from the anodic regions and OH-from the cathodic regions, forming a loosely adherent flocc of Cu(OH)2 the metal surface. This flocc is readily scoured from the surface leading to Auckland's green water problem.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fast mobility spectrometer for atmospheric ions</field><field name="creator">Brownlee, John Nevil</field><field name="description">The development of a mobility spectrometer which yields a complete spectrum every 25 seconds is described.

The spectrum function's parameters can be fitted reliably with standard deviations of 3% or better. The spectrometer was used for observations of temporal variations in the atmospheric ion mobility spectrum at Auckland. These show a clear diurnal variation, and demonstrate that the spectrum can change significantly in an interval of 100 seconds.

(Keith Richard), 1951-</field><field name="description">The heterolytic chlorination of 1-arylnaphthalene (aryl = 1(p-nitrophenyl), (p-chlorophenyl), 1-phenyl, and 1(p-methylphenyl) ) yields the appropriate 1-aryl-r-1,c-2,t-3,t-4-tetrachloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene as the major product of addition. The 1H n.m.r. spectra of these compounds show that there is no significant change in the conformation adopted in solution accompanying the change in the para-substituent. The major product of the alkaline dehydrochlorination of each of these tetrachlorides using sodium methoxide in methanol-acetone (80:20 v/v) or benzene-methanol (75:25 v/v) is the 1-aryl-2,3-dichloronaphthalene. The first stage of the reaction is rate-controlling and both stages appear to be bimolecular. The observed rate-coefficients have been dissected to derive rates for the two competing elimination processes involving either initial loss of the 4-chlorine and 3-hydrogen or of the 1-chlorine and 2-hydrogen. The value of the Hammett reaction constant for the first of these processes was found to be 0.60 in methanol-acetone and 0.85 in benzene-methanol. The corresponding values for the second process were found to be 1.48 and 1.58. Both these results indicate that the effect of substituents in stabilizing the incipient negative charge developing at the &#946; &#8211;carbon in the transition state is an important feature of the elimination processes involved. A slow, unimolecular solvolysis at the 1-chlorine has been observed with 1-Ph-NTC and 1(p-Me-Ph)NTC in methanol-acetone. It is proposed that the major product of this solvolysis results from the replacement of the 1-chlorine by a methoxy-group with retention of configuration. In contrast, the major product of solvolysis assisted by silver(I) ions is that possessing the inverted configuration. Alkaline dehydrochlorination of the methoxy-substituted compounds derived from 1(p-Me-Ph)NTC leads to fully aromatic products. This requires the elimination of the components of a molecule of methanol under comparatively mild alkaline conditions. Dehydrochlorination from the 1-arylnaphthalene tetrachlorides promoted by aluminium chloride in carbon disulphide at reflux temperature results in a mixture of the 1-aryl-2,3- and 2,4-dichloro- products. The proportion of 2,4-dichloro- product varies from 49% (1(p-NO2-Ph)NTC) to 65% (1-Ph-NTC).</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of some reactions between electrophilic halogens and various conjugated systems in which intermediates or products having rearranged double-bond systems are concerned</field><field name="creator">Hannan, Brian Neil Bernard</field><field name="description">PART I A STUDY OF MECHANISTIC VARIATIONS IN THE BROMINATION AND CHLORINATION OF SOME ALKYL PHENOLS, PHENYL ETHERS AND PNENYL ESTERS. The brominations of some 2,6-dialkylphenyl acetates in nitro-methane and in acetic acid have been shown to give (a) products of substitution at both the C-3 and C-4 nuclear sites (b) products of substitution with rearrangement leading to the formation of various brominated alkylphenols and (c) uniquely in acetic acid, a product of alkyl side-chain substitution. The bromination of the corresponding benzoate derivatives realised only the products of 3- substitution. Various products of (a) substitution and (b) substitution with rearrangement were determined in the bromination of 3,4-dimethylphenyl acetate, phenyl acetate, and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl acetate. The bromination of 2,4,6-dimethylphenyl methyl ether gave only the expected product of nuclear substitution. Evidence for the likely involvement of addition-elimination sequences in the formation of products of substitution with rearrangement, has been adduced. The possible role of various other processes leading to the formation of deacylated products is discussed. The chlorination of 2,6-dimethylphenyl acetate, 2,6-dimethylphenyl benzoate and of 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl acetate in both acetic acid and nitromethane gave only the expected product of nuclear substitution. The reaction of chlorine with 3,4-dimethylphenol, its acetate and methyl ether in acetic acid led to the formation of certain enone and dienone adduct derivatives which could be shown to rearrange under the conditions of the reaction to give (a) in the case of the phenol-products of substitution and (b) for the acetate and methyl ether derivatives, products of substitution with rearrangement. The structures of the intermediates were determined from their spectral properties. Various mechanisms likely to be involved in processes of chloro-deacylation and of chloro-demethylation are discussed; a consideration of certain structural features of the substrates studied led to the conclusion that chloro-deacylation and chloro-demethylation were essentially processes initiated by ortho- attack of the chlorine molecule. PART II REACTION PATHS IN THE BROMINATION OF CHOLEST-4-EN-3-ONE, CHOLEST-5-EN-3-ONE AND 3-ACETOXYCHOLESTA-3,5-DIENE The bromination of cholest-4-en-3-one can occur by a number of reaction paths. Conditions have been established under which reaction can be established as occurring in part by electrophilic attack on (a) 3-hydroxycholesta-4,6-diene (b) 3-hydroxycholesta-2,4-diene or its anion and (c) cholest-4-en-3-one; among the products can be included 2&#945;-, 4-, 6&#946;-, and 6&#945;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one; 2&#945;,6&#946;-, 2&#945;,6&#945;-, and 4,6&#946;-dibromocholest-4-en-3-one; and 2&#945;,4,6&#946;-tribromocholest-4-en-3-one. Unstable adducts involving the 4,5-double bond are implicated in a number of cases. The bromination of cholest-5-en-3-one is equally complicated, and can involve addition to the 5,6-double bond. Knowledge of the range of conditions and reagents through which 3-acetoxycholesta-3,5-diene is brominated to give 6&#946;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one has been extended. Intermediate adducts involving the 5,6-double bond have been shown to be components of the reaction mixture from the acetoxydiene and bromine in acetic acid. Acid catalysed isomerisation and rearrangements of the kinetically controlled products, and dibromination, can be controlled by selective choice of the conditions of bromination and work-up. Complications associated with the reaction paths have been partly elucidated. The rates and mechanism of reversible isomerisation of 6&#946;- to 6&#945;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one, and of 2&#945;,&#946;- to 2&#945;,6&#945;-dibromocholest-4-en-3-one, have been studied and a proposed mechanism is outlined.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of copper(II) with ligands containing nitrogen and sulphur donors</field><field name="creator">Braithwaite, Andrew Castley</field><field name="description">A study of the influence of several "soft donor" ligands on the cupric ion has been completed. Nitrogen and sulphur donors were chosen since these are considered to be present in "biological copper" situations, some of the conditions of which it was hoped to duplicate. Complicated reactions were found with several different types of ligands. Those containing imine functions, when complexed to copper(II), were invariably found to cleave due to the presence of external nucleophiles and it was considered that for such donors to be important in "biological" situations they would need to be shielded by bulky ligand systems. The cleavage reactions were found to have their origin in electronic mechanisms and earlier suggestions based on steric interactions were criticised. A study of sulphur donors showed that, whereas thioethers had a poor affinity for copper(II), thiols bonded very strongly. Reduction to copper(I) invariably took place, but with ligands containing TT-delocalised aromatic thiols as well as amine donors mixed-valent complexes of copper were formed. The properties of most of these complexes were unusual and one, especially, (N-(2-thiophenol) pyridine-2-aldiminato)copper(II) chloride, showed reactions and properties that suggested it may be a suitable model for cupro-enzymes. Complexes with thiol donors were termed "anomalous" in view of their complicated physical properties, whereas compounds with other donors showed "normal" behaviour. Absorption spectral studies were undertaken in an attempt to understand the electronic states of the "soft donor" complexes; at the same time an assessment of a recent scheme for assigning stereochemistries from visible spectra as applied to "soft donor" systems was possible. An X-ray structural determination of the complex &#956;-chloro-chlorobis(3,4-bis(3-amino-1-thiapropyl)toluene)dicopper(II) diperchlorate was undertaken, partly because of its unusual synthetic and physical characteristics. Two copper centres, one five- and the other six-co-ordinate, were found to be linked by a bridging chloride ion. The geometries about each copper ion were considerably distorted from square-pyramidal and octahedral respectively; the ligand systems also showed unusual electronic effects. Comparison with other recent structural investigations suggested that five-co-ordination is favoured by the copper ion in "soft donor" environments, and this was thought to be significant in terms of oxygen-carrying ability, where an increase in co-ordination number must occur. Several attempts to oxygenate prepared complexes were made, but no conclusive results were obtained, although several somewhat unstable crystalline products were produced.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorocarbene complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Hoskins, S. V.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the synthesis and properties of fluorocarbene complexes of ruthenium and osmium. Chapter 1 is a review of transition metal CF3-complexes and illustrates a number of unusual features of these compounds which makes them suitable for modification into CF2-complexes. To place the fluorocarbene complexes into context, Chapter 2 contains a brief review of transition metal carbene complexes with the emphasis on other halocarbene species. As described in Chapter 3, CF3-complexes of ruthenium can be prepared by the addition of Hg(CF3)2 to Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2. The x-ray crystal structure of Ru(HgCF3)(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 shows longer C-F bonds in the ruthenium bound CF3-group than in the mercury bound CF3-group. Reactions of fluorocarbon complexes with Lewis acids have been explored and RuCl(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with BCl3 to form the known RuCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2. Similarly OsCl(CF2H)(CO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with one equivalent of BCl3 to form initially a cationic carbene complex in which the carbene carbon atom substitutes first into a benzene ring of one PPh3-ligand and, through further reaction with BCl3, into a ring of the second PPh3-ligand. The x-ray crystal structures of OsCl(CO)2(PPh2C6H4CHCl)PPh3 and OsCl(CO)2(PPh2C6H4CH)(PPh2C6H4) are reported. RuCl(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 in many of its reactions behaves as a CF2-complex precursor and Chapter 4 describes the reaction between the related RuCl(CF3)(CH3CN)(CO)(PPh3)2 and Me3SiCl to form the first isolable CF2-complex, RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2. RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 contains an electrophilic carbene ligand and reacts rapidly with hard, oxygen and nitrogen containing nucleophiles. A comparison of the reactivity of RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 and RuCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is presented and reasons for the differing reactivities proposed. Chapter 5 shows that d8 CF2-complexes can be prepared directly from reaction between the more active CF3-transfer reagent, Cd(CF3)2-glyme, and various zerovalent complexes. The x-ray crystal structures of M(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os and OsCl(NO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 are described and the bonding characteristics of the CF2-ligand discussed. The carbene ligand of M(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os has some nucleophilic character and reacts readily with electrophiles, for example reaction with HC1 yields MCl(CF2H)(CO)2(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os. A comparison between RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 and Ru(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 reveals that the reactivity of the carbene ligand is controlled by the electron density at the metal centre, i.e. is oxidation state dependent.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Routes to drimanes from podocarpic acid</field><field name="creator">Grimsdale, Andrew Clive</field><field name="description">The synthesis and ozonolysis of the 6- and 7-substituted 12-hydroxypodocarpatrienes (26), (86), (90), and (98), as a possible route for the synthesis of drimanes from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (podocarpic acid) (9) has been investigated.

Statistical uncertainties are typically &#177; 0.01. The measurements were made with a proton polarimeter in which the left-right asymmetry of scattering at 60&#176; (lab.) in 4He is determined. The polarimeter employs "venetian-blind" collimation of the protons by conical vanes and 75 cm2 plastic scintillator detectors. Four detectors are included for use in polarization transfer experiments. For 10.5 MeV protons and a helium pressure of 250 p.s.i. the target thickness is 3 MeV and the efficiency per detector per unpolarized proton incident is 10-4. For each polarimeter detector a triple coincidence with a 15 ns resolving time was required with two scintillator transmission detectors preceding the polarimeter. Spectra of random coincidences were accumulated simultaneously and subtracted. Asymmetries resulting from polarimeter-target misalignment and other geometrical effects are discussed. All results quoted are geometric means of pairs of measurements for 180&#176; rotation of the polarimeter and are also arithmetic means of such measurements to left and right of the 3He target. The absolute analyzing power is estimated by computer simulation of trajectories to be -0.638 &#177; 0.020 for protons entering at 10.3 MeV. The product of polarization and cross section is fitted to an expansion of first-order associated Legendre polynomials using these results and earlier measurements. Only four terms are required except at 6.0MeV where a fifth is necessary. The energy dependence of these coefficients suggests resonances in 5Li at deuteron energies of 60MeV (odd coefficients) and 7.5 MeV (even coefficients) in agreement with results for the polarized-beam analyzing powers(1). Comparison of the results with vector-polarized-beam (1) and polarized-target(2) analyzing powers shows no evidence for the postulated simple relations(3) based on DWBA cal calculations. Comparison of the results with recent measurements of the neutron polarization in the mirror reaction(4) shows no significant differences. The theory of angular correlations in charged particle reactions is developed and used to calculate outgoing nucleon polarizations. Expressions are given for polarization transfer coefficients. These coefficients are evaluated in terms of the T-matrix elements for the interference of various channels with the dominant S-wave, J&#928; = 3+/2 channel in 3He(d,p)4He at the 0.43 MeV resonance.

It has been found that the yields of benzobisbenzofuranquinonoid (1) derivatives are greater when after initial nucleophilic attack on the ketoenoid system by the oxygen atom of the phenoxide ion, the carbon atom ortho to the vinyl-aryl ether linkage is activated towards further nucleophilic attack by the presence of a suitably orientated electron releasing substituent. The other products of the reaction mixture have been isolated and characterised, and the spectral data discussed for the derivatives of 2,3-diethoxydi-benzofuran-1,4-quinone which were obtained in this way. The mass spectra of benzobisbenzofuranquinones and the corresponding quinol acetates have been examined. Facile loss methyl radicals from aromatic methoxy groups and ketene from the acetate derivatives was observed. Decarbonylation and fragmentation involving the heterocyclic ring system resulted in peaks of only minor intensity. The ready loss of substituents as described above is explained by the resulting formation of resonance stabilized quinonoid ions. Some chemical constituents of Peniophora gigantea have been isolated and characterised. 2',3',6'-Trimethoxy-p-terphenyl (25) was obtained which represents the first methoxylated p-terphenyl isolated from a fungus. Also obtained was a mixture comprising two compounds, C30H48 and C30H50. On mass spectral grounds these are proposed to be the pentacyclic triterpenes, lupa-15,19(22)-diene (33) and lup-19(22)-ene (34) respectively. 14,15-Epoxy-2-ketomanoyl oxide (44) has been microbiologically hydroxylated by Calonectria decora to form 1&#946;,7&#945;-dihydroxy-14,15-epoxy-2-ketomanoyl oxide (45). The positions of the hydroxyl groups were determined from the peaks arising from fragmentations in rings A and B in the mass spectrum. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding observed in the i.r. spectrum supported the equatorial conformation of the hydroxy group at Cl whilst the facile loss of water upon electron impact and the presence of a signal corresponding to an equatorial carbinol proton in the n.m.r. infers that at C7 is axial. Finally, it has been proposed that the structures of the blue pigments, corticins A and B, isolated from Corticium caeruleum by Dean are 2,6,9-trihydroxy-3,8,12-trimethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']bisbenzofuran and 2,3,8,9-tetramethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']bisbenzofuran-6,12-dione respectively. The n.m.r. spectrum of corticin A triacetate and comparison of the mass spectra of these compounds and those authentic samples prepared synthetically support these structures.

The interpretation of the observed catalytic effects of the copper(II) ion, has been attempted in terms of ion association. The proposed scheme, for the aquation, involves metallation of the CrOX33- species to account for the promoting effect of the copper(II) ions. The specific rates of aquation and formation constants of the various species formed between the copper(II) ion and the CrOX33-  ion have been obtained using curve fitting techniques. Further, the dependence of the formation constants and the specific rates of aquation on temperature has been shown to yield realistic thermodynamic and activation parameters for the proposed model. Increasing the pH was found to have an accelerating affect on the aquation of the trisoxalatochromium(III) ion at constant copper ion concentration. This has been discussed, using ion association, in terms of catalysis of the aquation reaction by hydrolysis products of the copper(II) ion, in particular the CuOH+ ion. The catalysed and uncatalysed isomeristion of the bisoxalatochromium(III) ion has been investigated in the presence and absence of various electrolytes and the kinetic data has been rationalized in terms of an ion association model. It has also been proposed, from comparisons of studies on the copper(II) ion catalyes aquation and racemisation of the trisoxalatochromium(III) ion, that a copper(II) ion associates with the CrOX33- ion through three carboxyl oxygen atoms, one from each oxalate group to form a monometallated species. Further comparison of these studies has led us to postulate, in the aquation, that a second copper(II) ion, proposed to associate with the monometallated species, associates with two carbonyl oxygen atoms of one of the oxalate groups of the CrOX33- ion. This, and the comparison of the specific rates of aquation of the monometallated and bimetallated species, led us to the conclusion that aquation occurs by a rapid one ended dissociation of an oxalate ligand followed by a rate determining loss of the oxalate group.  A number of other results of relevance to the substitution and rearrangement reactions of chromium(III)-oxalate complexes, have also been included.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in New Zealand Late Paleogene&#8211;Early Neogene Radiolaria</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Barry M.</field><field name="description">Radiolaria from Late Eocene to Early Miocene localities in New Zealand are detailed in a series of studies in an attempt to broaden our knowledge of New Zealand Late Paleogene-Early Neogene Radiolaria, and a new technique for investigating Radiolaria is described. Chapter One introduces the studies and the rationale behind each, details the history of radiolarian work in New Zealand, and provides discussion of several points that surfaced during the studies. The points discussed are: radiolarian literature; plate production; scanning electron micrographs versus transmitted light photomicrographs; skeletal terminology; systematic paleontology and the description of new species; radiolarian classification; usefulness of strewn slides. Each study constitutes a published in press, or in review paper and is presented as a chapter. As each chapter is able to stand alone, their abstracts are given below. The reference lists for each paper/chapter have been amalgamated into a master list at the end of the thesis and so do not appear at the end of each chapter: Chapter Two - Seven New Radiolarian Species from the Oligocene of New Zealand Abstract: Seven new radiolarian species from the Oligocene Mahurangi limestone of Northland, New Zealand, are formally described.

Radiolarian faunal composition confirms a Late Eocene age for the Oamaru Diatomite. Chapter Six &#8211; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy: A New Technique for Investigating and Illustrating Fossil Radiolaria Abstract: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a technique newly applied to the study of fossil Radiolaria, offers the radiolarist clear views of single optical planes of specimens, unhindered by many of the optical effects of conventional light microscopy, while obviating the need to section or break specimens. Resulting images are of a clarity unsurpassed by conventional light microscopy and, as they are saved on computer, are easily viewed, manipulated, enhanced, measured and converted to hard copy. Used in conjunction with common radiolarian study methods CLSM is a powerful tool for gaining additional information with relatively little extra effort. Chapter Seven conveniently summarises taxonomic, stratigraphic and geographic data of all new taxa described, incorporating information gained from the studies and relevant literature.

The relative simple structure of liverworts in comparison to vascular plants implies that they have to combat environmental stress at a cellular level. Liverworts are an important part of the New Zealand flora. Leafy liverworts such as Jamesoniella colorata, Isotachis lyallii and Lepidolaena taylorii display a spectacular range in colouration within a single population. The leaves can vary from pale green in shaded habitats to bright red in more exposed places. A thalloid species, Monoclea forsteri, lacks such pigmentation but it might possess some unique cellular features to deal with stressful conditions. This thesis aims to study the cellular characteristics that allow liverworts to cope with extreme environmental conditions, with emphasis on (red) auxiliary pigments. Genetic analysis of liverwort populations revealed a highly clonal structure, which suggests that red colouration of liverwort leaves is a phenotypic response, and not a result of genotypic differences. Indeed, the red pigment could be induced in I. lyallii at relatively modest irradiance levels. The red leaves absorbed about 10% more photosynthetically active radiation than green leaves from the same species. Although the chemical characteristics of the red pigment remained elusive, it has light attenuation characteristics similar to anthocyanins in vascular plants. Its cellular location inside the cell wall is ideal for intercepting potentially damaging light quanta and can thereby protect the underlying chloroplasts from high light fluxes. The light energy that is absorbed by the red pigment did not translate into an enhanced protection from chilling-stress through leaf warming. The photosynthetic apparatus of liverworts has acclimated to the environmental conditions that these plants are most likely to experience in their habitat. Gametophytes from shady environments had lower chlorophyll a to b ratios than gametophytes found in sunnier places. This illustrates the need for a more efficient light-harvesting system in the former to collect all of the available light. In addition, plants from sunny environments had lower chlorophyll to carotenoid ratios than plants found in shady environments, which suggests that the photoprotective properties of carotenoids are better developed in the former. This was confirmed by measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence which clearly showed a greater potential for nonphotochemical quenching in gametophytes from exposed habitats than gametophytes found in sheltered places, both during high light treatment and desiccation. A better developed photo-protective system (i.e. non-photochemical processes and lightscreening pigments) allowed the red-leaved gametophytes to better deal with high light stress as well as desiccation than their green-leaved counterparts. Measurements of photosynthetic responses revealed that red gametophytes were photoinhibited less and their recovery was more complete from a high light treatment of 1800 &#956;mol/m2/s than the greens. Similarly, measurements of photosynthetic responses and oxidative damage indicated that the red morph was better protected from high light fluxes that occur during drought-stress than the green morph. Determination of cell water relations showed that the red pigment in J. colorata did not influence the water balance during drought. In conclusion, this study has presented evidence that liverworts from exposed habitats are better equipped to deal with abiotic stressors such as high light and dehydration than liverworts from more sheltered environments. Changes in pigment composition, concentration and location are likely to play an important role in liverwort protection from environmental stress &#8211; most noticeably a red pigment with photo-protective attributes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereospecific Syntheses from Podocarpic Acid</field><field name="creator">Fullerton, T.

Unimproved values for individual parcels of land are aggregated into 301 areal units and multiple regression analysis is used to explain the spatial pattern of values in 1970. Temporal variations in the pattern of unimproved values and the influence of increasing values on the distribution of agricultural land use are also explored. The study area comprise most of the territory over which the Auckland Regional Authority has jurisdiction. Both 'accessibility' and 'area-characteristics' models are used to interpret the pattern of unimproved values in 1970. In general the area-characteristics models are the most successful, but higher R2 values are achieved with hybrid models that combine road distance from the CBD modified by travel time, with such characteristics of areas as size of holding, land use, and terrain. In analysing the pattern of values in 1955, 1960, and 1365 compared with 1970, the statistical contribution of road distance to the CBD compared with terrain is stressed. Distance becomes a more effective predictor of value through time, while the explanation contributed by terrain-characteristics deteriorates. The large increases in the value of land that the region has experienced during the period studied are shown to have had less influence on the distribution of agriculture than has been suggested in other contexts. The main reasons advanced for the resilience of agriculture is its ability to compete for land, which is influenced by legislation allowing the postponement of rates (territorial local authority land taxes) on some agricultural land. The means by which quotas are allocated to farmers supplying liquid milk, and the marketing of fruit and vegetables direct to consumers, are also important in maintaining agricultural land in production.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient effects in geothermal convective systems.</field><field name="creator">Horne, Roland Nicholas</field><field name="description">This work is a detailed analysis of the transient behaviour of geothermal convective systems.

The deuteron - nucleus interaction, the simplest cluster reaction, is considered in detail within the Coupled Channels framework. The Coupled Channels formalism was chosen because it accurately handles inelastic and transfer couplings of arbitary strengths. The fact that transfer channels are orthogonal to each other only asymptotically is taken into account by reallocating the wave function in the internal region, from the deuteron channels to the transfer channels, taking components from the deuteron channels in ways exactly analogous to the way the antisymmetrisation requirements remove blocked deuteron-core components. Thus a unified treatment of the two effects is facilitated. It is found further that when all possible transfer channels are included, along with all Pauli blockings from the core nucleons, then under certain conditions at low energies, the wave function in the deuteron channel is small and oscillatory in the internal region, leaving the deuteron as a cluster to have largely asymptotic significance. In this limit, the exact non-local potential governing the deuteron channel simplifies considerably in one approximation to be replaceable by just several orthogonality conditions, and these are easily modelled in solving the coupled equations for the radial wave functions. This simplified and unified model has the advantage, since the deuteron's internal wave form is significant only asymptotically, of allowing automatically for arbitary deuteron polarisation by the core (though not vice-versa). Furthermore, the asymptotic matching is not at a fixed radius as in R-matrix theory, but is a continuous process that depends on the binding energies of the actual proton &amp; neutron bound states in the residual nucleus.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240302 Nuclear and particle physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aqueous radiation chemistry of cysteamine and some related compounds</field><field name="creator">Sims, Ritchie John</field><field name="description">The radiation chemistry of cysteamine and of cysteamine-S- phosphoric acid in oxygen-free and oxygenated solution has been studied at acidic and near-neutral pH.

From measurements of the dependence of G(-RSH), G(RSSR), and G(H2O2) upon pH and cysteamine concentration, suggestions regarding the stoichiometry of the chain reaction occurring at higher pH and the mechanistic implications have been made. The dependence of the rate of oxidation of cysteamine by hydrogen peroxide upon pH has been studied, second-order kinetics being observed over the pH range 6.5 to 10.9, and the rate has been found to depend in a simple manner upon ionisation of the thiol. The rate constant of the reaction of aquated electrons with cysteamine-S-phosphoric acid has been measured as about 5 x 109 M-1 sec-1 by competition with cysteamine at pH 4.2, and measurements have indicated the formation of orthophosphate, inorganic phosphorothioate, and an aldehyde as products of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with cysteamine-S-phosphoric acid at pH 8.6.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solvent extraction of cobalt and nickel carboxylates</field><field name="creator">Woollard, Gerald Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the solvent extraction of ternary complexes of cobalt(II) and nickel(II). In a preliminary survey, the extraction of nickel(II) by a variety of systems containing carboxylic acids in the presence of 1,2-diaminoethanes was investigated in order to determine the extent to which these complexes extract into different solvents. The aromatic carboxylic acids studied were benzoic, p-toluic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, anthranilic and salicylic acid while the aliphatic acids studied were butanoic, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, dodecanoic, 2-bromohexanoic, 2-brom&#246;octanoic, chloroacetic and 2-chloropropanoic acid. The 1,2-diaminoethane used in conjunction with these acids were ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, N,N'-diaminoethylenediamine, N,N-diaminoethylenediamine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine. Of the aromatic ternary systems studied, salicylic acid with either 1,2-diaminocyclohexane or a N-substituted diamine were found to give the highest extraction. These were then investigated in depth to determine the number and nature of the extracted species. Unlike the aromatic acids, the longer chain n-carboxylic acids are capable of quantitative extraction in the absence of a diamine. During the course of this part of the project it therefore became necessary to investigate the extraction of nickel(II) both by the acids alone and by the acids in combination with a diamine. It was found that the inclusion of a diamine had little influence on the pH of extraction. Finally, the extraction of cobalt(II) by combination of salicylic acid and N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine and by decanoic acid alone were investigated. The behaviour of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) in equivalent systems were compared in order to assess the degree of separation obtainable.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrosyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Laing, Kerry Richard</field><field name="description">This study concerns the synthesis, structure and reactivity of nitrosyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium.

The labile halide ligand is readily displaced by a large range of anions and it is believed that both linear and bent nitrosyl linkages may exist for different members of this series. The structures of these complexes are discussed in the light of recent X-ray crystal structure data. Halogens and hydrogen halides add to give the familiar RuX3(NO)(PPh3)2; RuCl3(NO)(PPh2Me)2 is prepared in a direct reaction and also by phosphine exchange and 1H n.m.r. data confirm that the phosphine ligands are trans. The complexes RuX(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 react readily with O2 to form the dioxygen complexes Ru(O2)X(NO)(PPh3)2. Halogens and hydrogen halides produce RuX3(NO)(PPh3)2. The dioxygen complexes react with SO2 and N2O4 to give sulphato and dinitrato complexes respectively. The reaction with CO results in the intramolecular oxidation of the nitrosyl group to coordinated nitrate accompanied by the incorporation of two moles of CO, i.e. RuX(NO3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 is formed. The dioxygen complexes catalytically oxidise triphenylphosphine or triphenylarsine to the respective oxides and RuX(NO)(PPh3)2 can be isolated from this cycle. Reactions of these four-coordinated complexes with O2, CO, Cl2 and NOBF4 are recorded. The dinitrosyl complex Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 is reported from a number of syntheses, the most successful being via a ligand reaction when RuCl2(CO)2(PPh3)2 is heated with NaNO2 and Ph3P in dimethyl formamide. The P-tolyldiphenylphosphine analogue is also reported and the mono-substituted product Ru(NO)2(PPh3)[P(OPh)3] is produced in an exchange reaction between Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 and excess triphenylphosphite. This phosphite complex reacts with Ph3P and O2 to produce Ru(O2)(NO2)(NO)PPh3)2 by an atom transfer process. Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with the acids HY (Y = BF4, PF6, ClO4) and O2 to give the dinitrosyl cations [Ru(OH)(NO)2(PPh3)2]+Y- in which the two nitrosyl groups are structurally and electronically inequivalent. [RuCl(NO)2(PPh3)2]BF4 is reported and reactions of these dinitrosyl cations with halide ions to give RuX2(NO3)(NO)(PPh3)2, with intramolecular oxidation of the NO group, are also described. OsCl2(OH)(NO)(PPh3)2 reacts irreversibly with alcohols to form OsCl2(OR)(NO)(PPh3)2 (R = CH3, C2H5, n-C3H7, (CH3O)CH2CH2) which readily undergo hydride abstraction to form OsHCl2(NO)(PPh3)2. Sodium borohydride converts this complex to the trihydrido species OsH3(NO)(PPh3)2 and if the reaction is performed in the presence of Ph3P, OsH(NO)(PPh3)3 results. The coordinated perchlorate complex OsHCl(OClO3)(NO)(PPh3)2 results form the reaction of OsHCl2(NO)(PPh3)2 with silver perchlorate; this is readily reversed by chloride ions or the solvents CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. This perchlorato complex also arises from the reaction of OsH(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 with HClO4 and a related tetrafluoroborato complex, OsH(OC2H5)(FBF3)(NO)(PPh3)2 by substituting HBF4. This complex reacts with Ph3P to give [OsH(OH)(NO)(PPh3)3]BF4, CO to give [Os(CO)2(NO)(PPh3)2]BF4 and LiX (X = Br, I) to give OsHX2(NO)(PPh3)2. OsHCl(OClO3)(NO)(PPh3)2 reacts with NaOH in methanol, in the presence of O2 to produce Os(O2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. This dioxygen complex is far less stable than the ruthenium analogue but it undergoes similar reactions. Ph3P is oxidised, SO2 and CO give sulphato and a nitratodicarbonyl complex respectively. Infra-red, 1H n.m.r., conductivity, molecular weight data and elemental analysis have been used in formulation and structural assignment.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry::250603 Reaction kinetics and dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the reactivities of co-ordinated malonate, oxalate and carbonate</field><field name="creator">Rands, David Barrett</field><field name="description">The acid catalysed aquation of potassium trismalonatochromium(III) and potassium bismalonatodiaquochromium(III) have been studied. Almost linear plots of log kobs against the Hammett acidity function were interpreted as being due to an A-1 mechanism operating. Two kinetically different types of co-ordinated oxygen were found in a study of the oxygen exchange between the trisoxalatocobalt(III) anion and 0-18 enriched water. The carbonyl, or outer, oxygen atoms are thought to exchange by an A-2 bimolecular mechanism, while the carboxyl, or inner, oxygen atoms are thought to exchange indirectly by co-ordination of enriched oxalate groups to the cobalt centre during the anation reaction of the bisoxalatodiaquocobalt(III) ion. Finally, oxygen exchange reactions between 0-18 enriched water and various carbonato-ammine cobalt(III) complexes were studied, and it was found that generally the three oxygen atoms of the co-ordinated carbonate exchanged at equal rates, an exception being in the case of the carbonatobis(o-phenanthroline)Co(III) ion where the outer, carbonyl, oxygen exchanged faster than the inner, metal-bound, oxygen atoms. The first of these two groups has been interpreted in terms of a fast, reversible one ended dissociation process occurring, which is much faster than oxygen exchange, and the latter case in terms of a rate determining one ended dissociation step.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scattering Effects in Long Distance Radio Propagation</field><field name="creator">Bannister, Richard Ward, 1941-</field><field name="description">It is well known that the ionosphere is not a uniform and homogeneous medium.

The effect of these ionospheric disturbances on conventional high-frequency radio communication links is an important study, and extends back to almost the beginning of ionospheric investigations.

Amidines, allyl and cyclopropenyl cations are easily reached by these reactions. The 1,1,3,3-tetra-aminoallyl cations of this series can be reversibly protonated at C(2) to give diamidinium ions. Action of KOH on the diamidinium species CH2[C(NHBut)2]2 2+ produces the diamidine CH2[C(NBut)(NHBut)]2 which hydrolyses to the formamidine CH(NBut)(NHBut). Bis- and tris-amino substituted Cyclopropenylium ions are formed by the action of secondary amines on pentachlorocyclopropane. The cations of this study are stabilised by electron back-donation from nitrogen atoms of substituent groups- The subject of back-bonding was probed in several ways. crystallographically determined structures of representative salts afforded bond length data from which deductions about back-bonding were made. The measurement of barriers to bond rotation is another way that this effect was investigated. Using the technique of variable temperatue NMR, VT-NMR, spectroscopy, energies of activation about unsaturated bonds of allyl, amidinium and cyclopropenylium cations were found. UV-spectra provided additional information concerning bonding in these species. Tautomerism of N,N&#8217;-disubstituted amidines was investigated by VT-NMR spectroscopy. Individual tautomers were identified in NMR spectra (13C,1H). Tris-alkylaminocyclopropenylium ions were oxidised to form intensely coloured radical dications. The first Raman spectrum of a cyclopropenyl radical dication was determined. Using the technique of pulse radiolysis we were able to reduce the cyclopropenylium cation, [C3(Net2)3]+, to the molecular radical. Further, pulse experiments enabled standard reduction potentials of representative [C3(NR2)3]2+ and allyl radical dications to be measured and compared. In general, tertiary amines reacted with pentachlorocyclopropane to generate product mixtures. Reaction of para-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP, on pentachlorocyclopropane was a case in exception. The novel allylide product is the same as that formed via an alternative route. The direct reaction of ammonia on pentachlorocyclopropane product several products including the formamidine NC-N=CH-NH2. A polyamide was prepared from the hydrolysis of a diamidinium ion. The mechanism of formation and the characterisation of this glossy, thermoplastic material is discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallographic studies of nitrosyl, isocyanide and dithiolate complexes of Group VIII metals</field><field name="creator">Whittle, Kenneth Rodney</field><field name="description">The present interest in organometallic nitrosyl complexes stems partly from their similarity with carbonyl analogues which are widely used as catalysts in industrial processes. The search for potential new catalysts among nitrosyl complexes is perhaps not surprising when it is realised that the nitrosonium ion (NO+), the species normally regarded as being co-ordinated, is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide. Further interest may be due to the fact that NO+ is also isoelectronic with molecular nitrogen and hence nitrosyl complexes may be suitable as models for co-ordinated nitrogen in the process of nitrogen fixation. In their own right nitrosyl complexes pose problems of chemical interest concerned with their structure and the bonding associated with the metal-nitrosyl bond. As part of an investigation into the geometry of co-ordinated nitrosyl this thesis presents structural data for several nitrosyl complexes of Group VIII metals .. In addition the mode of binding of the isocyanide group has been studied as well as the associated stereochemistry of the metals ruthenium, osmium and iridium. To date, structural studies have established three different modes of co-ordination for the nitrosyl group. Probably the most common involves a linear arrangement of metal, nitrogen and oxygen, the effective coordinating species being regarded as the diamagnetic nitrosonium ion (NO+).</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Te Kuiti group in Waitomo County, South Auckland</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Campbell S. (Campbell Symes)</field><field name="description">The Oligocene Te Kuiti Group in Waitomo County, North Island, New Zealand, is divided into two subgroups, six formations and seven limestone members; six of the members are new. The stratigraphic definition, distribution, thickness, lithology and contacts of major rock units, and the three dimensional relationships between them, are described and figured in detail. Rapid lateral and vertical lithologic variation in strata is accomodated by recognition of 31 lithofacies. Te Kuiti sediments, which include mainly bioclastic lutites, bioclastic arenites and biocalcarenites, were deposited in sublittoral waters, from a few to about 100 metres depth, as seas transgressed south over a topoqraphically subdued, but locally varied landscape cut in Mesozoic lutites and arenites. Distribution of major paleotectonic elements indicates the gross sedimentary environment was one of a north-facing, partly enclosed basin with a prominent north-trending median basement ridge (Piopio High) in the south. Deposition continued until this ridge was almost completely buried, at which time the Te Kuiti embayment expanded rapidly and linked with more southerly basins. The contact with the overlying Mahoenui Group is generally conformable in Waitomo County. Formations and members are commonly bounded by unconformities, mainly disconformities, some of which preserve features consistent with their interpretation as submarine hardgrounds. The unconformities record periods of erosion or non-deposition during major downward shifts in base level controlled partly by eustatic sea level changes. Comprehensive paleontological charts are prepared for each formation and age relationships established. Macrofossils are generally scarce, and dominated by thick-shelled, epifaunal bivalves. Foraminifera are more abundant and are mainly benthonic forms. Formations may straddle New Zealand stage boundaries and, within Waitomo County, are not strongly diachronous. Primary sedimentary structures in arenites and calcarenites include mainly thinly bedded wavy-, lenticular-, and cross-stratification formed by the spreading and interfering of sand sheets, sand ribbons and sand waves across extensive areas of flat shallow sea floor, possibly under the influence of tidal currents. Lutites and muddy arenites are massive and bioturbated. A new classification for mixed terrigenous-allochemical rocks is proposed and an X-ray technique developed for modal analyses of lutites. The petrography of individual lithofacies is described and illustrated in detail and summarised on pie diagrams. Variations in the kind, quantity, size, sorting and abrasion of bioclasts, in the king and quantity of matrix add/or cement, and in the content of glauconite and terrigenous sand and mud serve to distinguish the various lithofacies. Bioclasts are derived principally from bryozoans, echinoids and benthonic foraminifers and, to a lesser extent, from coralline algae, planktonic foraminifers, molluscs and brachiopods. Siliciclasts include mainly quartz, oligoclase &#8211; andesine plagioclase, potash feldspar, montmorillonitic clays and glauconite. Quartz and feldspar were detritally inherited from Mesozoic basement rocks; montmorillonite formed from the marine diagenetic transformation of vermiculite and degraded chlorite and illite derived from Oligocene soils; glauconite developed from mont-morillonitic clays under specific environmental conditions. Complete chemical analyses of seven glauconite concentrates are presented and compared with published analyses. The principal non-opaque heavy minerals in the group are zircon, epidote and apatite. Sediment pores are infilled with granular and rim ortho-sparite cement, or by a variety of matrix materials, including micrite, calcilutite and lutite. Petrologs display the vertical variation in petrographic properties through the group and, in conjunction with grain size analyses of insoluble residues, are used to interpret the energy level of the environment of deposition of individual rock units. Te Kuiti sediments accumulated under a spectrum of environmental energy conditions, ranging from quiet to strongly agitated waters. The primary Te Kuiti sediment was dominated by metastable magnesium calcite and, less abundant, aragonite skeletons. These skeletons underwent syndiagenetic stablisation reactions at, or close below, the sea floor. Large quantities of skeletal aragonite were dissolved from the sediment before lithification. Aragonite was preserved only where anaerobic conditions were maintained in the sediment. Stabilisation of magnesium calcite grains involved the texturally non-destructive process of incongruent dissolution, which yielded a replacement product of calcite. Sources of CaCO3 for cement included (a) solution of aragonite grains, (b) intergranular solution of bioclasts and, most important, (c) pervasive solution of bioclasts, under shallow burial loads, at those levels in the sediment relatively enrichment in siliciclastic, and especially muddy, material. Dissolved CaCO3 was precipitated as calcite cement in adjacent or nearby sediment layers. A paragenetic sequence of diagenetic events is established for the group. Finally, Oligocene paleogeography and paleoclimate are outlined and a synthesis of the environment of formation and depositional history of sediments of the Te Kuiti Group in Waitomo Country is established.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260111 Other stratigraphy (incl. sequence stratigraphy)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The middle Jurassic of New Zealand : a study of the lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Ururoan, Temaikan and Lower Heterian Stages (?Pliensbachian to ?Kimmeridgian)</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Neville</field><field name="description">The lithologic and biostratigraphic successions of Ururoan, Temaikan and Lower - Middle Heterian (?Sinemurian, Pliensbachian - ?Kimmeridgian) strata from southwest Auckland, south Otago and Southland, New Zealand, are described and discussed. A more logical correlation of the lithologic sequence at Port Waikato with that at Te Akau is proposed. Two new formations are introduced for the sequences on the western limb of the Kawhia Regional Syncline, the Whakapatiki Mudstone for the fine grained lower Kirikiri Group strata in the Awakino Valley and the Gribbon Formation for the Rengarenga Group strata between Marokopa and Mahoenui. In Southland a new formation (Ben Bolt Formation) is proposed for the c.1340m sequence overlying the Flag Hill Sandstone, in turn overlain by a 485m thick, mudstone-dominated formation for which a long disused name is resurrected (Lora Formation). The Lora Formation is in turn overlain by a coarse-grained unit, for which the name West Peak Formation is proposed. In the absence of suitable alternatives, a subdivision of the Ururoan Stage into a Lower Ururoan, the range-zone of pseudaucella marshalli, and an Upper Ururoan, the interval-zone between the last appearance of Pseudaucella marshalli and the first appearance of a Temaikan fauna is proposed. The existing three-fold subdivision of the Temaikan Stage is emended. Belemnopsis mackayi and B. deborahae are retained as the indices of the Temaikan and its lowest subdivision, as they are present in most sections at a consistent stratigraphic position. Retroceramus (Fractoceramus) inconditus is proposed as the basal Middle Temaikan index species. Retroceramus(R.) brownei, which first appears consistently higher than R. inconditus, but below R. marwicki is proposed as the index for the upper Middle Temaikan. Retroceramus (R.) marwicki is proposed as a replacement upper Temaikan index for "Macrocephalites cf. beta-gamma" which is unsuitable. Meleagrinella n. sp. is inconsistent in its first appearance and therefore unsuitable as a Middle Temaikan index and, although confined to this stage, it ranges from Early to early Upper Temaikan. Basal Temaikan Belemnopsis spp. are absent from sections in the Catlins district whereas the earliest Temaikan taxon appearing above typical Ururoan faunas is Meleagrinella n. sp. In the absence of a better alternative Meleagrinella n. sp. is used to mark the base of the stage in the Catlins sections. However, the base of the Temaikan is here likely to be slightly younger than in other sections. Within the redefined Upper Temaikan four subdivisions based on the sequence of Retroceramus species are recognised. The lowest of these is characterised by the first appearance of R. (R.) marwicki, the second by the first appearance of R. (R.) n. sp. A., the third characterised by the first appearance of R. (R.) stehni, and the highest marked by the first appearance of either R. (R ) sp. C. (a wide triangular form) or sp. D. (an ovate flat form). The presence of these two morphologic forms indicate finer zonation of the Upper Temaikan may be possible, with further field work. The Ururoan to Middle Heterian succession of New Zealand is correlated with the international chronostratigraphic scheme based mainly on comparison of New Zealand's Retroceramus succession with that of South America and Indonesia and on relatively rare ammonites. The Ururoan is equivalent to the ?Sinemurian to Late Toarcian, Temaikan to the ?latest Toarcian to Early Callovian and the Early Heterian to the Middle Callovian to latest Middle to Late Oxfordian. Early Ururoan is correlated with the ?Sinemurian to Pliensbachian based on the presence of the ammonite Juraphyllites. Presence of the Early Toarican ammonites Harpoceras cf. falcifer and Dactylioceras spp. in the Late Ururoan indicates a potential international correlation of ?Late Pliensbachian to Late Toarcian. A ?late Toarcian to Aalenian correlation for the Early Temaikan is suggested by the presence of the European belemnite Brevibelus zieteni. Retroceramus (Fractoceramus) inconditus is similar to the Northern hemisphere Mytiloceramus lucifer and the northern hemisphere Retroceramus gr. popovi and thus suggests a latest Aalenian to Early Bajocian correlation of the Middle Temaikan. The earliest Late Middle Temaikan Retroceramus (Retroceramus) marwicki is also present in the Late Bajocian (Rotundum Zone) of Argentina. ?Teloceras gr. banksi, ?stephanoceras (S.) gr. humphriesianum, Chondroceras (C.) gr. evolvescens, C. (C.) cf. recticostatum, and C. (Defonticeras) cf. oblatum are present in the Middle Temaikan reinforcing an earliest to late Early Bajocian correlation for this substage. Toxamblyites aff. densicostatus Sturani, Chondroceras (C.) gr. Evolvescens (Waagen), C. (Schmidtoceras) orbignyanum (Wright), C. (Defonticeras?) sp. indet. occur with Retroceramus marwicki indicating an Early to Late Bajocian correlation for this zone, slightly broader than in Argentina. However, somewhat anomalously the first of these ammonites suggests a Mid Aalenian to Early Bajocian correlation. The succeeding zone (Retroceramus (R.) n. sp A. zone) has yielded the Latest Bathonian Xenocephalites grantmackiei and Lilloettia aff. boesei. Retroceramus(R.)stehni is the index for the third Upper Temaikan Retroceramus zone and is also known from the latest Bathonian to Early Callovian of Argentina. In New Zealand R. stehni is associated with Lilloettia cf. Lilloetensis and Xenocephalites cf. stipanicici which also indicate a latest Bathonian to Early Callovian correlation. The fourth and highest zone of the Upper Temaikan has yielded the ammonites Araucanites marwicki, Eurycephalites gr. extremus, Iniskinites gr. cepoides and Choffatia (Homoeoplanulites) sp. suggesting an Early to Middle Callovian correlation. The overseas relationships of the associated Retroceramus (R.) spp. C. and D. are unknown. The Heterian index Retroceramus (Retroceramus) galoi is of Oxfordian age in Indonesia where it is associated with Malayomaorica malayomaorica. In New Zealand Araucanites marwicki and Sulaites heteriense are present in the Early Heterian, below the incoming of Malayomaorica malayomaorica, low in the range of Retroceramus galoi. The presence of Sulaites high in the Early Heterian suggests a ?Middle to Late Oxfordian correlation while Araucanites indicates the lowest part of the range of Retroceramus galoi could be slightly older, perhaps Upper Callovian. The biostratigraphic scheme presented here is a significant advance on those proposed previously.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activation of tritium gas by irradiated silica gel and consequent exchange reactions with organic substrates</field><field name="creator">Matthews, K. Murray (Kenneth Murray)</field><field name="description">The reactions between tritium gas and organic substrates sorbed on irradiated silica gel have been studied. It has been found that tritium gas, when admitted to gamma-irradiated silica gel, is adsorbed on radiation-induced sites on the solid and bleaches the blue colour of the solid. The sorbed tritium becomes activated to at least two forms; one capable of exchange with alkanes such as 2 methylbutane and both capable of exchange with toluene and 2 chloro2methylbutane. High levels of tritium were incorporated into 2 methylbutane, 2 chloro2methylbutane and toluene, up to 32&#177;2%, 95% and 100% of the total tritium present, respectively, being incorporated (using 2 g SiO2, irradiated 15h), with high standards of radiochemical purity, (97&#177;1% for 2 methylbutane). Yields of labelled hydrocarbons were found to be sensitive to the conditions under which the silica gel was degassed before irradiation; optimum degassing conditions being evacuation for one hour at 973 K. Yields were also found to be dependent on the quantities of silica gel and tritium used and on the radiation dose given the silica gel, all three of these being increased concurrently for maxim yields to be obtained. In a study of the labelling of hydrocarbons of different structures it was found that alkanes containing a tertiary carbon atom were labeled heavily compared to straight-chain hydrocarbons; activity yields of the substrate hydrocarbon decreasing with increasing molecular size, to insignificant values with hydrocarbons heavier than 2 methylhexane. Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as hex-1-ene were found to undergo hydrogenation on irradiated silica gel to produce labelled alkanes; branched-chain alkenes undergoing double-bond isomerization. Reaction mechanisms for tritium activation and exchange have been proposed, involving ionization of tritium by radiation-induced positive holes in the solid and exchange of the ionic species with carbonium ion intermediates. It has also been established that gamma-irradiated alkali halides do not promote exchange of tritium gas with alkanes.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyperbolic Geometry and Reflection Groups</field><field name="creator">Marshall, T.

The cases k=l, n+1 give, respectively a pair of hyperboloids, and the ordinary n-sphere. In the first chapter we consider the pseudospheres as surfaces h En+1,k, where Em,k=Rk x (iR)m-k, and investigate their geometry in terms of the linear algebra of these spaces. The main objects of investigation are finite sequences of hyperplanes in a pseudosphere. To each such sequence we associate a square symmetric matrix, the Gram matrix, which gives information about angle and incidence properties of the hyperplanes. We find when a given matrix is the Gram matrix of some sequence of hyperplanes, and when a sequence is determined up to isometry by its Gram matrix. We also consider subspaces of pseudospheres and projections onto them. This leads to an n-dimensional cosine rule for spherical and hyperbolic simplices. In the second chapter we derive integral formulae for the volume of an n-dimensional spherical or hyperbolic simplex, both in terms of its dihedral angles and its edge lengths. For the regular simplex with common edge length &#947; we then derive power series for the volume, both in u = sin&#947;/2, and in &#947; itself, and discuss some of the properties of the coefficients. In obtaining these series we encounter an interesting family of entire functions, Rn(p) (n a nonnegative integer and p&#949;C). We derive a functional equation relating Rn(p) and Rn-1(p). Finally we classify, up to isometry, all tetrahedra with one or more vertices truncated, for which the dihedral angles along the edges formed by the truncatons. are all &#960;/2, and the remaining dihedral angles are all sub-multiples of &#960;. We show how to find the volumes of these polyhedra, and find presentations and small generating sets for the orientation-preserving subgroups of their reflection groups. For particular families of these groups, we find low index torsion free subgroups, and construct associated manifolds and manifolds with boundary In particular, we find a sequence of manifolds with totally geodesic boundary of genus, g&#8805;2, which we conjecture to be of least volume among such manifolds.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote sensing techniques for geothermal investigation and monitoring in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mongillo, M. A. (Mike A.), 1949-</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of remote sensing techniques for the investigation and monitoring of geothermal areas in the Taupo volcanic zone of New Zealand. The research and development of a helicopter-borne video thermal infrared scanner technique and associated computer image processing methods constitutes the major portion of this study. In addition, preliminary results are presented from a related shallow ground temperature study conducted to investigate diurnal, seasonal and meteorological effects on temperatures in active thermal ground and results from a precursory assessment of SPOT-l satellite multispectral imagery obtained over the Waiotapu Geothermal Field for detecting, identifying and mapping characteristic geothermal surface features are also reported. The initial conduct of two video thermal IR scanner test surveys, one using an Inframetrics 525 over portions of the Rotorua Geothermal Field, the other using a FLIR 1000A over portions of the Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Field, demonstrated that imagery useful for basic geothermal feature mapping could be obtained in the late summer to early autumn period. Surveying during the hours around dusk was shown to be appropriate. Experimentation established instrument operating settings and defined nominal survey parameters. The real-time video imagery format proved useful as an aid to navigation and as a check on proper instrument set-up and operation- The helicopter platform provided valuable manoeuvrability and control. The results obtained from these two initial surveys aided development of survey design and conduct methodology. The video imagery obtained with both the Inframetrics and FLIR scanners was compatible with New Zealand's PAL standard- Visual TV-VCR inspection of the IR imagery allowed easy identification of a range of natural thermal features. Identification of cultural features aided location of the thermal anomalies. The Inframetrics imagery suffered from serious banding and other minor problems. The FLIR imagery was of a generally higher quality, though it exhibited problems. The fundamental ability to digitize images from the videotapes and apply powerful computer image processing techniques to aid interpretation and analysis was demonstrated. A methodology for pre-processing and enhancing the digitized Inframetrics and FLIR images was developed. Application of these image processing techniques brought out detail unavailable in the grey-level imagery and greatly increased interpretation ability. The demonstrated success of the first two test surveys led to the conduct of the first known large-scale video thermal IR scanner surveys of geothermal fields. Most details of the first of these ate confidential (at the client's request). A complete range of geothermal features was detected and easily recognised and their distribution established thus providing a much more detailed map of the geothermal activity than was previously available. The successful results attained confirmed the survey design and conduct methodology used. The second and largest survey covered the entire Rotorua Geothermal Field (l8 km2). Imagery was obtained with both the Inframetrics and FLIR IR scanners and a visible wavelength video camera. Extensive ground control measurements were made. This comprehensive survey of geothermal activity established a baseline from which change can be monitored The survey identified large scale seepage and submerged thermal input into Lake Rotorua which may be the source of known missing chloride. The first geothermal surface feature changes were identified, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the method for monitoring change. Preliminary image temperature calibration results were obtained and a procedure for constructing visible wavelength-thermal IR composite images was developed. The positive results demonstrated by this survey have led to the helicopter-borne video thermal IR technique being adopted for major geothermal feature mapping and monitoring programmes in New Zealand. Preliminary assessment of the high spatial resolution (20m) SPOT-1 multispectral imagery of the Waiotapu Geothermal Field. showed that the larger geothermal surface features can be detected and identified on a contrast stretched, 3-band colour composite image. A shallow (&#8804; 1m depth) ground temperature measurement site was established in an area extending from very active to near ambient conditions. Preliminary results show that temperature variations ranging from l-19 &#176;C can occur in the most active ground. These temperature variations exhibit a strong negative correlation with atmospheric prcss111e changes and can introduce large, unexpected inaccuracies in ground temperature measurements.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iodine azide addition to alkenes</field><field name="creator">Smith-Palmer, Truis</field><field name="description">Various systems for the formation of iodo-azide derivatives of alkenes have been examined. Iodine(I) azide, formed from sodium azide-iodine(I) chloride, has been found to exist in acetonitrile as a complex with sodium azide. The addition of iodine(I) azide to 5&#945;-androst-2-ene in both dichloromethane and acetonitrile has been examined in detail, as well as the addition of thallium(I) azide-iodine in dichloromethane to the same substrate. Products were identified as those arising by diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions, or by cis-addition to the &#945;-face of the alkene. Addition of iodine(I) azide in dichloromethane to 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene gave a cis-adduct as the major product, in addition to trans-diaxial adducts and a trans-diequatorial adduct. Formation of the products was rationalised as arising from c-3 carbocations or from trans-diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions. The major product from the reaction in acetonitrile was one of ring contraction. No cis product was formed in this reaction but an elimination product was present. Products from the latter reaction were postulated as arising from trans-diequatorial or trans-diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions. The reaction of sodium azide-iodine-crown ether with 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene in chloroform gave a high yield of the same product as those obtained in the reaction with iodine(I) azide in acetonitrile. The reaction of thallium(I) azide-iodine in dichloromethane with the above alkene gave products which could have all arisen via a c-3 carbocation. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azides of 5&#945;-androst-2-ene with silver(I) acetate in acetic acid occurred with retention of configuration showing that azide acted as a neighbouring group in the reaction. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azide(94) of 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene gave, inter alia, a product where azide migration had occurred. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azide(95) gave mainly products of elimination. The action of iodine(I) azide on 3-methylene-5&#945;-androstane and 1-mewthylene-4-tert-butylcyclohexane was examined and found to be non-regio- and non-stereo-specific. Iodo-azides were also formed from 3-tert-butylcyclohexene and 3-methoxycyclohexene. In each reaction the major product was that of trans-diaxial opening of the cis-iodonium ion, while the second major product arose by trans-diequatorial opening of the trans-iodonium ion. The ratio of diaxial to diequatorial product varied with the iodo-azide-producing system being used, and was larger in the case of 3-methoxy-cyclohexene, especially when the solvent was dichloromethane. A mechanism was postulated which involves reversible formation of iodonium ions as the fast step followed by rate-limiting attack by azide ions. Solvolysis of these iodo-azides was also investigated. Prior to the current work, both an AdE2 and an Ad3 mechanism had been postulated for the addition of iodine(I) azide to alkenes and in an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities a kinetic study was initiated. Preliminary results indicate that the reaction with cyclohexene is electrophilic and second order.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Cancer Chemotherapy</field><field name="creator">Dean, Ian Christopher</field><field name="description">The role of metals in biological processes has been discussed with particular emphasis on the importance of chelation. Furst has suggested that many anticancer drugs may owe their activity to their chelating properties. A number of new amidoximes and hydroxylamine have been made from the appropriate imidoyl chloride and a hydroxylaqine. The spectral and chelating properties of these compounds are discussed. All the compounds have been submitted to the anticancer screening programme of the National Cancer Institute. The results available so far are presented and indicate that the compounds are toxic but inactive against experimental tumours. Sodium sulphide reduces a-phenyl-o-nitro-cinnamonitrile (106) to 2-amino-3-phenylquinoline-1-oxide (107) in good yield. Extension of the reduction to other o-nitrocinnamonitriles gives very poor results. The spectral properties, configurations and conformations of the o-nitrocinnamonitriles are discussed. The 12-aminoquinoline-1-oxide group is shown to form solid metal complexes. That from 2-amino-3-phenylquinoline-1-oxide (107) with nickel has been prepared.

The first quantitative description of the extraction process was, however, not made until 1941 when Kolthoff and Sandell compared experimental data with theoretical predictions for the extraction of metal dithizonates. They found that the theory they proposed was valid under wide experimental conditions. However, the systems used by Kolthoff and Sandell were simple ones and hence relatively simple theory was used to successfully explain their behaviour. In practice solvent extraction systems are complicated by other factors, e.g. hydrolysis, polymerisation and complex formation in the aqueous phase. It has subsequently become apparent that such factors have an important influence on the solvent extraction of chelates. Several authors have published reports since 1941 on the theory of solvent extraction of metal chelates which take these factors into account. In particular two publications by Irving, Rossotti and Williams and Stary (chapter 3) should be noted for their comprehensive treatment of the subject. The influence of these factors will be discussed in the following sections.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250200 Inorganic Chemistry::250202 Main group metal chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the chemistry of titanium dioxide in fused salt solvents</field><field name="creator">Udy, David John</field><field name="description">An investigation into the chemistry of solutions of titanium dioxide in fused alkali metal borates has been made, with the emphasis on the ability of the alkali borate melts to dissolve TiO2 and subsequently crystallize TiO2 and/or complex alkali metal titanates. The preparation and properties of potassium titanates with K2O/TiO2 mol ratio &#8804;1 has been studied. In addition the thermal decomposition of potassium hexafluorotitanate monohydrate (reported to yield potassium tetratitanate) has been investigated. The decomposition product has been identified as an oxyfluorotitanate. The compounds crystallized on slow cooling of alkali borate + TiO2 melts have been identified. The titanium containing product(s) have been correlated with the concentration of borate groups containing non-bridging oxygens, which depends on the alkali metal cation. Phase diagrams for the M2O.B2O3 + TiO2 (M = Na, K) systems have been obtained. Mass transport in M2O.2B2O3 + TiO2 (M = Li, Na, K) systems has been studied, via measurements of electrical conductivity, as a function of temperature and TiO2 concentration. Additional information on the alkali borate melts has been obtained from measurements of the optical basicity of M2O + B2O3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) glasses, using Pb(II) as probe ion. The results of these measurements have confirmed that the nature of the alkali metal cation significantly affects the basicity of fused alkali borate solvents. Extraction of TiO2 from ilmenite and titaniferous slag, using selected low-basicity alkali borate solvents has been attempted. The results indicate that TiO2 may be separated from ilmenite in essentially a one-step process.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250200 Inorganic Chemistry::250202 Main group metal chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies in reduction and rearrangement</field><field name="creator">Rewcastle, Gordon William</field><field name="description">PART ONE SYNTHESIS AND ACID-CATALYSED REARRANGEMENT OF CYCLOPROPANE-1,2-DIOLS A number of cyclopropane-1,2-diyl diacetates have been synthesized by the anhydrous Clemmensen reduction [Zn(Hg)-HCl-organic solvent] of &#946;-diketones and &#946;-ketoaldehydes, and this reaction was found to be a general one for those substrates that did not exist mainly in the enol form. Cyclopropanediol formation does occur with some highly enolized compounds under aqueous conditions but, with the anhydrous system, enol acetate formation or enolic reduction was found to compete with reduction of the diketo form. Acid-catalysed rearrangement of the free diols generally gave &#945;-hydroxy-ketones, or their corresponding &#945;&#946;-unsaturated enones, with &#946;-hydroxy-ketone formation only being observed with one substrate. A strong preference for methyl ketone formation was observed in all cases and this phenomenon was rationalized by consideration of the apparent relative thermodynamic stabilities of the &#945;-ketol conjugate acids. PART TWO AROMATIZATION OF 2&#945;-HYDROXY[4-13C]CHOLEST-4-EN-3-ONE The aromatization of 2&#945;-hydroxy[4-13C]cholest-4-en-3-one has been found to occur with migration of the labelled carbon to C-10, thereby lending support to previous mechanistic proposals. The aromatization of [4-13C]cholesta-1,4-dien-3-one similarly gave a product with the label at C-10, in agreement with earlier work involving carbon-14 labelling studies. The ease with which these rearrangements could be studied is in marked contrast to earlier work, and the combination of carbon-13 labelling and 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy offers many advantages over the degradative techniques required with carbon-14 labelling. PART THREE CLEMMENSEN REDUCTION OF (5R)-5-HYDROXYHEXAN-2-ONE Previous work in this department suggested that the Clemmensen reduction of &#947;-substituted ketones involved an intramolecular displacement of the &#947;-substituent by the carbonyl oxygen atom. However, the reduction of (5R)-5-hydroxyhexan-2-one had given a mixture of hexan-2-ol and cis- and trans-hex-4-en-2-ol, with no inversion of stereochemistry occurring with the saturated isomer. The opposite signs of rotation for the two geometrically isomeric alkenols suggested the possibility of different chiralities, but this was disproved when the 2R-configuration was determined for each alcohol by analysis of the 1H n.m.r. spectra of the esters with (-)-(S)-&#945;-methoxy-&#945;-trifluoromethyl-phenylacetic acid. This result thus invalidates the earlier hypothesis.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ring C Transformations of Podocarpic Acid</field><field name="creator">Missen, Alan William</field><field name="description">This thesis describes Further studies on the utilisation of the diterpenoid natural product , 12-hydrxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trim 19-oic acid* (podocarpic acid) (1) . In particular it describes transformations of the C-ring to give suitable intermediates for the synthesis of optically active steroids and terpenoids. An investigation has been carried out on the Birch reduction of 12-methoxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-ol (8), and conditions for the optimum formation of the ketonic products (10) and (12) are suggested. The enones (25) and (26) have been synthesised from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (1) by sequences involving reduction of the aromatic ring followed by ring C transformations. Methyl 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oate (3) has been converted in ca. 60% yield to the dextrorotatory C 13 methyl ether which has then been reduced in good yield to the enone (163). Potential routes for conversion of the enones (25), (26), and (163)into steroidal analogues are described. Initial steps in the transformation of the C 13 methyl ether(62) into an intermediate (176) suitable for the synthesis of (+)-a-onocerin (80) have been investigated.

Through the study of geometrical and optical isomers Werner and later workers deduced the importance of specifio stereochemical arrangements in these molecules and their nature has been a subject of enquiry ever since. Not only has it been repeatedly found that the lighter transition metals exhibit tetrahedral, planar and octahedral stereochemistry but it has also become clear that certain metals prefer a specific arrangement and will not normally adopt another - leading to the set of generalisations which maintain for example that "nickel is never tetrahedral." The application of physical techniques and the growth of quantum chemistry allowed a more rigorous view of these observations and led to the valence bond theory of Pauling. This theory, particularly when later modified by Taube, laid great emphasis on covalent bonding between metal and ligand and consequently on the highly directional nature of the atomic orbitals involved. These were the hybridised orbitals of the metal which in the particular combinations sp3, dsp2 and d2sp3 accounted for the generally observed tetrahedral, planar and octahedral stereochemistry of complexes. Tne theory furthermore provided an explanation for many of the magnetic properties of these compounds and, in a general way, for their reactivity so that a strong impression grew that the stereochemistry of any complex was simply a function of the orbital hybridisation of its central metal atom.</field><field name="date">1964</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the ribonucleic acids of subcellular fractions</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Peter.

It has become increasingly apparent to biochemists that a mixture of enzymes, substrates and products in a single phase could hardly carry out the many reaction sequences that must be involved in the metabolic transformations conducted by the cell.  Thus attention has been increasingly directed to the study of the discrete units of the cell with respect to chemical constitution and biological function.  The pioneering studies of Bensley and Hoerr (1934) and Claude (1946) on cellular fractionalism have led to what is now a powerful approach to the study of living cells - smashing them and studying the pieces.  The first objective of cellular fractionation is to find out what reactions take place and what compounds occur in the various isolated systems.  A second objective is to reassemble the pieces and relate their activities in various combinations to the activities of the whole cell.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of students&#8217; understanding and representation of derivative in a graphic calculator-mediated teaching and learning environment</field><field name="creator">Delos Santos, Alan Gil Gutierrez</field><field name="description">This research is a collective case study that investigates the constitutive relationship between students' representational competences and mathematical understanding of derivative. Its goal was to describe the representational abilities characterising different ways of knowing, and these were categorised as procedure-oriented, process-oriented, object-oriented, concept-oriented and versatile. The study was conducted in four Form 7 classrooms, in their Mathematics with Calculus classes, where graphic calculators were used in the teaching and learning of derivative. The choice of the context was based on the belief that the use of graphic calculators might encourage a multi-representational approach to teaching, and support the development of students' multi-representational way of thinking. The research data were collected both from teachers and their students. These data comprise teacher and student interviews, with the first interviews conducted before their lessons on derivative and the second after the lesson. The students were also given pre-lesson and post-lesson tests in order to triangulate student data. A Representational Framework of Knowing Derivative was constructed as an analysis tool, and used to explore students' representational abilities and ways of knowing. From the analysis, the students' cognitive processes were construed, together with the nature of their representational, cognitive and conceptual schemas. The representational framework of knowing was later refined to present an empirically-based theoretical framework that bridges the gap between what was theorised and what was observed. The results of the study suggest that the relationship between students' ways of knowing and their representational abilities is mediated by the following factors: (i) the students' interpretation of the mathematical notion; (ii) the representational nature of their interpretations of derivative, and the representational aspects in their problem solving activities; and (iii) the nature of the representational links that they have formed between procedures, processes, objects and sub-concepts that were construed to constitute their conceptual and cognitive schemas of derivative. With regard to the use of the graphic calculator, this research has noted a possible contribution of the graphic calculator in the development of students' multi-representational ways of thinking and learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The radiolysis of aqueous solutions of cysteine</field><field name="creator">Winchester, Robert Victor</field><field name="description">The radiolysis of cysteine in both deaerated and oxygenated solution at pH 7 has been studied.

It addresses the establishment of bivalve assemblages, stratigraphic subdivision and correlation, analysis of sedimentary environments, sea-level change and paleogeography in light of the tectonic framework and geological evolution of the Xizang Plateau. The Plateau consists of three terranes: Qangtang, Gangdise and Himalaya They are separated by the sutures: Kunlun-Hoh Xil-Jingsha Jiang, Banggong Co-Nu Jiang, and Yarlu Zangbo Jiang, which represent three closed oceans: Paleo-Tethys, Neo-Tethys and South Xizang Sea. Stratigraphic development of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of southern Xizang is especially closely related to the evolution of the South Xizang Sea Bivalves are one of the most common and important Jurassic and Early Cretaceous fossil groups in the Plateau. From 15 measured sections, 51 bivalve species within 26 genera are described, including 3 new genera and 14 new species.

In addition, the Oxytoma jiabulensis bed and two Meleagrinella beds are also recognised. These assemblages can be seen to be of two types, high and low diversity, indicating different sedimentary environments. These assemblages along with co-existing ammonites also provide a good basis for stratigraphic division and correlation of the sequences. Special attention is given to nomenclatural and other problems associated with the important genus Buchia:. Australobuchia Zakharov is believed to be inseparable generically, and some Xizang species of Buchia an placed in synonymy. On this basis the evolution and migration of the genus is discussed From measured sections in southern Xizang, a comparatively complete Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous sequence has been established, which includes six formations: (in ascending order) Pupugar. Nieniexiongla. Lanongla. Menbu. Xuomo and Gucocun Formations. A new stratigraphic unit, the Gangdong Formation, is established, for Mid-Upper Jurassic strata of the Gamba district. Direct and indirect biostratigraphic correlation within China and between southern Xizang and other places around Gondwanaland is well established. Lithologic features, sedimentary structures and bivalve assemblages allow four environments including nine lithofacies to be recognised in southern Xizang: 1. Inner shelf environment 1] Shoreface sandstone facies 2] Neritic terrigenous clastic facies 3] Open shelf carbonate facies 4] Protected barrier carbonate facies 5] Reef limestone facie 2. Outer shelf environment 6] Siltstone-shale-carbonate facies 3. Slope environment 7] Fine clastic facies 8] Pelagic limestone facies 4. Bathyal environment 9] Dark Buchia-ammonite-lutite facies They can be seen to be organised into sedimentary cycles, which clearly show a huge transgression with three peaks in the Upper Jurassic reaching a maximum at the top of the Jurassic (Upper Tithonian). In the Lower and Middle Jurassic, sea-level changes fluctuated between coastal and shelf-sea environments, whereas in the Upper Jurassic, as a result of sea-floor spreading in the South Xizang Sea and the formation of fault basins, the area descended into bathyal depths. Paleogeographically, the northern part of the Plateau (i.e. the Northern Branch, or Neo-Tethys) underwent a shallowing process along with areal extension during Jurassic times, but shrank in the Early Cretaceous, whereas in the Southern Branch, during Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times, the South Xizang Sea developed a wide variety of sedimentary environments, including inner and outer shelf sea, continental slope and bathyal fault basin.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of some potentially cytotoxic steroids and an investigation of canthium coprosmoides</field><field name="creator">Orgias, Eric Frank</field><field name="description">Some cyclohexyl substituted hydroxypyrimidines and pyrazoles and an aminopyrimidine have been prepared from intermediates formed by modifications of methyl cyclohexyl ketone.

The older pluton is a complex body exhibiting textural variability, cumulate-style crystallisation, varied enclaves (indicating complex magma chamber processes including convection and crystallisation along steeply-dipping northwest oriented fronts) and a multi-phase structural and dyke intrusion history. Modal analysis shows this body to be diorite to quartz monzodiorite, and geochemically calc-alkaline and medium-K in nature. In contrast the younger pluton is extremely homogeneous and intruded by a single, volumetrically sparse, dyke phase. Modally quartz monzonite to granite (adamellite), and high-K calc- alkaline, this body has higher Si, K-group + Na, REE group and HFSE group elements than the older pluton. Mineral differences are confined to An contents in plagioclase, En values in orthopyroxenes and a wider range of Al in younger pluton hornblendes. Igneous differentiation can be modelled within the older pluton and between the older and younger bodies, by fractional crystallisation dominated by plagioclase, with subordinate ortho- and clino- pyroxene and oxide phases. The dykes show a compositional range from basaltic andesite to dacite, with andesite volumetrically dominant. A temporal trend can be seen with younger dykes becoming more felsic and of greater volume, and changing orientation from northeast to northwest. Two subdivisions can be made based on the presence or absence of hornblende. Pyroxene only dykes are mostly medium-K and dominantly andesitic, whereas hornblende-bearing lithologies are both medium-K and high-K, are andesite and dacite, and appear to be more evolved chemically. The rock envelope into which the Karikari Plutonics was intruded consists of Cretaceousage basalts, rhyolites and sedimentary lithologies. Although a regular contact aureole is not exposed, the lowest grade of contact metamorphism is delineated by the first occurrence of biotite. Rocks equivalent to the hornblende hornfels facies are widespread and rare pyroxene hornfels are found adjacent to contacts. Alteration and veining, particularly prevalent in fault/shear zones, and the presence of a magmatic-hydrothermal type breccia are evidence for a hydrothermal system associated with the waning stages of Lower Miocene-age igneous activity on the Karikari Peninsula. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope data indicates the presence of fluids of both magmatic and meteoric origin. The Karikari Plutonics are correlated with the arc-type regional association of Northland and the Coromandel Peninsula. The source of these rocks is broadly M-type, hydrous and involving subduction zone, and modified mantle wedge components, but with some unspecified crustal involvement indicated by Sr isotopes. Specifically this source is modelled, for the Karikari Plutonics, as having LREE enriched 2x relative to HREE and partially melting (&lt; 15% of the source) at the base of the crust (&#8805;30 km). These melts gave rise to the arc-type association either erupting at the surface, or ponding in upper crustal (&#8804;10 km) magma chambers.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260105 Petroleum geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of dichloro- and tetrachloro- adducts of naphthalene and some of its substituted derivatives</field><field name="creator">Burton, Graham William</field><field name="description">trans-1,2-Dichloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene has been obtained as the major product of the photochlorination of naphthalene at low temperature, and is the first authentically described naphthalene dichloride. Its further reaction with chlorine, under heterolytic conditions gives, in part, a new naphthalene tetrachloride, whose configuration has been assigned, by 1H n.m.r., as being that of the r-1,c-2,c-3,t-4-isomer. The assigned configuration and conformation of the compound are confirmed by its behaviour on alkaline dehydrochlorination, which gives mainly trans-1,2,4-trichloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene as an intermediate. The naphthalene dichloride, and its 4-chloro-derivative, have been found to undergo solvolysis in methanol - acetone (4:1), and it is further found that heterolysis of the carbon-chlorine bond at C- 2 is strongly favoured, leading largely to the 1-chloro-substituted elimination product. The former dichloride also gives a small amount of 1-methoxynaphthalene, which is possibly derived by unimolecular substitution at the 1-position. The presence of a chlorine atom at the 3-position of the structure is found to inhibit the solvolytic reaction. Bimolecular syn-elimination in these compounds is accelerated by the presence of additional chlorine substituents, and the increasing preference shown for attack at H- 2, which is further accentuated by the use of the powerfully basic reagent, potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol-dimethylsulphoxide (1:4), is interpreted as indicating a transition state tending toward the E1cB- like side of the E2 spectrum of transition states. The naphthalene tetrachlorides, and some derivatives, have been found to undergo aluminium trichloride-catalysed epimerization at the benzylic centres, which yields information on the relative thermodynamic stabilities of isomers with identical relative configurations at C- 2 and C- 3, and can also be of synthetic value. The photochlorination of 1-chloronaphthalene in CC14 at room temperature proceeds analogously with the reaction of naphthalene under the same conditions, giving five new tetrachlorides, four of which have been thoroughly characterized. The presence, in some tetrachlorides, of inter-ring non-bonded compressions between adjacent chlorines has been found to cause significant changes in the geometry of the alicylic ring, causing a tendency for the half-boat conformation to be adopted, provided this does not lead to 1,4-diaxially related chlorines. The strain present in these compounds is manifested by their very marked tendency to undergo isomerization in the presence of aluminium trichloride, and greatly increased rates of alkaline dehydrochlorination. The chlorination of l,5-dichloronaphthalene in chloroform, or dichloromethane, has been studied and has been found to be markedly catalysed by traces of iodine. The products are almost wholly derived by addition of chlorine in the first stage, and this has been interpreted as arising from a steric inhibition of proton-loss by the adjacent peri-chlorine.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scattering of polarized neutrons from light nuclei</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Ross.</field><field name="description">Introduction: In this chapter the present status of our understanding of the interaction of five and fewer nucleons will be briefly summarized.

In speaking of this, the simplest problem in nuclear physics, M.L. Goldberger made the following remarks at the 1960 Midwest Conference on Theoretical Physics: "There are few problems in modern theoretical physics which have attracted more attention than that of trying to determine the fundamental interaction between two nucleons. It is also true that scarcely ever has the world of physics owed so little to so many .. . . . . .

First-order rate constants and activation parameters were determined for the rearrangement of eleven N-halogenoamides. The structures of the N-halogenoamides (RCO.NHX) differed in the leaving group (X = chlorine or bromine) and the migrating group (R=ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, diphenylmethyl, benzyl, phenyl or p-tolyl). N-Bromoamides and the corresponding N-chloroamides rearranged at similar rates. When the leaving group was changed from bromide to chloride the activation energy was reduced by about one kcal. mole-1 and the activation entropy was reduced by about three cal. deg.-1 mole-1. Differences in the reactivity of halides as leaving groups from carbon and nitrogen are discussed. Changes in the structure of alkyl migrating groups resulted in small irregular changes in the activation parameters. The kinetic data were consistent with a stepwise rearrangement mechanism in which halide departed from nitrogen in the rate-determining step to give a short-lived nitrene intermediate which subsequently rearranged to an isocyanate. Other aspects of the Hofmann rearrangement were investigated. In the Hofmann reaction of amides and hypobromite, N-bromination of the amide was found to be much faster than the rearrangement of the intermediate N-bromoamide conjugate base. In contrast, when amides and hypochlorite reacted in alkaline solution N-chlorination was not fast by comparison with the rearrangement of the intermediate N-chloroamide conjugate base. Oxygen, iodide, and hypobromite did not inhibit the Hofmann rearrangement. Rearrangement of N-brmoacetamide N-bromopropionamide, N-bromoisobutyramide and N-bromopivalamide in the presence of oxygen gave traces of nitrite as a by-product. Nitrite may result from the capture of an intermediate nitrene by oxygen. Ionisation constants of six N-bromoamides and one N-chloroamide were measured. Of the N-halogenoemides which were investigated, the most acidic was N-chloroperfluorobutyramide (pK 2.45) and the least acidic was N-bromopropionamide (pK 7.95). There are no ionisation constants of N-halogenomides recorded in the chemical literature. Part II, The Rearrangement of N-Bromo-&#945;-halogenamides and N-Bromoperhalogenoamides. Previous investigators of the rearrangement concluded that the conjugate base of the N-halogenoamide rearranged intramolecularly via a cyclic four-membered transition state to give an alkyl halide and cyanate ion. This mechanism is incompatible with evidence presented in this thesis. The arrangements of N-bromoperfluorobutyramide and N-bromo-&#945;-chloroisobutyramide in alkaline solution were not first-order reactions. In neutral aqueous solution, the N-halogenoamide conjugate bases did not rearrange. However, in the presence of an excess of hydroxide ion, the N-halogenoamide rearranged readily. The rearrangement was catalysed by hydroxide ion and ammonia and inhibited by many reagents including oxygen, hypobromite, iodide, cupric hydroxide, silver oxide, and amides of carboxylic and sulphonic acids. Possible rearrangement mechanisms are discussed. The effects of small proportions of the inhibitors showed that the rearrangement was a chain reaction. Two probable steps in the chain reaction are the addition of hydroxide ion to the N-halogenoamide conjugate base to give a dianionic intermediate and heterolysis of the nitrogen-bromine bond in this intermediate to give a nitrene. Part III, The Reaction of Mandelamide and Hypohalite. In alkaline solution, mandelamide and hypohalite yield benzaldehyde, cyanate and halide. Several mechanisms which were postulated by previous investigators are excluded by evidence presented in this thesis. Evidence for an N-chloromandelamide intermediate in the reaction of mandelamide and hypochlorite was obtained. Chlorination of mandelamide in neutral or acidic solution gave N-chloromandelamide and N,N-dichloromandelmide. In alkaline solution, the N-chloromandelamides decomposed to give benzaldehyde and cyanate. This reaction was much faster than the reaction of mandelamide and hypochlorite to give the same products. The reactions of hypobromite and hypoiodite with mandelamide were also investigated. Neither oxygen nor an excess of hypobromite inhibited the reaction of mandelamide and hypobromite to give benzaldehyde and cyanate. Hypoiodite (prepared from the reaction of hypochlorite and iodide) and mandelamide also gave benzaldehyde and cyanate in high yield. The mechanism most consistent with the evidence involves the rearrangement of an intermediate N-halogeno-&#945;-hydroxyamide conjugate base to an &#945;-hydroxyalkyl isocyanate which subsequently decomposes to benzaldehyde and cyanate. Mechanisms involving dianionic intermediates were disproved. Stoichiometric similarities in the rearrangements of N-bromo-&#945;-halogenoamides and N-halogeno-&#945;-hydroxyamides were shown to be fortuitous and not the result of similarities in the rearrangement mechanisms. Part IV, Preparation of Amides, N-Bromoamides, and N-Chloroamides. Preparations of amides and N-halogenoamides used in this thesis are described. Some of the N-halogenoamides have not been reported previously. Methods for preparing N-bromo-perhalogenoamides which are described in the chemical literature involve the bromination of the silver salt of the perhalogenoamides in trifluoroacetic acid solution. A much simpler method for preparing N-halogenoperhalogenoamides is described in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanism of halate-halide reactions</field><field name="creator">Barton, Allan F.

The general linear formulation of methods, first proposed by J. C. Butcher, is introduced, together with the definition of order for this class of methods. Finally in this chapter, the problem of stiffness and its effect on numerical procedures is considered. Following a review of Butcher's algebraic approach to the theory of Runge-Kutta and general linear methods in Chapter 2, the theory is applied in Chapter 3 to the search for general linear methods of various orders. As in the case of Runge-Kutta methods, the use of so-called simplifying assumptions plays a significant role in the practical determination of general linear methods. From amongst the range of possible numbers of simplifying assumptions, two cases are chosen and investigated in detail. The important question of stability is considered in the final section of Chapter 3. When a general linear method is used to approximate the solution of an initial value problem, special procedures are required to start and finish the integration. Whilst a major part of Chapter 4 is devoted to the determination of these procedures, the problems of the estimation of local truncation error and the implementation of general linear methods are also discussed.

The flow field model is two-dimensional and can include multiple wells, background flow and a high permeability fracture of finite length or a barrier of finite length - likely features of a reservoir in fractured rock. The flow field is represented by a complex potential. This enables the accurate calculation of the time for tracer to travel along the streamline linking the release position and the observation well. The shape of the concentration curve measured at the observation well is governed by dispersion. Two types of dispersion are considered &#8211; small scale dispersion and large scale dispersion. Small scale dispersion is due to interaction with the rock matrix and to small scale variations in velocity (not included in the flow field model), in the neighbourhood of a streamline. Large scale dispersion is due to the spread of tracer over streamlines which have different travel times to the observation well and may go to different observation wells. In the literature, small scale dispersion models are used to match the concentration curves for individual wells. Here it is shown that models with differing small scale mechanisms give equally good matches to Wairakei data and that response curves for small scale dispersion and large scale dispersion are similar. This means that the shape of a concentration response curve gives little information about reservoir structure. The important results from a tracer test are whether tracer is detected at each observation well and the travel times to the wells that respond, in conjunction with the locations of the release and production wells. This new approach to analysing tracer tests is used together with the flow field model to deduce the permeability structure and flow field of a simple hypothetical reservoir and of the Wairakei (New Zealand) geothermal reservoir.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Quaternary palynological investigations into the history of vegetation and climate in northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Newnham, Rewi M. (Rewi Munro)</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the vegetation and climatic changes over the past 20,000 years from pollen records at eight northern New Zealand lowland peat and lake sites, ranging from Taranaki to the Far North. The sites investigated are Umutekai Swamp (Taranaki), Lakes Rotomanuka, Rotokauri, and Okoroire (Waikato), Kopouatai Bog (Hauraki Plains), Lake Waiatarua (Auckland), Otakairangi Swamp (mid-Northland), and Trig Road Swamp (Far North). At sites from Auckland southwards, dating and correlation of the pollen records were enhanced by the occurrence of multiple tephra layers within the pollen-bearing sediments. The clearest picture of regional vegetation history and tightest chronologic control were obtained from the tephra-rich organic lake sediments of the Waikato lowlands. Holocene vegetation changes were broadly consistent throughout this northern New Zealand region and indicate climates, which were initially moist, mild and equable, but became increasingly variable and probably drier overall during the late Holocene. Podocarpangiosperm forest was always prominent and Agathis australis forest expanded throughout the region north of latitude 38&#176; S during the last 6,000 years. Kauri was especially prominent in the Waikato region during the 1000 years or so following the Taupo eruption of c.1800 years ago. At pollen sites from Waikato, Hauraki Plains, and Auckland, palynological evidence suggests that people began clearing forests as early as 800 years ago, but probably not much earlier. Pollen records for the last glacial show less regional uniformity. South of Auckland, scattered tracts of Nothofagus or Libocedrus forest within a shrubland/grassland mosaic were succeeded, between c.14.5 and 10 ka by the regional expansion of podocarp-angiosperm forest, with Prumnopitys taxifolia initially prominent. North of Auckland, the pre-Holocene vegetation history is complicated by uncertain chronologies. Conifer-angiosperm forest with prominent A. austalis grew in the Far North during the last glacial, while in mid-Northland, a substantial period of Nothofagus forest, shrub and grassland communities may correspond to either the entire last glacial or to the late glacial. Local variations in vegetation cover were maintained to some extent independently of regional climate, influenced by site specific factors including edaphic controls, hydroseral succession, and local hydrological changes caused by, e.g., lahar or lava flow, fluvial activity and sea level change. The influence of these local factors is most evident for the late glacial, during which period podocarp-angiosperm forest spread throughout northern New Zealand generally, but with considerable variation in timing even between nearby sites. Fire appears to have been an important factor in vegetation change throughout the period investigated, not just during the human deforestation era; peat swamp communities show a long history of association with fire, while in dryland vegetation, Agathis australis appears to have been especially affected by burning. No unequivocal evidence was found for postglacial latitudinal migrations, but several plants show significant altitudinal range expansions during the last glacial compared with their present distributions in northern New Zealand, viz., Nothofagus menziesii, Libocedrus bidwillii, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, and Halocarpus spp. Thus although vegetation communities at each locality have changed substantially over time, the flora of northern New Zealand remained essentially the same during the c.20,000 years before the human era. Interpretation of the pollen records was assisted by principal components analysis (PCA) and by referring to modern pollen data and pollen-vegetation comparisons obtained from Waipoua Forest, Northland. PCA provides an efficient means of summarising and portraying large pollen datasets, and helps to clarify underlying environmental factors and temporal trends. PCA also generally supports pollen diagram zonations determined by eye. The Waipoua study indicated that the relationship between pollen and tree abundances is highly variable within forests, dependent largely on local site characteristics, especially the masking effect of strong local pollen sources. Nevertheless, quantified pollen-vegetation relationships averaged for the study area mostly accord with results from previous New Zealand modern pollen rain studies, while adding new information for the pollen representation of several prominent northern species. The Waipoua study indicates that pollen spectra rich in Agathis may be found where trees grow nearby, but Agathis pollen appears to be less widely dispersed than pollen of other New Zealand anemophilous taxa. At several swamp sites, correlation of tephra layers and pollen-stratigraphic events reveals problems with radiocarbon chronologies which can not be satisfactorily resolved except by assuming contamination by modern carbon. Sites with a history of hydroseral succession, where swamp communities have developed in former lake basins, are especially prone to this contamination, presumably because root penetration of older sediments provides channels for downward movement of younger carbon. In such situations it may be unwise to date and correlate pre-Holocene sediments on the basis of radiocarbon alone. Periods of hiatus are not uncommon in lake and swamp profiles from northern New Zealand and it is possible that the record of the last glacial is missing or strongly compressed at many Northland sites. Sedimentation rates also varied markedly between and within sequences, precluding the accurate estimation of pollen accumulation rates except at the Waikato lake sites where tephra sequences provide detailed chronological resolution. Even here, however, pollen concentration and accumulation rates appear to have been highly susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the sedimentation regime.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sandstone architecture and development of the Tunanui slope basin-fill, Hikurangi forearc, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Timbrell, Grenville</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An interdisciplinary approach to the prediction of pit lake water quality, Martha Mine pit lake, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Castendyk, Devin N.</field><field name="description">Lakes resulting from open pit mining may be potential water resources or potential environmental problems, depending on their water quality. As the global abundance of pit mines and pit lakes increases, there is increasing pressure on the mining industry to create pit lakes that have environmental, social, and/or economical utility. This thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach involving mineralogy, physical limnology, and geochemistry to predict and improve the water quality of a proposed pit lake at the Martha gold mine, New Zealand. A mineral quantification method developed for this study measured the distributions and concentrations of wall rock minerals, and identified 8 relatively homogeneous wall rock regions, called mineral associations. Acid-base accounting using calcite and pyrite quantities identified 3 associations with acid-generating potential. Three physical limnology tools (relative depth, wedderburn number, and numerical modeling with DYRESM), predicted that the upper 2/3 of the lake will circulate annually during the winter turnover period, whereas the lower 1/3 will remain permanently isolated. Permanent stratification resulted from density differences between groundwater and river water inputs during lake filling, plus lake morphology. The geochemical model used the distribution of mineral associations to characterize the composition of pit wall runoff, and used the limnologic prediction to define the mixing frequency, mixing depth, and layer volumes. Initial modeling with the geochemical program PHREEQC indicated the lake will have a pH of 5, and Cu and Zn concentrations that exceed aquatic life protection guidelines. Sensitivity analyses showed that subaqueous water-rock reactions did not have a significant affect on lake pH, suggesting these reactions are less important geochemical factors in pyrite-bearing pit lakes. Surface adsorption onto ferrihydrite reduced concentrations of As, Pb, and Cu, suggesting these reactions are important geochemical factors in pit lakes. By covering the acid-generating mineral associations, lake pH increased above 6.5, allowing for future recreational use. Concentrations of Cu complied with aquatic life protection guidelines, however, Zn concentrations remained above these guidelines. This study demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary pit lake predictions in the design of closure plans for open pit mines. Such studies improve the ability of mining companies to sustainably develop mineral resources.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology and tephrostratigraphy of Quaternary coverbed sequences of the Auckland area, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sandiford, Anna</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of detailed palynological and tephrostratigraphic investigations of five sites around the Auckland Isthmus, which collectively contain a fragmented record spanning approximately the last 1.2 million years. A range of additional methods were applied including, radiometric dating, palaeomagnetism, identification of other palynomorphs and fossil wood, and calculation of deposition rates. Study of two late Quaternary sites provided information on the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) environment of the Auckland Isthmus. This suggested LGM forest was spatially restricted, dominated by beech forest with minor podocarp elements and contained within extensive shruband grassland. Late Quaternary sites were more easily studied than early to mid Quaternary sites because the depositional environment in which they were found provided greater palynological and tephrostratigraphic detail. Detailed published late Quaternary tephrostratigraphy also allowed for tight chronological control, accurate interpolation of ages of uncorrelated tephra and assessment of the accuracy of radiocarbon dates. Forty late Quaternary tephra layers were identified, adding to the record of eruptions sourced from the Auckland Volcanic Field, Taupo Volcanic Zone and Taranaki Volcano. Since c. 24 ka the frequency of Late quaternary tephraforming events of significant volume to be recorded in the sediments on the Auckland Isthmus is 1 every 600 years. Study of early to mid Quaternary sites was hampered by lack of published tephrostratigraphic records for correlation. Last appearance data for four extinct taxa were tentatively extended. Significant depositional hiatuses were noted; the period between c. 1.0 Ma and c. 44 ka was particularly unsatisfactorily recorded. Three key tephra markers and nine previously undocumented tephra layers were documented. Spatial variation and alternating vegetation structure characterised cooler and warmer environments of the early to mid quaternary record. Extensive high diversity conifer-angiosperm forest occurred during warmer periods while reduced diversity beech-dominated forest contained within extensive shrub/grassland characterised the cooler periods. Certain combinations of taxa occurred during glacial/stadial and interglacial/interstadial periods and an attempt was made to generalise these. It was apparent the extremes of the LGM were not reached during this time, and-that climate oscillated between cool and warm periods sometimes characterised by vegetation assemblages without modem analogue. Extensive depositional hiatuses at one site, deposition of extremely thick, reworked, homogenous marine silt at a second site, and dipping bedding planes at a third site suggest sea level variation and/or tectonism were influential in the Quaternary depositional history of the Auckland Isthmus. However, not enough evidence was present to quantify this.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemical examination of the active hydrothermal system at Ngawha, Northland, New Zealand: hydrochemical model, element distribution and geological setting</field><field name="creator">Cox, M.E.(Malcolm E.)</field><field name="description">The Ngawha geothermal system is the only known high temperature (220-230&#730;C) system in New Zealand outside the Taupo Volcanic Zone. This current examination integrates new and available geochemical and geological data on the system and surroundings. Ngawha occurs in a Quaternary-Holocene basalt field, within a ENE-trending extensional fault block 15 km in width. The youngest volcanism in the region is associated with this structure. The basaltic activity changed in composition from earlier (? 1.5 to 0.5 m.y.) high-Al, to younger alkali basalt (&lt; 0.5 m.y. to at least 1200 yr b.p.). Crystal fractionation of the alkali basalt magma produced comenditic rhyolite lava, which outcrops as a dome near Ngawha, and is also inferred to have formed an unerupted intrusion, the likely heat source. The geothermal system has developed within pre-existing fault/fracture permeability in basement metasediments (Permian-Jurassic greywacke and argillite), and is concluded to be on the order of 10,000-20,000 years old. The hydrological model developed for the system is of a fault-bounded reservoir within basement rocks, formed of a series of blocks within which fluid migrates in fractures and joints. The reservoir has a low permeability base from silica deposition, and fluid is confined by a caprock of 500-700 m of Cretaceous-Tertiary marine sediments. This allows only vapour discharge at the surface, and minor local leakage of reservoir waters. Recharge to the system is indicated to occur from the N-NE, with subsurface discharge from the reservoir to the SW. Recharging waters are heated during deep circulation (? 3.5 km) and enter the reservoir from faults to the N and on the southern boundary. Vertical displacement of up to 100 m occurs on some of these faults. Most of the 15 wells drilled (usually 1000-1200 m deep) are within the reservoir. The reservoir fluids are slightly acid pH (5.6 at 230&#730;C) alkali C1 type, but contain high B (800 mg/kg) and NH3 (200 mg/kg). They have a high gas content, largely CO2 (1.2 wt %) and H2S (100 mg/kg). These fluids have ascended in boundary faults, "degassing" during ascent, with the greatest vapour separation in the upper part of the reservoir. The residual fluids then enter the reservoir. Most dissolved constituents are probably derived from high temperature (? 350&#186;C) leaching of metasediments at depth below the reservoir. Some, however, also have a magmatic component (CO2, S(H2S), N2(NH3), Hg). The fluids have elevated &#1073;18O values (+ 5.5 &#8240;) relative to local meteoric water (-5.5&#8240;), but reservoir rocks have only been depleted c. 1&#8240;. It is concluded the high &#1073;18O is derived from rock leaching at depth, a magmatic component and boiling enrichment during fluid ascent. Reassessment of the hydrothermal mineralogy and oxygen isotopes in quartz, show that the system previously contained 260&#186;-280&#186;C fluids. Tectonic (fault) movement resulted in an inflow of cooler groundwater from the E "flooding" part of the reservoir and reducing temperatures to c. 180&#186;C. continued inflow of hot water from the N and S, and heat in rocks, has reheated the reservoir to the current measured temperatures (c. 230&#186;C). The onset of the cool inflow was probably only several thousands of years ago, and it has persisted and produced a zone of fluid mixing across the central part of the reservoir. This inflow can be identified by oxygen and carbon isotopes (in quartz and calcite), fluid chemistry, alteration minerals, and major and trace element chemistry of rocks, as well as downhole temperatures. Temperature inversions have resulted in some parts. The distribution of major, and twenty-six trace elements, was examined in cores and cuttings from twelve geothermal wells, and compared to equivalent non-geothermal lithologies. Distribution was also related to temperature, permeability and mineralogy. Most major elements have been added to reservoir rocks, but there is obvious depletion of K and Al. Of trace elements, Ba, Rb and Th are strongly depleted. Most trace elements typically show trends of major elements with which they are associated, usually by ionic substitution (e.g. Ca-Sr; K-Rb). Zn, for example, is strongly associated with Fe-and Mg-bearing alteration minerals. Some elements can be correlated with temperature, such as increasing Li, Cd, S, Ca, La and Mg. Base metals are typically enriched 30-50% relative to non-geothermal samples. Element associations, are however, often hard to determine due to the limited distribution of alteration (very low water/rock ratios), the occurrence of elements in different mineral phases, and the episodic deposition of hydrothermal minerals. The basement rocks (Waipapa Group) are of quartzo-felds-pathic nature, but have a minor volcanic contribution. Ratios of immobile trace elements (La/V vs Y) appear to be useful in distinguishing whether geothermal samples are greywacke or argillite. Sulphur fugacities of Ngawha fluids are low and S-bearing minerals are not abundant. Sulphide minerals are of limited occurrence, pyrite being the main sulphide (&lt; 5% of rocks) with minor amounts of poorly crystalline pyrrhotite. Both are more common in the upper reservoir-lower caprock, a zone in which boiling occurs. Pyrite is often of earlier (hotter) formation, and pyrrhotite of the recent-current regime. Pyrrhotite is typically monoclinic or monoclinic + hexagonal. Minor arsenopyrite was found locally in a fault intersection; traces of sphalerite and chalcopyrite have been identified. Minor S as a sublimate forms veins at the surface, but hydrothermal SO4 minerals are in trace amounts only. Grains of primary (detrital) barite were identified in metasediments. Minor amounts of As and Sb sulphides occur at the surface in the main thermal zone. Within that area Hg was previously mined both as cinnabar in siliceous lenses, and adsorbed Hg&#730; in fine grain sediments. Mercury is transported through the system as Hg&#730; vapour. Downhole analyses of cuttings (30-50 m intervals) show Hg has not been leached from rocks in the reservoir, and is stable in pyrite at that temperature range (200&#730;-250&#730;C). The decrease of temperatures in the caprock (&lt;150&#730;C) allows adsorbed Hg&#730; to become stable and deposit. Gold and Ag are in low concentration in all geothermal rocks, the highest being Au = 0.07 ppm and Ag = 0.55 ppm. Gold is mostly associated with pyrite and concentrations are higher in the hot inflow zones; it is depleted in the cool inflow, presumably by subsequent dissolution. Silver occurs in pyrite, but also as other phases not identified (possibly in pyrrhotite), and is enriched in the cool inflow. Well discharge silica has relatively elevated concentrations (Au = 0.27, Ag = 13.9 ppm) and is considered analagous to sinter deposits that would form in the absence of a caprock. Sinters forming to the N of the thermal area, contain very low metallic trace elements, as they form from neutral pH HCO3 waters in the caprock. Modelling the hydrology of the overall system and using Au bisulphide solubilities suggests the likelihood that Au (and base metals) have deposited from the fluids in upflow zones before they enter the reservoir. This model appears to be supported by greater mineralisation in well Ng5 samples, in the N of the drillfield.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Markovian Quantum Trajectories</field><field name="creator">Jack, Michael Wong</field><field name="description">The technique of quantum trajectories (stochastic Schr&#246;dinger equations or Monte Carlo wave functions) for open systems is generalized to the non-Markovian regime. I consider a microscopic model of an open system consisting of a boson field coupled linearly (with an excitation preserving coupling) to a localized system. The model allows for a field with an arbitrary dispersion relation and an arbitrary mode-dependent coupling to the system. The trajectories are formulated as continuous measurements of the output field from the system. For a general dispersive field these measurements must be distributed in space for this formulation to be possible. The result of this formulation is a non-Markovian equation for the system conditioned on the measurements. A method of numerically simulating this equation has been determined and implemented in some test cases. Numerical simulation is possible if one can introduce a finite memory time for the evolution of the reduced system. As an illustration, the method is applied to the spectral detection of the emission from a driven two-level atom and also to an atom radiating into an electromagnetic field where the free space modes of the electromagnetic field are altered by the presence of a cavity. In both cases the non-Markovian behaviour arises from the uncertainty in the time of emission of a photon that is later detected (or reabsorbed), although, in the second case, the non-Markovian behaviour is intrinsic to the system environment coupling whereas, in the spectral detection case, it is a consequence of the choice of measurement process. The generalization of the techniques of quantum trajectories to the non-Markovian regime promises to make a range of open system problems where the Born-Markov approximation is invalid tractable to numerical simulation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Collins, Terence James</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium [LnM-CS]. In chapter 1 a comprehensive review of all transition metal thiocarbonyl complexes is presented. Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon monosulphide is a highly reactive molecule which does not exist under normal laboratory conditions. However, transition metal complexes of this reactive intermediate are typically stable compounds of which there are now approximately two hundred reported examples. This small number has made a complete review possible. Slow spasmodic growth has accompanied transition metal thiocarbonyl chemistry since the prototype complex was discovered in 1966 and chapter 1 discusses the synthetic reasons for this, describes critically the current bonding models, and presents the reactions of thiocarbonyl complexes. The very new field of the chemistry of selenocarbonyl complexes [LnM-CSe] is included and comparison with this and with the well-documented chemistry of carbonyl complexes allows for an analysis of periodic changes. The review indicates that CS ligand reactions had received little attention at the outset of this project. Interligand reactions involving CS were unknown primarily because thiocarbonyl complexes containing ligands suitable for investigating reactions of this type had not been synthesised. In particular, transfer of hydrido or aryl ligand to CS had not been observed. Such reactions are the subjects of chapters 3 and 6. The investigation of these transfer reactions necessitated the prior preparation of complexes containing hydrido or aryl ligands cis to the thiocarbonyl ligand. Suitable complexes were synthesised from the very versatile synthetic intermediate OsCl2 (CS) (PPh3)3 [Chapter 3], which was discovered after considerable effort had been devoted to finding high yield routes for introducing the CS ligand into the coordination sphere of ruthenium and osmium [Chapter 2]. Chapter 3 is concerned with hydride transfer to the CS ligand. The thioformyl ligand [OS-C-H-S] results from the transfer of one hydrido ligand to CS and subsequent reactions, which are also probably hydride transfers, produce the thioformaldehyde [Os-S-C-H-H] and methylthiolato [Os-SCH3] ligands. The possible relevance of these ligands as models for postulated intermediates in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is noted. The thioformyl and thioformaldehyde ligands were hitherto unknown and the formulations have been additionally verified by investigating the reactivity of these novel ligands and characterising the derivatives obtained. A synthetic route to secondary carbine complexes and to nitrogen and oxygen equivalents of the thioformyl ligand [Os-C-H&#8212;NMe and Os-C-H&#8212;O] is demonstrated. The review in chapter 1 also recounts how observation has shown that strong &#963;-donor and strong &#960;-acceptor properties of the CS ligand exert a profound effect upon the reactivity of CS complexes. In particular, strong &#960;-acceptor properties mark the CS ligand as an ideal candidate for stabilising very electron-rich metal centres such as d8 ruthenium(O) or osmium(O). In chapter 4 high yield routes to zerovalent osmium thiocarbonyl complexes are detailed and the reactivity of these complexes is exploited to afford the first high yield syntheses of dithiocarbonyl complexes. The thiocarbonyl ligand is also viewed, from the collected information in chapter 1, as being more responsive to the coordinative environment than the better-known carbonyl ligand. Thus, while CS can remove more electron-density from basic metal centres than CO, CS can also donate more electron-density than CO when coordinated to very electron-poor metal centres. Consequently, it is not surprising that reactions which have been regarded in a classical sense as electrophilic or nucleophilic attack at CO are also found for CS. In chapter 5 several novel reactions which can be described as nucleophilic attack at the CS carbon atom are reported for both neutral and cationic complexes. One such reaction is an interligand reaction of cis thiocarboxamido and thiocarbonyl ligands which affords a four-membered osmium metallocycle. Chapter 6 describes how coordinatively unsaturated aryl-thiocarbonyl-containing complexes react with potentially bidentate anionic ligands to produce coordinatively saturated complexes. coordinative saturation also occurs with carbon monoxide or isocyanide and these latter compounds undergo a rearrangement reaction which involves the thiocarbonyl ligand. Available evidence, which includes the results of an incomplete X-ray crystal structure determination, suggests that a bidentate thioacyl ligand [Os-S-C-R] is produced by transfer of the aryl ligand to CS with ring-closure. Some further reactions of this novel ligand are also discussed. In conclusion, the work reported here extends this research group&#8217;s interest in the chemistry of low valent transition metal compounds and the ligands which stabilise such compounds to thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium. The present status of the chemistry of transition metal thiocarbonyl complexes has been examined and the work presented in the experimental chapters contributes to this small area of chemistry by examining, for the first time, interligand reactions which involve CS, by providing synthetic routes to CS complexes of osmium(O), and by beginning to examine the synthetic potential of the novel compounds and ligands obtained.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic studies of chemically synthesised polyaniline and its ability to act as radical scavenger</field><field name="creator">Gizdavic-Nikolaidis, Marija</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

The first section examines certain stability properties of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, a new stability property is defined, which is a modification to non-autonomous problems of A-stability, and its relation to B-stability is considered. A Runge-Kutta method is written as [see 01front.pdf for graphic] and classes of methods are constructed based on the property &#8721;sj=1aijck-1j = cki/k, i = 1,...,s and k = 1,...,s-1, where c1,...,cs are assumed to be distinct. Under this assumption a transformation is made, such that A = VsAsV-1s, where Vs is the Vandermonde matrix whose (i,j) element is cj-1i, and As has a special structure. These methods are examined in the light of the various stability criteria. It is also shown that the growth of errors can be estimated by an extension of this new stability theory and a number of examples are given. In the second section we consider the solution of stiff differential equations by implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, we examine a procedure suggested by Butcher [6] which enables an efficient implementation of Runge-Kutta methods. He has shown that the most efficient methods when using this implementation are those whose characteristic polynomial of the Runge-Kutta matrix has a single real s-fold zero. Based on this criterion a family of methods, called singly-implicit methods, is constructed, and results concerning their maximum attainable order and stability properties are given. Some consideration is also given to showing how local error estimates can be obtained, by the use of embedding techniques, for both singly-implicit methods and the more general family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. Finally, an algorithm based on these singly-implicit methods is presented. It is tested on a number of stiff differential equations, and comparisons are made between this algorithm and others currently in use.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Refraction of Satellite Signals</field><field name="creator">Heron, M. L. (Malcolm Lewis), 1944-</field><field name="description">Work began in March 1967 with the design and construction of the fixed interferometer (described in Chapter 2) for measuring the elevation angle of arrival of 20MHz signals from the satellite Beacon-B. Also during this first year most of the computing was completed for the theoretical calculations on ray paths presented in Chapter 5; these results along with some previously obtained experimental results form the basis of a paper accepted by Radio Science. Records were obtained from the interferometer from April 1968 to the end of the transmitting life of Beacon-B in January 1970. The analysis of the phase traces from the two aperture interferometer was complicated by the automatic antenna switching procedures; each transit had to be annotated and the useful chart delineated manually before the analysts recorded the phase at intervals of a few seconds on a semi-automatic digital recording system. The antenna switching was designed to save electronics and one channel on the chart recorder, but lead to a computer programming effort which may have been more costly in time and lost transits than the saving achieved by avoiding two separate interferometers (Chapter 2). While this programming and analysis were going on, the computing delays on the University&#8217;s overworked IBM 1130 gave time to follow up the idea of recording the fast Faraday fading on 20 MHz signals from a satellite near to or even below the horizon. This project was simplified by the availability of an easily converted 20 MHz receiver and a digital recording system. The report on this project is given in Chapter 4 and also in a short paper. The elevation angle measurements from the interferometer were converted to virtual height increment versus equivalent vertical frequency plots and thence to electron density profiles (Chapter 3, Part I). This analysis was developed from ideas given originally by Titheridge (1964). The interpretation of the resulting values of the scale height at the peak (Chapter 3, Part II) in terms of ionosphere morphology depended heavily on the total content hourly values maintained on computer disk by Dr Titheridge. The results and discussion in Chapter 3 will be presented as a separated paper. Chapter 6 is a review of the effects of the ionosphere on transmitted satellite signals and in particular gives a wider view of Faraday fading than is normally taken. Because of its general nature Chapter 6 can serve as an introduction to satellite radio propagation techniques; it appears at the end of this thesis as common ground after the diversions of Chapters 4 and 5. Since this work falls into three separate projects of ray elevation angle measurements, fast Faraday fading, and second order Faraday rotation calculations, the reports on each have been written with minimal cross referencing; this should facilitate reading but has resulted in a small amount of repetition.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291710 Radio communications and broadcasting not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactions of Hydrocarbons on Raney Nickel in the Presence of Adsorbed Tritium</field><field name="creator">Long, Mervyn Allan</field><field name="description">The exchange of a number of hydrocarbons with tritium on a Raney nickel catalyst has been investigated for the purpose of developing a procedure for labelling such compounds with tritium.

Unfortunately many cannot be solved exactly. This is why the ability to solve these equations numerically is important. Traditionally mathematicians have used one of two classes of methods for numerically solving ordinary differential equations. These are linear multistep methods and Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. General linear methods were introduced as a unifying framework for these traditional methods. They have both the multi-stage nature of Runge&#8211;Kutta methods as well as the multi-value nature of linear multistep methods. This extremely broad class of methods, besides containing Runge&#8211;Kutta and linear multistep methods as special cases, also contains hybrid methods, cyclic composite linear multistep methods and pseudo Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. In this thesis we present a class of methods known as Almost Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. This is a special class of general linear methods which retains many of the properties of traditional Runge&#8211;Kutta methods, but with some advantages. Most of this thesis concentrates on explicit methods for non-stiff differential equations, paying particular attention to a special fourth order method which, when implemented in the correct way, behaves like order five. We will also introduce low order diagonally implicit methods for solving stiff differential equations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrological impacts of urban development in the Albany Basin, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Herald, John R. (John Raymond)</field><field name="description">In several areas of Auckland, urban development has resulted in flooding and siltation problems that have been both difficult and expensive to manage. This study investigates the fluvial processes of runoff and sediment generation with a pastoral catchment of the Albany Basin and assesses the potential hydrological impacts of urban development with its catchment area. During the study period this catchment was on the fringe of the urban development of Auckland's North Shore. By examining the factors that control runoff and sediment generation within a pastoral catchment, site information that may be useful for controlling runoff and sediment generation within an urbanised Albany Basin is gained. To assess the impacts of urban development, streamflows and suspended sediment yields from catchments representative of three different land uses are compared: pastoral, urban construction and developed urban. Stream channel enlargement indices for a number of nearby catchments with different proportions of urban land cover are also determined and compared. The study shows significant increases in stormflows and suspended sediment yields from catchments that are either fully developed or undergoing construction for urban use. But due to the relatively dry weather experienced during the study period these results are thought to underestimate the impact of urbanising the Albany Basin. The investigation of stream channel enlargement shows that for totally urban catchments stream channel cross-sectional areas may be nearly three times those for pastoral catchments. Methods for controlling the impact of urban development on streamflows, sediment yields and channel enlargement are discussed. It is proposed that by developing techniques where by storm runoff is dispersed and stored within the considerable soil moisture storage capacity of an urban land cover, of the type planned for the Albany Basin, that a considerable reduction in stormflow and sediment generation may be achieved. The study concludes that through careful land use planning and the use of appropriate control structure the impacts of urban development may be reduced to acceptable levels.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of ethyl cellulose based grafting copolymers</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Betty Qilan</field><field name="description">Copolymerisation of ethyl cellulose (EC) with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and vinyl acetate was carried out in solution, using a number of free radical initiators, to form graft copolymers with grafting yields up to 63% and weight average molecular weight about 9 x 104 g mol-1 Graft copolymerisation of MMA and EC appears to involve participation of comonomer charge transfer complexes at the initial stage of reaction, Interaction of EC with the carbonyl group of MMA enhances the electron-accepting ability of EC and promotes the formation of a donor-acceptor complex as matrix, with the resultant generation of a covalent bonded monomer radical, which then propagates in the usual manner to produce EC-g-PMMA. The influence of a number of experimental variables on the grafting efficiency of the EC-g-PMMA reaction, and the properties of the resulting copolymers, was investigated. The initiator has a significant effect on the grafting efficiency, which decreases in the order azobisisobutyronitril&gt;ammonium persulphate&gt;potassium persulphate&gt;Ce(IV) ion. Benzoyl peroxide was found to be unsuitable because it promoted degradation of ethyl cellulose chains. The order of solvent influence on the grafting yield is chloroform&gt;toluene&gt;benzene. The grafting yield is also reaction time and temperature dependent. A2-3 hour reaction time and 40-50&#176;C reaction temperature gives a substantial increase in both reaction rate and the molecular weight of the graft copolymer product. The introduction of PMMA graft side chains onto EC main chains leads to a significant decrease in the radius of gyration in solution, as determined by size exclusion chromatography, compared to linear EC. This finding is explained by the theory of Stockmayer and Fixman in terms of the number and type of long chain graft points in the molecule, Calculation of viscosity of EC-g-PMMA in solution using the Kurata equation gave values in good agreement with the experimentally determined viscosity. A significant result is that grafting PMMA branches onto EC reduces the hydrodynamic volume, and differential scanning calorimetry showed conclusively that increasing PMMA sidechain length reduces the chain flexibility, by reduction of free volume. The glass transition temperature of EC-g-PMMA, produced by using a large excess of MMA monomer and reasonably long reaction time, was shifted to higher temperature with increase of grafting yield and molecular weight. A single glass transition is observed for copolymers made using low initiator concentrations, and two glass transitions are found for higher initiator concentrations. In addition, EC-g-PMMA samples with higher grafting yield are more brittle than those with lower grafting yield. However, both the bending modulus (determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) and elongation at break increase with grafting yield. Our experiments proved that the crystallinity of EC-g-PMMA is less than that of pure EC and greater than that of pure amorphous PMMA. The specific oxygen gas-permeability coefficients of EC-g-PMMA films decrease with increase of grafting yield. The reason is that grafting decreases of hydrodynamic volume. Interestingly, X-ray diffraction showed that the higher the grafting yields of EC-g-PMMA, the higher its crystallinity. Films of EC-blend-PMMA, made by solution casting and examined in cross section using scanning electron microscopy, showed an essentially multiple layer morphology with non-uniform dispersion of PMMA in the EC matrix. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed, as expected, that EC-g-PMMA cast films were homogeneous with no evidence of phase separation. The tensile strength of EC-g-PMMA films was typically about 20% higher than that of EC-blend-PMMA films, and the graft copolymer films exhibited greater oxygen permeability. A new model for graft copolymerisation to EC is proposed. The model provides for the possibility that grafting to EC with 48% ethoxy content can occur at the five OC2H5 groups and one OH group per unit. It was established using NMR spectrometry of EC-g-PMMA and EC-g-Poly (vinyl acetate) that under some conditions the ethoxy groups are the favoured graft sites. The liquid crystalline properties of EC and EC-g-PMMA were extensively investigated. Optical microscopy with crossed polarisers revealed that the relatively short mesomorphic temperature range of ethyl cellulose is extended downwards almost to ambient temperature in the graft copolymer. Low frequency Raman scattering showed that EC-g-PMMA has higher light scattering intensity than EC at ambient temperature. But it was lower than that of EC at 191&#176;C. Moreover, the Jaynes-Cummings model cannot predict the light scattering intensity of EC-g-PMMA as a function of frequency very well, whereas the EIT-Kerr scheme is able to successfully account for the experimental observations. It was found that EC and EC-g-PMMA are pseudoplastic, lyotropic and thermotropic materials whose viscosity in solution is dependent on many factors, particularly on temperature and solution concentration. Both materials show unusual rheological behaviour, including maxima in the isothermal concentration dependence of viscosity. Unmodified EC exhibits thixotropic flow behaviour, whereas grafting PMMA side chains onto EC changes the flow behaviour to rheopectic, which is also typical of PMMA itself. As the temperature and concentration increase, the viscosity increases in response to the transition from an isotropic to an anisotropic state of EC-g-PMMA. Furthermore, experiments on the distinguishing characteristics of EC-g-PMMA indicate that different solvents affect its anisotropic flow behaviour to a greater or lesser extent. In particular, chloroform shows a stronger flow orientation effect than tetrachloroethane on EC-g-PMMA solutions. The rheological behaviour of EC and EC-g-PMMA in the nematic phase is much more complex than that of ordinary polymers or low molecular weight liquid crystals. The Doi theory is usually applicable to ordinary polymers or low molecular weight liquid crystals, but cannot predict shear stress as a function of shear rate; particularly at very low shear rates for EC and EC-g-PMMA. Whereas, the polydomain model is better to account for the observations. Measurements of thermally stimulated depolarisation current showed that EC-g-PMMA has a longer dipolar relaxation time in an electrical field. Molecular dipole motions of EC give a maximum depolarisation current at 138 &#176;C in the glass transition region and another maximum near 200 &#176;C, corresponding to dipolar relaxation in the liquid crystalline phase. EC-g-PMMA shows a broader dipolar relaxation temperature range in the liquid crystalline phase and the depolarisation current maximum shifts to a lower temperature. We have observed that field induced polarisation of EC-g-PMMA is affected by the length of the PMMA side chain, and obeys an interfacial model of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars type. It was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the length of the PMMA side chain could affect the surface properties. EC-g-PMMA has higher photoemission intensity than EC, and the photoemission intensity and depolarisation current increase with grafting yield.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Utilising Dehydroabietic Acid</field><field name="creator">Franich, Robert Arthur</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the utilisation of the natural product, abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid* (dehydroabietic acid) (1) for the synthesis of optically active steroids and diterpenoids. The work has been divided into three sections which describe transformations of rings A, B and C of abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid (1). Selective epoxidation of the alkene mixture (3-5) derived from oxidative decarboxylation of abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid (1) with lead tetraacetate has given the epoxides (64), (65), a low yield of the epoxide (66), and the pure exocyclic alkene (3). The alkene (3) was oxidised to the ketone (6) which has been previously employed as an intermediate for the synthesis of the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone (10). The epoxides (64) and (65) have been converted to the unsaturated ketones (89), (107), and (67), and the saturated ketones (13), (99) and (100). A study of the boron triflouride rearrangements of the three epoxides (64), (65) and (66) has been made using benzene and dimethyl suplhoxide as solvents, and pathways for the formation of the products are suggested. Peracid oxidation of the enol acetate (155) derived from the C 7-ketone (18) provided a facile introduction of oxygen substituents into the hindered C 6 position of abieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oic acid (1). By hydrogenolysis of the C 7-hydroxy substituent of the compound (162), the C 6-acetate (172) was obtained. Hydrolysis of the latter compound, and methylation of the acid formed gave the C 6-alcohol (175) which was oxidised to the C 6-ketone (176). The literature pertaining to the intramolecular functionalisation of aromatic alkyl groups has been surveyed, and, with the ultimate aim of synthesizing the aromatic steroids (237) and (249), the C 13-isopropyl group of abieta-8,11-13-trien-18-oic acid (1) has been functionalised by the application of two of the published procedure, viz. the lead tetraacetate oxidation of aromatic acids, and the thermolysis of diaxomethyl ketones. Nitration of methyl 12-acetylabieta-8,11,13-trien-18-oate (227) has given products of nitrodeacylation (44) and nitrodealkylation (266). The product of nitrodealkylation (266) has been converted to methyl 13-hydroxy-podocarpa-8,11,13-trien-18-oate (59) in 36% yield. Methylation of the phenol (59), and Birch reduction of the methyl ether (276) has given podocarp-8(14)-en-18-ol-13-one (281). Annelation of the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketone (281) with bromoacetone was attempted in order to synthesize the steroid (284), but the only product identified was the furan (286). * The numbering system used throughout this thesis is that proposed by J.W.

Electric field strengths of resultant anodic films were calculated from galvanostatic transients. These transients showed three characteristic features: linear voltage increase, noisy high voltage signals accompanied by sparking, and sawtooth-like events characterized by instantaneous voltage drops followed by slower voltage increases. Each feature was linked to certain physical processes occurring in the metal/film/solution system. Oxidation of magnesium and magnesium alloys formed anodic films with bilayer structures: a passive barrier layer adhering to the metal electrode, topped by a porous secondary layer. Cation injection into the barrier film across the metal/oxide interface was the rate determining step for film growth. Interstitial cations migrated through the film under the influence of the electric field. At the film/solution interface they reacted with electrolyte species and either thickened the film or dissolved in solution. Electric field strength was constant for particular metal/solution combinations and was independent of applied current density. Changing the electrode material altered the resultant electric field strength: pure magnesium produced oxides with lower electric field strengths than films formed on the three magnesium alloys. Changing the electrolyte had no discernable effect on the electric field strength. Charge efficiency of the film growth process was investigated by oxygen gas evolution; efficiency decreased during sparking. Ion beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering, fluorine depth profiling and nuclear reaction analysis) coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction studies and Raman spectroscopy gave information about the anodic film surface. These techniques showed that oxides formed on magnesium-aluminium alloys were thinner than those formed on pure magnesium caused by aluminium dissolution. Fluorine depth profiling revealed that concentration profiles for fluorine in anodic oxides formed in fluoride-containing solution altered depending on the aluminium content of the electrode material.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Clemmensen Reduction of 1,4-Diketones</field><field name="creator">Crump, Douglas Ronald</field><field name="description">The mechanisms proposed for the Clemmensen reduction of simple ketones are critically examined, and the Clemmensen reduction of difunctional ketones is reviewed. The Clemmensen reduction of a number of 1,4-diketones has shown that the products formed depend on the conformation of the carbonyl groups: (a)	syn or anti-periplanar alignment of the carbonyl groups within the C2-C3 bond favours fragmentation e.g. cyclohexane-1,4-dione leads to hexane-2,5-dione and hex-5-oF-2-one, (b)	with 1,2-diacetyl systems formation 3f alcohols and furans predominates e.g. hexane-2,5-dione gives hexan-2-ol, and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, (c)	when both carbonyl groups are in a large ring (&#8805;C7) formation of cyclobutanediols is possible e.g. 2,6,6-trimethylcycloheptane-1,4-dione is reduced to 3,3,6-trimethylbucyclo[3,2,0]-1&#946;-diol, (d)	when none of these conditions is satisfied normal reduction occurs e.g. cholestane-3,6-dione yields cholestan-6-one. A mechanism is proposed for the formation of hexan-2-ol, hex-4-on-2ol, and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran from the Clemmensen reduction of hexane-2, 5-dione. The production of a number of similarly constructed 1,4-diketones and Y-functionalised ketones is also examined. The synthetic visibility of the fragmentation reaction, previously observed to occur under Clemmensen conditions, is investigated and it is shown that this is of limited value for the preparation of large rings. The stereochemical requirements for the reaction are verified and the mechanism is further studied. A review of the synthesis of 1,4-diketones is given and the preparation of the compounds used in this study is discussed in detail. The Clemmensen reduction of two 1,5-diketones is examined. The formation of cyclopropanediols and cyclopropanols from the Clemmensen reduction of some monocyclic formyl-ketones and &#946;-hydroxy-ketones is discussed. The Clemmensen reduction of hexane-2,5-dione and pentane-2,4-dione with different metals is investigated.</field><field name="date">1970</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes of sedimentation on the shoreface and continental shelf and the development of facies Pakiri, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Michael John</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the results of research of physical and biological processes of sedimentation on the shoreface and continental shelf in Pakiri Bay, on the east coast of the Northland Peninsu1a, New Zealand. These environments comprise the subtidal portion of the Pakiri sand body. Sand bodies that are contiguous with unconsolidated sediments of coastal barriers are characteristic of the embayed east coasts of the Auckland and Northland Regions, yet little is known of their geomorphology. Existing models of shoreface and shelf sedimentation afford limited assistance because they were developed in different environments. Factors that distinguish the study area from other coasts include tectonic stability, lack of modern (non-biogenic) sediment inputs, the predominance of currents related to shoaling surface waves, and a sea level stillstand for the last 6,500 years. The model of sedimentation developed is derived from intensive field investigation of the morphology, sedimentology and ecology of the Pakiri Bay shoreface and continental shelf. Investigations of sediment transport entail interpretations of the sediments and sedimentary structures of the seabed, application of existing sediment transport models and the analysis of morphodynamic data. The geomorphology of the Pakiri sediment body is characterized by a regular pattern of morphologic components and associated sediment types. Alongshore variation in these characteristics is generally minor compared with shore normal variation. The shoreface comprises a curvilinear concave surface, that extends offshore from the alongshore bar approximately 1500 m, to water depths of about 22 n. The inner continental shelf comprises an equally curvilinear, mostly convex, surface that slopes seaward to the relatively flat middle continental shelf. Secondary morphological variations result from the presence of large-scale bedforms on the middle continental shelf and landward margin of the inner shelf. The sediments of the shoreface are fine, very well sorted quartz-feldspathic sands of 2 &#248; mean grain size. The inner shelf sediments grade offshore from a medium sand to very coarse sands and fine gravels (mean grain size 0.0 to 0.5 &#248;). In contrast the sediments of the mid shelf are very fine sands (mean grain size 2.0 to 2.5 &#248;), with a mud content of 5 to l0 percent. Carbonate skeletal debris, derived mostly from molluscs, comprises a significant proportion of inner and mid shelf sediments. The concentration of carbonates in the sediments increases offshore from 0 to 5 percent on the shoreface to 30 percent at the base of the inner shelf. The carbonate fraction of the sediments is size graded on the inner shelf and mid shelf in accordance with the grain size characteristics of the non-carbonate fraction. A model of the distribution and abundance of living macrobenthos (mostly of the phyla mollusca) is derived from benthos surveys in Pakiri Bay. Species that are diagnostic of high and low energy environments are characteristic of the shoreface and middle continental shelf respectively. The pattern of carbonate concentration in the sediments of the subtidal sediment body does not correlate with the pattern of modern biogenic production. Highest levels of modern shell production occur across the shoreface, whereas carbonate concentrations are greatest at the base of the inner shelf. Hypotheses are advanced to explain this dichotomy. The geomorphology of the shoreface and inner continental shelf is seen as a response to modern processes of sedimentation. Sediment transport occurs primarily in response to currents related to shoaling waves. Two process regimes are recognized. During typically calm (swe11 wave) conditions the fine sands of the shoreface may be transported landward as a result of an onshore mass transport current. During severe storm events this process may transport bed sediments landward across the inner shelf and middle continental shelf forming the characteristic sediment and morphologic patterns observed. However, during such events this onshore flow is, probably counteracted by return flows that are able to transport eroded foreshore and inshore sediments seaward Key words: Sedimentation, shoreface, continental shelf, wave dominated, carbonated sedimentation, sediment body, facies.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Studies of Prostratin and of Oxalate Bridging</field><field name="creator">McCormick, Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis is presented in three parts.

The effect of the change in the redox-state of the compounds was determined by vibrational spectroscopic and molecular orbital techniques. The investigation of 2,7-dimethylthieno[2,3-c:5,4-c'] dipyridinium diiodide monohydrate was undertaken by X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopic and molecular-orbital techniques. These investigations showed that the thiophenic portion of the dication exhibited partial aromaticity. On formation of the radical monocation, a pattern of bond length changes consistent with the formation of a quinoidal structure was predicted by molecular-orbital calculations. This suggests that the electron delocalisation occurs over the entire molecule. The resonance Raman spectrum of the cation monoradical exhibits bands which may be assigned to the thiophenic portion, which suggests that this portion is associated with the chromophore. IR spectroscopic investigations into the electrogenerated radical of N,N'-diheptyl 4,4' - pyridinium, which has been investigated as the coloured component of electrochromic displays, were performed. The reflectance IR spectra of the radical monocations were obtained through bulk-sampling potential subtraction (PS) and surface-selective polarisation modulation (PM) techniques. The comparison between PS and PM spectra of the radical generated as a solid film in an aqueous medium, with the PS spectrum of the radical generated in acetonitrile revealed differences. These were interpreted in terms of an equilibrium between monomeric and aggregated forms of the radical. Similar results were obtained for the related compounds, methyl viologen and its dicyano substituted salt. The simplicity in the pattern of bands in the PS IR spectra of the monomeric radicals of methyl- and dicyanomethyl viologens was investigated by calculating the IR spectra of the dications and cation radicals of these compounds by molecular orbital techniques. The intense spectral features could be interpreted in terms of a charge-oscillation of the radical electron across the pyridine rings. The dipole moment of such modes is large and leads to the enhancement of these modes. The effect of various counterions associated with heptyl viologen was investigated by Raman and IR techniques. The pattern of bands in the Raman spectrum exhibited little variation with differing the counterions. The PS IR spectra exhibited disappearance features associated with the counterion in contrast to the PM spectra where no such bands were observed. PS IR spectra were also obtained by synchronising data acquisition with potential sweeps. The intensity of disappearance features in the PS IR spectra attributable to the CH modes varied at a similar rats to bands assigned to the radical aggregate. This suggested that a reorientation of the dipyridine ring and the quaternising alkyl chain probably occurs on reduction to form the radical. The lack of reversibility associated with the degradation of viologen films was investigated by PS IR techniques. The effect is probably associated with changes in the composition of the solid rather than a change in the concentrations of the monomeric and aggregated forms of the viologen radical. Dialkyl bridged diquaternary compounds of 2,2'-dipyridine were investigated by IR and theoretical techniques. The observation that the calculated dihedral angles for the dications and cation radicals were similar allowed the trends in the electronic absorption maxima (ultra-violet) and electrode potentials to be interpreted. Selective enhancements of bands in the PS IR spectra of the radicals suggest that a charge-oscillation mechanism may also be operative in these compounds. The utility of a combination of structural, theoretical and vibrational spectroscopic studies is demonstrated in these studies.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The soil seed bank in Agathis australis (D.

Don) Lindl. (kauri) forests of northern New Zealand is quantified, and its potential role in secondary successions examined. Seed bank data from a number of kauri forest sites stratified by successional time and distance from forest edges are summarized using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (ordination) and linear regression models. A number of issues concerning secondary successions and the soil seed bank are discussed. These include: 1. The relationship between the soil seed bank and extant vegetation. 2. The nature of the soil seed bank and successional time. 3. The nature of the soil seed bank and distance from forest edges. 4. The soil seed bank, canopy gaps and gap regeneration strategies. 5. The nature of the soil seed bank and soil properties. 6. The fruiting phenology, seed rain, and soil seed bank dynamics. The forest sites ranged from 50 years to over 1,000 years old, while distance from forest edges ranged from 0.2 km to 3.5 km. Soil seed bank densities under kauri forests were 134 - 5,388 seeds m-2 with a mean density of 1,320&#177;217 seeds m-2 which is similar to estimates reported for temperate and tropical forest sites elsewhere. The spatial distribution of seeds in the seed bank both within and between sites is highly variable. A total of 6,062 seedlings emerged from the seed bank samples. This represented 62 vascular plant species, 26 (42%) native woody, 19 (30%) native weedy, 16 (26) adventive weedy and 1 (2%) native fern. The species composition of the soil seed bank was not closely related to extant vegetation and only 11%ot canopy and 13% of understorey species were represented in the soil seed bank. Thus, 77% of extant vegetation at any given site is floristically different from that of the soil seed bank. Ordination of the data by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) suggested that extant vegetation (canopy and understorey) and the soil seed bank contain characteristic floras. The species composition of the seed bank is variable between sites. The viable seed pool is larger under young successional forests than under older mature forests. The number of species also declined with distance from forest edges. Adventive and native weedy species were found in seed banks under mature forests and sites of considerable distances from forest edges. However, the density of the weedy species component of the soil seed bank was at least partly determined by distance from forest edges where such species are common. While buried seed is likely to contribute to the early stages of secondary succession, evidence from canopy gaps suggested that the seedling bank (formerly suppressed understorey component) is more important in gap regeneration than the soil seed bank. DCA analysis revealed that seedling bank species composition of canopy gaps and forest sites were quite different from the soil seed banks, indicating that regeneration stemmed from formerly (suppressed) understorey seedlings. Phenology and seed rain study of a mature forest remnant and a regenerating forest community showed that as little as 5% of the seed input to the forest floor enters the soil seed bank and remains viable for more than one year. Evidence is presented to suggest that in a forest community, secondary succession after large-scale or localised disturbance, is achieved more so by suppressed seedlings and recent seed rain than the soil seed bank. The soil seed bank becomes significant in secondary succession when the subsoil is disturbed by the uprooting of trees or the forest floor is exposed by tree-fall (not covered by tree-fall debris).</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Contribution to the Chemistry of Solasonine and Some Solanum Species</field><field name="creator">Hoare, John Leonard</field><field name="description">Introduction: General. The family Solanaceae, to which the Solanurn genus belongs, is  comprised of some 70 genera and approximately 2000 species. Its  members, which are herbs, erect or climbing shrubs and, occasionally,  small trees, are distributed in the tropical and extend to the temperate  regions, the greatest concentration being in Central and Southern  America. The family's chief point of interest chemically is the  fact that many of its members contain alkaloids, well known examples  being Atropa belladonna (containing atropine), Datura strammonium(daturine), Nicotiana tobacum (nicotine), and Solmum tuberosum (solanine).  The Solanum (Latin - solamen, solace or quieting) genus is made up  of some 1,200 species, three of which, S. tuberosum (potato),  S. lycopersicum = Lycopersicum esculentum Mill. ( tomato), and S . nigrum  (a common weed of cultivation), are especially well known. New Zealand  has one endemic species, namely S. aviculare Forst. Agriculturally,  mainly because of S. tuberosum and S. lycopersicum, the genus is of course  an important one but in addition several species are used in horticulture,  e.g. S. pseudocapsicum and S. macrmthum, and a few species, e.g.  S. mammosum and S. dulcamara, are reported as being of medicinal  value. Chemically it is unique, in that may species contain glycosidic  steroidal alkaloids and most attention has been devoted to the characterisation  of these substances, although various other constituents, e.g.  commarins and anthocyanins, have been reported.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queueing and Storage Control Models</field><field name="creator">Sheu, Ru-Shuo</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Symmetric Forced Oscillators</field><field name="creator">Ben-Tal, Alona</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study a class of symmetric forced oscillators modeled by non-linear ordinary differential equations. Solutions for this class of systems can be symmetric or non-symmetric. When a symmetric periodic solution loses its stability as a physical parameter is varied, and two non-symmetric periodic solutions appear, this is called a symmetry breaking bifurcation. In a symmetry increasing bifurcation two conjugate chaotic attractors (i.e.,attractors which are related to each other by the symmetry) collide and form a larger symmetric chaotic attractor. Symmetry can also be restored via explosions where, as a physical parameter is varied, two conjugate attractors (chaotic or periodic) which do not intersect are suddenly embedded in one symmetric attractor. In this thesis we show that all these apparently distinct bifurcations can be realized by a single mechanism in which two conjugate attractors collide with a symmetric limit set. The same mechanism seems to operate for at least some bifurcations involving non-attracting limit sets. We illustrate this point with examples of symmetry restoration in attracting and non-attracting sets found in the forced Duffing oscillator and in a power system. Symmetry restoration in the power system is associated with a phenomenon known as ferroresonance. The study of the ferroresonance phenomenon motivated this thesis. Part of this thesis is devoted to studying one aspect of the ferroresonance phenomenon the appearance of a strange attractor with a band-like structure. This attractor was called previously a 'pseudo-periodic' attractor. Some methods for analyzing the non-autonomous systems under study are shown. We construct three different maps which highlight different features of symmetry restoring bifurcations. One map in particular captures the symmetry of a solution by sampling it every half the period of the forcing. We describe a numerical method to construct a bifurcation diagram of periodic solutions and present a non-standard approach for converting the forced oscillator to an autonomous system.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemistry of low-valent osmium</field><field name="creator">Grundy, Kevin Rodger</field><field name="description">This study concerns the synthesis, structure and reactivity of complexes of d&#8310; and d&#8312; osmium.

With base, [OsH(CO)(CH&#8323;N)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;]ClO4 affords OsH(OH)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; from which a series of hydroxide complexes OsH(OH)(CO)(L)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; (L=CO, TIC ETPO) can be obtained. The hydroxide group in OsH(OH)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; is cleaved by acids HX to yield OsHX(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323; (X=F, Br, Cl, I, CH&#8322;, CF&#8322;, SC&#8327;H&#8327;, OClO&#8323;).

From the values of vCO for this series can be gained some understanding of the bonding properties of the anionic ligands.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase characterisation and kinetic studies</field><field name="creator">Cleverly, Douglas Robert</field><field name="description">Chapter One begins with an introduction to enzymology and leads into a discussion on BSSL beginning with the physical properties and the source of the enzyme. The literature concerning the kinetic properties of BSSL is reviewed, followed by a discussion on how the structure of enzymes influences their catalytic activity and specificity. The use of X-ray crystallographic techniques is addressed as a means of elucidating the three dimensional structure of enzymes. The chemicals, apparatus and standard methodologies used in this present investigation are described in Chapter Two. The means by which kinetic data measured for an enzyme-substrate system are analysed and compared are also discussed. Chapter Three describes the purification of bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase (BSSL) from whole human milk. A detailed study of the activity of the purified protein has been conducted against both lipid and ester substrates in order to monitor the progress of the purification. A further determination of the physical properties of the protein has also been conducted. Results from these studies have identified the protein as BSSL. In Chapter Four the methods used for determining the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme are described. This study has revealed interesting homologies with enzymes from other species. The sequence of that part of the enzyme which includes the active site has been determined and has been found to be identical to the consensus sequence found in the active site of pancreatic lipase, serine proteases and cholinesterases. It may therefore be postulated that the similarity observed for some of the kinetic behaviour of enzymes arises from homology in their amino acid sequences and, in particular, those portions of the protein comprising the active site. The use of kinetic isotope effects, to gain insight as to the mechanism of BSSL catalysed hydrolysis of lipid substrates, is the subject of Chapter Five. A mechanism has been proposed which explains the observed effects and takes into account information from the literature. The mechanism also incorporates findings made from the amino acid sequence study and the literature reports on the residues involved in catalysis. Chapter Six begins within a literature survey of detergent less microemulsions and continues with an account of the kinetic properties of BSSL in this new and novel medium in which enzymic reactions involving substrates of low water solubility may be conducted. The advantage of this medium is that it allows one to monitor the reaction by spectrophotometric means. In more traditional methods of assay of lipid substrates this is not normally possible. This advantage has also been exploited in the study of the kinetics of BSSL against triolein in reversed micelles, which is the subject of Chapter Seven. A detailed description is given of an FT-IR technique which allows one to monitor the course of reaction of biologically important substrates.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology of the Coromandel region with emphasis on some economic aspects</field><field name="creator">Skinner, D. N. B. (David N. B.)</field><field name="description">An account is given of the early geological exploration and mining history of the Coromandel Goldfield. The writer's interpretation of the basement and igneous geology, and of the metallogenesis of gold-silver and base metal ores has resulted in radical changes. The original threefold sub-division of the Jurassic sedimentary basement rocks (Manaia Hill Group) has been condensed to two formations (Tokatea Hill and Manaia Hill) on the basis of their detrital content and structure; standard sections are described. The older (Manaia Hill Formation) is characterised by lithic volcanic greywacke- and subgreywacke-type sedimentary rocks, that were derived from a landmass comprising an assemblage of calc-alkaline volcanic and plutonic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks. The deposit was formed by turbidity currents on a continental slope bordering a geosyncline. Secondary minerals diagnostic of low grade metamorphism of the Zeolite and Prehnite-Pumpellyite Facies occur locally in the Manaia Hill Formation. These not only include normal prehnite, laumontite-leonhardite, analcime, and actinolite, but also prehnite with anomalously low refractive indices. In contrast, the rocks of the younger formation (Tokatea Hill) are feldspathic greywackes almost devoid of volcanic detritus except near the formation boundary with Manaia Hill Formation. They have a sericiterich, authigenic matrix, but no zeolites or prehnite. The sediments were derived from a landmass of low relief composed of granodiorite-diorite plutonic rocks and minor sedimentary rocks. The lower parts of the formation are slope turbidites while the upper parts are the product of stable deposition in deeper water. The structure of the Manaia Hill Group is relatively simple over most of the Coromandel area. The beds have a north-west to north-north-west strike and are folded about axes with a similar trend; joint directions corroborate this conclusion. A north-east trend has been imposed on the rocks of the Moehau region by the intrusion of Paritu Quartz-diorite. Conformity between the two formations is shown by gradational detrital content and by structural continuity. In older descriptions, the volcanic rocks of Coromandel were subdivided into an older, gold-bearing, and a younger, barren series of andesites with minor dacites and rhyolites. By ignoring post-eruptional properties (i.e. hydrothermal alteration) a different view of the volcanic stratigraphy is demonstrated. The extrusive rocks are now subdivided into nine formations with no major regional break but with disconformity or unconformity between them caused by local quiescence. With the addition of two intrusive formations with volcanic affinities (Castle Rock Dacite and Kai-iti Porphyrites) all the volcanic rocks are included together as the Coromandel Group of Miocene age. The new effusive formations from oldest youngest are: Port Charles Andesite; Omoho Formation (rhyolitic); Kokumata Dacite; Te Karaka Andesite; Cousin Jack Andesite; Parakete Formation (dacite-andesite); Rauporoa Basaltic-andesite; Tuateawa Andesite; and Beesons Island Volcanics (andesite-dacite). The last formation has been considerably redefined since it is the sole surviving name from earlier published descriptions of the volcanic geology. Two zeolites (phillipsite and levyne) are described. Hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation cut across formation boundaries and are controlled by fault and shear zones. The writer, unlike earlier workers, recognises faults as important in the development of the geology. The fracture pattern in the basement rocks not only controls the regional fault pattern but also the fracture pattern in the volcanic rocks immediately overlying the basement. Stress patterns have been synthesised from structural analyses of faults, shears, veins, and gold-bearing lodes, which suggest that since the Mesozoic, a major compressional stress has been directed approximately north-east/south-west. A local secondary stress (north-north-west/south-south/east) is indicated during the mid-Tertiary. Major late Tertiary normal fault movement is explained by postulating horizontal tension relief by gravity following differential vertical movement along pre-existing faults, as a result of doming induced by intrusion and eruption of magma. A regional gravity survey has been tied to the known geology and structure. Models of possible mass distribution are computed for individual Bouguer anomalies. Major geological features are confirmed but stations are too spread to relate mineralisation with the gravity pattern. The results of a stream sediment reconnaissance geochemical survey of cold extractable and total copper, lead, and arsenic, are appraised in relation to known geological structural and historical features. The effects of pH, flocculants, and contamination are considered and the analytical methods reviewed. The standards of anomalous concentration levels are statistically calculated, and related to different possible sources of metal within a given terrain. Recommendations for further exploration and analytical work are made for those areas where possible economic mineralisation has been detected. In particular, the Moehau region near Paritu Quartz-diorite shows strong signs of copper enrichment. No examples of ore from any of the old mines were available; the study of the sulphide mineralisation has been confined to outcrops of veins, and samples from tip-heads. Although many of the samples show indefinite mineral relationships, the similarity of paragenetic sequence for all areas suggests that the deductions for the whole field are valid. Several minerals have not been previously recorded from Coromandel, notably wolframite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite and tetrahedrite. The structural control of mineralisation by the fracture pattern is emphasised, and also the absence of any direct genetic relationship to the volcanic rocks of the Coromandel Group. Instead, there is a zonal genetic relationship of the ore minerals of the Moehau region about Paritu Quartz-diorite. The similarity of the paragenetic sequence of other deposits to that of the Moehau region suggests similar sources, i.e. hydrothermal exhalations from consolidating subjacent granodiorite-type plutons. Whilst future economic prospects for Coromandel itself my depend on deeper workings approaching such bodies, the Paritu Quartz-diorite pluton could contain a more accessible porphyry copper deposit, with associated tungsten and molybdenum minerals.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnomathematics: Exploring Cultural Diversity in Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Barton, Bill, 1948-</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a new conceptualisation of ethnomathematics which avoids some of the difficulties which emerge in the literature. In particular, work has been started on a philosophic basis for the field. There is no consistent view of ethnomathematics in the literature. The relationship with mathematics itself has been ignored, and the philosophical and theoretical background is missing. The literature also reveals the ethnocentricity implied by ethnomathematics as a field of study based in a culture which has mathematics as a knowledge category. Two strategies to over come this problem are identified: universalising the referent of &#8216;mathematics&#8217; so that it is the same as &#8220;knowledge-making&#8221;; or using methodological techniques to minimise it. The position of ethnomathematics in relationship to anthropology, sociology, history, and politics is characterised on a matrix. A place for ethnomathematics is found close the anthropology of mathematics, but the aim of anthropology is to better understand culture in general, while ethnomathematics aims to better understand mathematics. Anthropology, however, contributes its well-established methodologies for overcoming ethnocentricity. The search for a philosophical base finds a Wittgensteinian orientation which enables culturally based &#8216;systems of meaning&#8217; to gain credibility in mathematics. A definition is proposed for ethnomathematics as the study of mathematical practices within context. Four types of ethnomathematical activity are identified: descriptive, archaeological, mathematising, and analytical activity. The definition also gives rise to a categorisation of ethnomathematical work along three dimensions: the closeness to conventional mathematics; the historical time; and the type of host culture. The mechanisms of interaction between mathematical practices are identified, and the imperialistic growth of mathematics is explained. Particular features of ethnomathematical theory are brought out in a four examples. By admitting the legitimacy of other viewpoints, ethnomathematics opens mathematics to new creative forces. Within education, ethnomathematics provides new choices, and turns cultural conflict into a useful tool for teaching. Mathematical activity exists in a variety of contexts. Learning mathematics involves being aware of, and integrating, diverse concepts. Ethnomathematics expands mathematical horizons, so that cultural diversity becomes a richer contributor to the cultural structures which humans use to understand their world.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tastant interactions with model membranes</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Patricia</field><field name="description">A wide range of compounds elicit the sweet taste response but currently it is not known what causes this response. In Chapter 3 a number of sweeteners, and representatives of all the taste groups are investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The T1 relaxation times of the tastants were determined in aqueous solution and in solution with liposomes, a model membrane system. The observed changes in T1, values are analysed to determine which regions of the tastants are involved in the interaction with the membrane. In Chapters 4 and 5 an investigation is reported of the interaction of tastants with a liquid membrane system, which is reportedly able to distinguish between classes of chemicals. The interest lies in developing a simple experiment that will enable taste qualities to be predicted, something that is currently not possible. In Chapters 6 and 7 the NMR assignments of some sweeteners is discussed. NMR assignments are a necessary precursor before their sweetening properties can be studied by NMR.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrolysis of amides and ureas in acid solutions</field><field name="creator">Giffney, Carolyn Janet</field><field name="description">Despite the vast amount of research reported on the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of amides, the mechanism of reaction has remained a source of controversy. The various literature results have been summarised in the introduction. Two series of amides have been studied in this investigation, one a series of N-substituted, 4-chlorobenzamides, the other a series of substituted acetanilides. Their basicity (or acid-dissociation) constants have been evaluated in sulphuric acid, and the rates of hydrolysis measured over a wide range of acid concentrations. Within each series, variation of the substituent causes the rate constant to vary in a way which is typical of a bimolecular reaction involving rate-determining nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated intermediate. By drawing a comparison between the two series of amides, (i.e. the difference in basicities and rates of hydrolysis) it becomes apparent that the 0-protonated amide, which is thermodynamically favoured, is not the kinetically active species, A new rate equation is proposed, the equation being based on a mechanism in which water attacks the carbonyl carbon in the rate-determining step. The equation confidently predicts the experimental rate-profiles for the acid-hydrolysis of simple amides. It has been applied, in two forms, to the experimental rate data; the first form allows for the involvement of three water molecules in the slow step of hydrolysis, and the second form allows for the involvement of only two water molecules. The rate equation, in these two forms, has also been applied to much of the hydrolysis data reported in the literature and again it has proved to be very successful. In contrast to the amides, ureas have not been subjected to extensive research. In this investigation, the basicity constants of a series of substituted phenylureas have been measured, (if not already available) and the hydrolysis reactions carried out over a wide range of sulphuric acid concentrations, as well as in water. The 4-methyl and 4-chloro-phenylureas have also been hydrolysed in a range of hydrochloric and perchloric acid solutions; the effects of added salt were studied and the solvent isotope effects on the rate were evaluated. All these results, together with information obtained from application of the Hammett equation to the rate data, were in agreement with a mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium protonation to form the minor, N-protonated conjugate acid. This is followed by a slow transfer of the proton attached to the alternate nitrogen atom to form the appropriately substituted phenylisocyanate, and rapid reaction of this intermediate to form products. The substituent effects on the n.m.r. spectra of the substituted acetanilides and phenylureas have also been reported.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Triton X Series Nonionic Surfactant Solutions</field><field name="creator">Qiao, Lijun</field><field name="description">This work contains some fundamental investigations on Triton X series nonionic surfactants from different aspects. Techniques, such as viscometry, densimetry, diffusion measurement, ultra-violet spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry, surface tension measurement and optical microscopy were employed to acquire the information. Some theoretical analyses were given to the results of these measurements. Triton X surfactants show different properties when they dissolve in different solvents. Aggregation can occur in some solvents, depending on the interactions between solvent and solute. The addition of a surfactant to a solvent will give rise to a solute-solvent interaction and change the solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions as well. From mass transport properties of the surfactant solutions, these interactions were studied and the contributions to them from each species of the solutions were calculated with a transition-state theory model which is usually used for small molecule systems. Under some reasonable assumptions, a new theoretical method was set up and was able to give a reasonable explanation for the experimental results. The surfactants can also associate with some dyes in both polar and apolar media. The ultra-violet spectra of the surfactant-dye solutions show that surfactant-dye complexes might be formed in the polar and apolar media where the surfactants form regular and reversed micelles respectively. The mechanism of the complexation reactions was studied with equilibrium theory and the charge-transfer nature of the association between the surfactant and dye revealed. The surface tension and. cloud point changes due to the addition of polyethylene glycol were determined to discover the interaction between the water-soluble polymer PEG and the surfactants at the air-solution interface and in the bulk solutions respectively. The mass distribution of the two materials between the two phases produced in the segregation (at the cloud point) of the solutions were determined by their ultra-violet adsorption spectra and densities. The analysis of the cloud point changes was given with the new concepts of polysoap and depletion flocculation. The results show that the size of the micelles, the length of the polymer chains, and the structures of the intra - chain micelles can change the mechanisms of polymer-surfactant interaction and influence the properties of the polymer/surfactant solutions. In a certain range of concentrations, the surfactants aqueous solutions can form liquid crystalline structures which can be observed under a cross-polarised microscope and determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The phase diagrams and their variations with additions of the third component, such as xylene, polyethylene glycol and BaCl2 2H2O have been determined. The effects of temperature and each of the additives on the ordered structures were analysed separately in the light of concepts of spontaneous mean curvature and "salting out" effect. Osmotic coefficients of the surfactant aqueous and methanol solutions were determined with a vapour pressure osmometer, and the activity coefficient of the solvent can be calculated with the osmotic coefficients. The change of the activity coefficient with increase of surfactant concentration shows the interactions of the surfactant with the solvent. In aqueous solution, the addition of surfactant frees the solvent molecules, leading to an activity coefficient larger than 1. In methanol solution, the surfactant addition reduces the fugacity of methanol molecules, resulting in an activity coefficient less than 1. Chemical shift changes of protons of the surfactant molecules in the lH NMR spectra show some information about the configuration of the chains, hydration, and phase structure of the solution system when the surfactant concentration changes over the whole concentration range. From 40% w/w the associated water molecules begin to be lost, and the association number ratio of water molecules and the ethylene oxide unit of the surfactant is 4:1. Electric conductance of electrolytes in the surfactant aqueous solutions are reduced by the addition of the surfactants. The reduction is more significant for large size cations, and the longer the EO chain of the surfactant, the larger the reducing effect on conductance.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of giant Kerr nonlinearity</field><field name="creator">Rebic, Stojan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the properties of an atomic system exhibiting a giant Kerr nonlinearity. The atomic energy level scheme involves four energy levels. A three level A subsystem in the atom exhibits the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), reducing the spontaneous emission noise. The fourth level leads to an ac-Stark shift of the ground state, which in turn leads to a giant, noiseless Kerr nonlinearity. Two different environments are explored. First, a system comprising of large number of atoms in an optical cavity is analysed. Detailed aspects of noise reduction in this system are investigated. In particular, strong squeezing in the quadrature in phase with the field driving the cavity mode is found, if the effective coupling of light to the atoms is strong. However, the linewidth of the predicted squeezing is found to be very narrow. This is attributed to a very steep linear susceptibility of the atomic medium. Since the widening of the squeezing window is possible only for weaker effective coupling, in turn reducing the squeezing level, a different environment is proposed. This involves a single four level atom, strongly coupled to the cavity mode. In such a strongly coupled system, the most appropriate approach is found to be that formulated in terms of polaritons &#8211; composite excitations of the 'atom-cavity molecule'. Adopting the polariton approach, nonclassical correlations in the field leaving the cavity are investigated. Strong photon antibunching is found and the effect of photon blockade predicted and described. The photon blockade effect can also be found in a system comprised of a two level atom coupled to the cavity mode, if the external driving is tuned to one of the vacuum Rabi resonances. A comparison between the two schemes is performed, and it is found that the four level scheme exhibits much better photon blockade. The reason for this is quantum interference between secondary transitions in the dressed states picture. Destructive interference cancels the transitions that would otherwise introduce a second photon into the system, hence producing a more robust photon blockade. All of these results are valid in the regime where external driving is weak. If the external driving strength is increased, the photon statistics (as measured by the zero-delay second order correlation function) changes from strong antibunching to strong bunching, over a relatively narrow range of driving strengths. The occurrence of this change can again be attributed to quantum interference. It is shown that the interference effect prevents the excitation of the composite system by a second photon, but not excitation by a two-photon transition (following the first excitation). Therefore, the third excitation manifold is excited, which then decays back to the first manifold in a two photon cascade. This two photon cascade is the source of correlated photon pairs causing an increase in the second order correlation function. The dynamics of forward scattering of light is presented, and nonclassical behaviour of the delay dependence of correlation function ('overshoots' and 'undershoots') is discussed. For the analytical treatment of this system, a method based on the polariton approach is devised, which includes the treatment of driving and damping. It is shown that this method is ideally suited to the analysis of strongly coupled systems, where only a few photons contribute to the dynamics.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of biologically active natural products - Texaline, Pseudopyronines A and B, and Varacin</field><field name="creator">Giddens, Anna Claire</field><field name="description">SAR studies on two classes of natural products, namely the terrestrial natural product texaline (2.1) and the marine derived natural products pseudopyronines A (3.64) and B (3.65) are described, as are chemical genetics studies using the cytotoxic marine natural product varacin (4.30a). The biological activities of these natural products and synthetic analogues were assessed in a variety of assays. A general methodology was developed that led to the first reported synthesis of texaline. Screening of texaline and related compounds found the oxazole natural product to be inactive against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while oxazole 2,5- diphenyloxazole (2.86) was found to possess modest antitubercular activity. In order to develop oxazoles with enhanced biological activity, analogues of 2,5- diphenyloxazole were synthesized and tested against M. tuberculosis. All structural modifications to the 2,5-diphenyloxazole scaffold resulted in diminished activity. Consequently, 2,5-diphenyloxazole remains the most active of the oxazoles prepared to date. Pseudopyronines A and B were synthesized for the first time, via CDImediated condensation of alkyl  -keto carboxylic acids. The natural products and related compounds were tested in a range of biological assays. Pyrones 3.64, 3.65 and 3.107 possessed the most potent antitubercular activity. Pseudopyronines A and B and analogues were also assessed for activity against several tropical diseases. None of the compounds exhibited significant activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi or T. brucei rhodesiense. However pyrones 3.107 and 3.105 exhibited significant in vitro activity against Leishmania donovani. Varacin (4.30b), isolated from the New Zealand ascidian Lissoclinum notti, was tested in a zebrafish embryo assay along with its N-Boc protected derivative 4.30d and analogue DMPE (4.69). Dosing zebrafish embryos with varacin and Bocvaracin at increasing concentrations afforded phenotypic changes in the embryos. Boc-varacin proved more potent than varacin in the assay, while DMPE was inactive making it a suitable negative control. Varacin and DMPE were attached to Sepharose 4B and the resulting matrices utilized in affinity chromatography experiments with the aim of uncovering varacin protein target(s). To visualize the distribution of varacin within the zebrafish embryo, attachment of fluorescent labels to DMPE and varacin was investigated. Varacin also underwent animal testing at the NCI.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Hordeum vulgare-H bulbosum recombinants using cytological and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Liangtao</field><field name="description">Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare) is an important crop and ranks fourth in overall production of the major cereal crops in the world. Like other cereal crops, barley suffers from a narrowing of its genetic base and susceptibility to diseases, pests and environmental stresses. H. bulbosum is a possible source of desirable genes for introgressing into barley to restore genetic diversity and improve current cultivars. Sexual hybridisation between barley and H. bulbosum is the main method for interspecific gene transfer in barley breeding but there are several barriers to overcome. Two of these are reduced recombination and the ability to identify recombinants quickly and efficiently. The aim in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of meiotic chromosomal behaviour in the two species and their hybrids and to improve the characterisation of recombinants from the hybrids. To study the events during meiosis, synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis was carried out on the two species and two H. vulgare - H. bulbosum hybrids. The results indicated that there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in SC length. Mean SC length was positively correlated with recombination frequency but not related to genome size. This suggests that the ratios of mean SC length to genome size (SC/DNA) show divergence among these Hordeum examples. An hypothesis based on the conformation of chromatin associated with axial element, which is dependent on SC/DNA ratio, was presented to explain the relationship between SC length and recombination frequency. Chromosome pairing in the two hybrids was determined by observation at pachytene and metaphase I (MI). Mean percentages of synapses were similar but there were different frequencies of MI pairing between these two hybrids, indicating that different mechanisms may regulate synapsis and MI pairing in the hybrids. To investigate meiotic recombination, genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) was performed on the two hybrids at MI and anaphase I (AI). It was observed that intergenomic pairing and recombination events occur in distal chromosome segments. A great discrepancy between mean pairing and recombination frequencies was observed in both hybrids and several possible reasons for this discrepancy were discussed. Hybrid 102C2 with high MI pairing had a significantly higher recombination frequency than the low pairing 103K5, suggesting that high MI pairing appears to be associated with high recombination in the hybrids. An interesting finding is that the ratio of recombination to MI pairing in 103K5 (l:8.9) is twice as high compared with 102C2 (l:17). However, the mechanism for this difference in the ratio between the two hybrids remains unknown. Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and GISH were used successfully to localise the introgressions in selfed progeny from a tetraploid hybrid derived from chromosome-doubled 102C2 (102C2/colch). This procedure is fast, cheap and can efficiently detect and locate introgressions. Several disease-resistant recombinants were analysed in more details and leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance was associated with distal introgressions on chromosomes 2HS and 2HL (leaf rust) and 2HS (powdery mildew). It is possible that the leaf rust and powdery mildew resistances were closely linked in the distal region of 2HS. A considerable variation in introgression size was observed at similar chromosomal sites among the different recombinants, which will provide useful information for map-based cloning of genes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270209 Meiosis and recombination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanistic Studies of HF Adsorption on Alumina</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Alistair Ross</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brands we love to hate: An exploration of brand avoidance</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael Shyue Wai</field><field name="description">Brands, and the process of branding, are of considerable importance in both marketing academia and practice. Although most research has focussed on the positive attitudes and behaviours that consumers have toward brands, there is a growing interest in anti-consumption. This thesis contributes to anti-consumption research by exploring the phenomenon of brand avoidance. Earlier studies investigating the avoidance of brands have been one-dimensional, failing to account for the wide range of reasons underlying brand avoidance. Therefore, this thesis addresses the limitations of existing models by providing an integrative and comprehensive approach to understanding brand avoidance. As an anti-consumption phenomenon, brand avoidance concerns the negative interaction between consumers, as social actors, and brands, as meaningful objects, within a social and historical context. Therefore, this thesis adopts an interpretive approach, a social constructionist epistemology, and historical realist ontology. Since research in the immediate area of brand avoidance is limited, this thesis employs a grounded theory methodology to analyse, code, and generate theory from the qualitative data gathered through 23 in-depth interviews. Four main types of brand avoidance (experiential, identity, deficit-value, and moral) and the circumstances in which brand avoidance may be restricted or alleviated (avoidance antidotes) emerge from the data. Existing literatures are used to further inform these findings and an original negative brand promises framework is developed to help increase understanding of the brand avoidance phenomenon. The main components of this research are then integrated into an emergent theoretical model of brand avoidance. This model offers a synopsis of how the various brand avoidance constructs may relate to one another and to other pertinent branding concepts within a consumption system. Combined, the findings of this thesis provide a comprehensive appreciation of why consumers avoid certain brands in addition to potential insights that may be used in the management of brand avoidance. Overall, this thesis contributes knowledge to the growing field of anti-consumption research by providing an innovative overview and an integrative understanding of an under-explored domain, brand avoidance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand avoidance</field><field name="subject">Anti-consumption</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Consumer resistance</field><field name="subject">Disatisfaction</field><field name="subject">Undesired self</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of calpain 3 transcripts in mammalian cells : expression of alternatively-spliced variants in non-muscle cell types</field><field name="creator">Dickson, James Michael Jeremy</field><field name="description">An investigation of the expression profile of mRNA encoding Calpain 3, the causative agent in the inherited human muscular disease Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A, was conducted in two representative mammalian species, human and mouse.  Transcripts encoding Calpain 3 were identified from mammalian tissues other than skeletal muscle.  In human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) these transcripts were identified in both the T-cell and B-cell compartments and in a number of human blood cell lines representing different haematopoietic lineages.  Calpain 3 transcripts encoding the murine homologue were also described from mouse PBMCs and from murine tissues involved in haematopoiesis.  In addition to the confirmation of Calpain 3 expression in non-skeletal muscle tissues in both these species, transcripts were identified with precise and defined deletions, which mapped to known exon-exon boundaries in the Calpain 3 gene from both species.  These deletions constituted the removal by alternative splicing of skeletal muscle-specific components of the Calpain 3 protein known to regulate its function in this tissue.  Monoclonal antibodies to the Calpain 3 protein were used to confirm the presence of Calpain 3 protein in non-skeletal muscle tissues of both human and mouse.  In humans the expression of Calpain 3 protein was confirmed in PBMCs and in the mouse, Calpain 3 expression was confirmed in tissues of the haematopoietic compartment.  In both species the Calpain 3 protein expressed correlated with translation from a transcript lacking the skeletal muscle-specific components generated by alternative splicing.  An attempt was made using a Yeast Two Hybrid assay to identify potential regulatory molecules of Calpain 3 in human PBMCs, but without a definitive candidate molecule being found.  A developmental model of muscle differentiation (murine C2C12 myoblast cells) was used to ascertain the expression profile of Calpain 3 in the early stages of myofibrillogenesis.  Using Quantitative Real Time PCR the expression profile of Calpain 3 was assessed in differentiating C2C12 cells.  These results showed that the absolute levels of Calpain 3 transcription were elevated during differentiation and that a temporal Calpain 3 isoform shift occurred during this process.  This temporal shift in expression was from transcripts having identical deletions to those seen in the haematopoietic tissues, to full length transcripts representative of skeletal muscle-specific Calpain 3. The identification of Calpain 3 expression outside skeletal muscle tissue is novel and the isoforms expressed in these tissues are structurally more analogous to the ubiquitously expressed calpains.  This has implications for LGMD2A where a loss of function of Calpain 3 in non-skeletal muscle tissue could be compensated for by the ubiquitous calpains, thus explaining the lack of any non-muscle tissue pathology in LGMD2A patients.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mammalian, Calpain 3, Alternative-splicing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#963;-aryl, carbene and carbyne complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Wright, Leonard James</field><field name="description">Organometallic chemistry is concerned with the study of metal-carbon bonded species. A wide variety of bonding modes have been discovered ranging from simple &#963;- through to more complex &#960;- and &#956;-interactions. This thesis deals with the synthesis and chemistry of just three classes of compound, those containing formal TM-C single, double and triple bonds. These species are normally referred to as transition metal alkyl (&#963;-aryl), carbene and carbyne complexes respectively. The material is divided into five chapters and each is introduced by a relevant review. In chapter 1 the syntheses of &#963;-alkyl and -aryl complexes of ruthenium and osmium are described. These species are produced from organomercury reagents either by oxidative addition to the zerovalent complex Ru(CO)&#8322;(PPh&#8323;) &#8323; or by reaction with the hydrido complexes MClH(CO)(PPh&#8323;) &#8323; (M = Ru, Os). This latter reaction provides a new route to organotransition metal complexes and some possible mechanisms are discussed. The organo-complexes formed by this latter method are coordinatively unsaturated and the structure of RuCl(p-tolyl)(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; has been obtained by X-ray crystallography. The migratory insertion and reductive elimination reactions of these new compounds are discussed in chapters 2 and 3. Predictably, the Lewis base CO rapidly adds to these 16 electron species and the expected octahedral derivatives are formed. In some cases these are in equilibrium in solution with the corresponding dihapto-acyl complexes. The positions of the equilibria, the rates of interconversion and the relative solubilities of the two forms are such that in each case either essentially pure dicarbonyl or essentially pure dihapto-acyl can be isolated from solution. The dihapto-mode of bonding has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography for two of the derivatives. CNp-tolyl also adds to the 16 electron organo-compounds in an analogous fashion and equilibrium with the corresponding dihapto-iminoacyl compounds is attained in some cases. The dihapto-iminoacyl formulation has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Factors affecting the positions of all these equilibria are discussed and the possible relevance of these dihapto-acyl and -iminoacyl complexes as models for the proposed intermediates in the CO and CNR insertion reactions is noted. Compounds containing cis-H,R ligands are rarely stable since reductive elimination of R-H usually occurs very readily. Species of this type, therefore, appear to be ideal precursors for reactive, low valent complexes which are unobtainable by other means. A synthetic route has been developed by which an hydrido ligand can be incorporated into the coordination sphere of the new organo-derivatives described in chapter 1. The key step involves the thermal decarboxylation of a dihapto-formate ligand. In this way remarkably stable cis-H, tolyl complexes of osmium have been prepared. Toluene is eliminated from these derivatives only under forcing conditions. In contrast, reductive elimination from the analogous ruthenium complexes proceeds much more rapidly and in only one case has a stable hydrido, aryl complex been isolated. Other compounds that have been formed by this route are the zerovalent complex Ru(CO)(dppe)&#8322; and the ortho-metallated complex Ru(C6H&#8324;PPh&#8322;)H(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;. Factors affecting the rates of all these reactions are discussed. Some reactions of Ru(C&#8326;H&#8324;PPh&#8322;)H(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; have been investigated, and most notably a methyl, formate complex is produced with formaldehyde and a small amount of a dichlorocarbene complex with CCl&#8324;. The reactions of this ortho-metallated compound may proceed via the intermediate "Ru(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8323;". Extension of the synthetic procedure described in chapter 1 has led to the production of the dichlorocarbene complex OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CCl&#8322;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;, the structure of which has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This compound, which formally contains an Os-Ccarbene double bond, provides the subject matter for chapter 4. The carbene carbon atom is attacked by nucleophiles and the chloride substituents are easily displaced. This species therefore behaves as a remarkably versatile synthetic intermediate. Reaction with the chalcogen hydrides HX&#8315; (or H&#8322;X) leads to the corresponding chalcocarbonyl derivatives and OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CTe)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; is the first tellurocarbonyl complex to be isolated. Characterization of this complex includes an X-ray crystallographic analysis. Primary mines react with OsCl&#8322; (CO)(CCl&#8322;)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; to form the corresponding coordinated isocyanides and reactions with other nucleophiles are also discussed. The most important of these, however, is the reaction with Li(p-tolyl). This produces the monomeric carbyne complex, Os(Cp-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;, the structure of which has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This compound has an extremely short Os-Ccarbyne bond length and this is consistent with a triple bond formulation. The synthesis and chemistry of this compound is discussed in chapter 5. Although other carbyne complexes have been isolated previously this is a relatively new area of organometallic chemistry and reports of the chemistry of these species are restricted mainly to compounds of the GpVIa and VIIa metals. Os(Cp-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; displays a rather different chemistry from these compounds and some new reactions have been observed. Electrophiles such as H&#8330; and Cl&#8322; readily attack Ccarbyne and the corresponding carbene complexes are formed. This suggests that Ccarbyne is nucleophilic. The elements S, Se and Te add to the Os-Ccarbyne triple bond under ambient conditions to give the corresponding dihapto-chalcoacyl complexes. Adducts of the Os-Ccarbyne triple bond are also formed with the GpIb metals and the structure of Os(C{p-tolyl}AgCl)Cl(CO)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322; has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Analogues of all these reactions are to be found in acetylene chemistry. In contrast to the cationic carbyne complexes of the GpVIa and VIIa metals, Ccarbyne in [Os(Cp-tolyl)(CO)&#8322; (PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; is not attacked by nucleophiles. Instead LiBHEt&#8323; preferentially attacks the para-carbon atom of the Ccarbyne p-tolyl substituent and an Os(O) vinylidene complex is formed. The structure of this compound has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Although the aromatic ring is destroyed in this reaction it is replaced by an extensively conjugated system which reaches through to the osmium atom. Further reactions of this species and the cationic carbyne complex [Os(Cp-tolyl)(CO)(CNp-tolyl)(PPh&#8323;)&#8322;]ClO&#8324; are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Towards the Crisamicins</field><field name="creator">Lai, Michelle Yu Huay</field><field name="description">This thesis describes synthetic work directed towards the synthesis of the dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone antibiotic crisamicin A 1.46 and its regioisomer 2.77. The synthetic strategy adopted is based on a double furofuran annulation/oxidative rearrangement strategy that has been successfully used by this research group to prepare a related dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone based on the actinorhodin skeleton. The retrosynthesis that was adopted (see Scheme 1.47, page 59) required the initial preparation of a key bis-naphthoquinone 1.267 which in turn is available from bisnaphthalene 1.268 that bears acetyl groups at C-7 and C-7&#8217;. Initial work concentrated on the construction of the biaryl linkage of bis-7- acetylnaphthalene 1.268 using a palladium(0)-mediated Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the key triflate 1.269 (prepared in 10 steps from vanillin 1.271) using bis(pinacolato)diboron 1.179. This coupling method successfully afforded binaphthyls 2.8b and 2.8d which were subjected to attempts to effect either double bromination, double acetylation or double Fries rearrangement to a more functionalised biaryl system. Disappointingly, none of these methods allowed introduction of the key acetyl group at C-7 and C-7&#8217; onto the initial biaryls 2.8b and 2.8d. Attention then turned to the synthesis of the bis-7-acetylnaphthalene 1,268 that was required for the ensuing furofuran annulation reaction starting from triflate 2.7 that already contained an acetyl group at C-7, then effecting formation of the key biaryl linkage. Attempts to prepare 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 via either Fries rearrangement of acetates 2.33a or 2.9a, or via bromination of acetate 2.33a, naphthol 2.56 or benzyl ether 2.6 were unsuccessful. An alternative approach for the preparation of 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 involved the preparation of 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74 from carbamate 2.64 via a directed ortho-metalation, followed by reaction of the derived ortho-lithiated species with N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide 2.71. However, this strategy resulted only in low yields of the desired 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74, although initial model work did provide methodology for the successful conversion of carbamate 2.68 to 2-acetyl-l-naphthol 2.73. The synthetic target of this thesis shifted to the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 when attempts to introduce an acetyl group atC-7 of triflate 2.9 failed. However formation of the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b was successful from triflate 2.9b. A subsequent one-pot in situ Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of triflate 2.81b with boronate 2.89 furnished dimmer 2.76b. Oxidation of dimer 2.76b to bis-naphthoquinone 2.80 was then accomplished using silver(II) oxide and 6 M nitric acid. With the key bis-6-acetylnaphthoquinone 2.80 in hand, an efficient double furofuran annulation reaction was carried out using 2-trimethylsilyloxyfuran 1.88 affording the desired bis-furonaphthofuran adduct 2.79 as an inseparable l:l mixture of diastereomers 2.79a and 2.79b. However, initial experiments to effect the double oxidative rearrangement of bis-furonaphthofuran adducts 2.79 using either silver(Il) oxide and 6 M nitric acid or with ceric ammonium nitrate in aqueous acetonitrile to the bisfuronaphthopyran 2.7 8 were unsuccessful. Attention then turned to the preparation of bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78 from the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b via initial oxidation of triflate 2.81b to naphthoquinone 3.3 followed by furofuran annulation and then oxidative rearrangement. Attempts to effect the key Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of furonaphthofuran 3.2 to bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79, or of furonaphthopyran 3.1 to bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78, using catalyst PdCl2(dppf) and ligand dppf were unsuccessful. The work achieved herein constitutes the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for the synthesis of the crisamicin analogue 2.79. The final synthesis of the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 can be completed by preparing bis-furonaphthopyran bis-lactol 2.78 using more powerful palladium(0) catalysts and ligands for the Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the monomeric furonaphthopyran 3.1. Subsequent reduction af 2.78 using triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid will then afford the bis-cyclic ether 3.15, which can undergo deprotection of the methyl ether and epimerisation at C-5 upon treatment with excess boron tribromide to finally furnish the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77. An investigation into the double oxidative rearangement of bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79 to the bis-lactol 2.78 could also be carried out by the use of several alternative oxidising agents, such as phenyliodine(III) bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA), phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA), polymer-supported (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (PSDIB), Fremy's salt, iron trichloride or CrO3.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in ionogram analysis and interpretation</field><field name="creator">Lobb, R.

The general principles are described in detail and the procedure is applied to the valley problem in bottomside ionogram analysis. It is shown that only a single parameter, the integrated valley ionisation, is obtainable from typical ionograms. The least-squares technique is then applied to the problem of topside ionogram analysis where the facility for using any mixture of ordinary and extraordinary ray virtual depth data is very useful. The method is shown to offer many advantages over the more traditional methods. The effects of horizontal ionisation gradients on bottomside and topside ionograms are extensively investigated by a new technique for synthesising ionograms corresponding to a given model of a moving disturbance in the ionosphere. A number of interesting and important ionogram characteristics are identified and explained. Finally, the specific problem of a large disturbance seen on total electron content records during summer nights is briefly re-examined using topside ionogram data. It is suggested that the disturbance is not primarily a topside phenomenon as originally supposed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291710 Radio communications and broadcasting not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Metabolism of Plant Cells in Tissue Culture</field><field name="creator">Bellamy, A.

This system was used to study methods of purifying nucleic acids, phosphate ester and nucleic acid metabolism in cells subjected to nutritional shifts, and problems relating to the control of cell division in plant cells. 2.	Cell cultures consisting of single cells, groups of cells and small aggregates were maintained in liquid medium on rotary shakers. Cultures exhibited an exponential growth period during which the cell generation time was 2, 3 days. 3.	Cells removed from culture medium and resuspended in dilute inorganic salt solutions (step-down nutritional shift) exhibited marked changes in their phosphate and sulphate accumulation rates and in phosphate ester metabolism, but not in the type and rate of respiration. 4.	Such metabolic responses to culture shifts were not related to cell damage or shock effects, but appeared to be a feature of changes in the nutritional environment of cells. The response of cells to a step-down nutritional shift was maximal at exponential- and late-stationary phases of culture growth. Step-up nutritional shifts (resuspending cells in enriched culture medium) produced some effects similar to those found for step-down cells. Actinomycin D did not prevent the phosphate accumulation response of cells to culture shifts, and was shown to inhibit only 50 per cent of the synthesis of rapidly-labelled ribonucleic acid. 5.	RNA prepared from tobacco cells or rat liver by conventional phenol extraction was contaminated with other materials which composed as much as sixty per cent of the weight of the total preparation. RNA prepared from (32P) tobacco cells contained minor radioactivity in RNA but major radioactivity in a wide range of contaminating phosphate esters of high specific radioactivity. 6.	Purification of RNA by the Kirby two-phase partition procedure removed most major contaminants but failed to remove (32P) phosphate esters. The procedure also resulted in degraded RNA. 7.	A new method was developed for the purification of RNA prepared by the phenol procedure. It involved recovery of RNA from the upper phase of the two-phase Kirby extraction mixture by precipitation as the cetyltrimethylammonium (CETA) salt instead of by dialysis.  This procedure reduced manipulation times and much more effectively removed RNAase and (32P) phosphate esters from the RNA. 8.	TMV-RNA prepared by the new procedure was fully infectious. RNA prepared and purified from a mixture of whole rat liver and TMV was almost equally as infectious as RNA prepared from TMV alone. Infectivity of purified RNA, prepared from a mixture of tobacco cells and TMV, was stable in solution at 30&#176;C for four hours. TMV-RNA prepared in this way and stored at -12&#176;C in vacuo over P2O5 retained infectivity for at least 6 months. 9.	Extraction of (32P) exponential-phase cells by aqueous phenol plus detergent released only RNA with the ribosomal type of base composition. Similar extractions in the presence of high salt concentrations released this RNA together with DNA and rapidly-labelled RNA. 10.	During short treatments with (32P) orthophosphate, exponential-phase cells synthesised RNA with a base composition intermediate between that of ribosomal RNA and DNA. Cells subjected to a step-down nutritional shift prior to treatment with (32P) orthophosphate, synthesised RNA with a base composition close to that of tobacco DNA. 11.	Following treatment times with (32P orthophosphate, or (32P) plus (3H) uridine, and following a step-down or steady-state nutritional shift to non-radioactive medium, tobacco cells exhibited the following changes in phosphate ester and RNA metabolism:- a.	Changes in the levels of radioactivity present in the nucleoside triphosphate RNA precursors and other phosphate esters. b.	A reduction in the rate of increase of specific radioactivity of RNA of step-down cells, followed by a subsequent recovery. c.	Changes in the (32P) base composition of the RNA synthesised following the culture shift. d.	Changes in the radioactive sedimentation profiles of RNA. 12.	Extracts prepared from exponential-phase tobacco cells contained cytokinin (cell division stimulant) activity. Fractionation of cells, and bioassay of levels of cytokinins present in the various fractions, demonstrated the presence of soluble compounds with cytokinin activity in cell debris and cytoplasmic fractions, but not in the nuclear fraction. 13.	Unhydrolysed (polymeric) tobacco nucleic acids (RNA plus DNA), prepared from exponential-phase tobacco cells, showed no cytokinin activity. A ribonucleotide mixture prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of these tobacco-cell nucleic acid preparations, mixtures of purified ribonucleotides, or a mixture of tobacco deoxyribo- and ribonucleosides resulting from snake-venom digestion, contained no activity. Deoxyribonucleotides were inhibitory. 14.	A ribonucleotide mixture prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of RNA isolated from rat liver and sheep liver, contained cytokinin activity. Deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside mixtures resulting from snake-venom digestion of sheep-liver RNA and DNA contained similar levels of cytokinin activity to that found in extracts prepared by alkaline hydrolysis.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dehydrochlorination of 1,1-diaryl-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in protic and dipolar aprotic solvents</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ronald James</field><field name="description">PART I A general introduction is given to the mechanisms of olefin-forming &#946;-elimination. The development of mechanistic criteria and their application to the various reactions is discussed. Conflicting theories concerning the nature of the transition states of E2H reactions in protic solvents as well as the Winstein-Parker E2C-like transitions states for elimination by weak bases in dipolar aprotic solvents are described. PART II The use of primary deuterium isotope effects: structure-reactivity relationships, and rate-acidity correlations as mechanistic criteria for the E2 mechanism and the variants of the E1cB mechanism is reviewed. These criteria have been applied to the dehydrochlorination of the 1,1-diaryl-2, 2, 2-trichloroethanes (DDT-type compounds) with methoxide-methanol and t-butoxide-t-butanol. Literature comparisons indicate that the kinetic evidence for these two systems is in accord with an "irreversible" E1cB elimination pathway. PART III Characteristics of weak base-promoted eliminations in dipolar aprotic advents are reviewed. The evidence is not entirely consistent with either E2C or the E2H mechanism. Deuterium isotope effects and equilibrium constants are reported for the chloride ion-promoted elimination of the 1, 1-diary1-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in dimethylformamide and acetone respectively.

Chapter 1 comprises: a review of Vaska's compound, IrCl(CO) (PPh3)2 and related species, covering syntheses, structure and bonding and reactions of this very widely studied moiety; and brief reviews of metal-thiocarbonyl syntheses and reactions and metal-selenocarbonyl chemistry. These three reviews background the themes developed in this work; of preparations and reactions, particularly ligand reactions, of thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl analogues of Vaska's compound and species derived from IrCl(CE)(PPh3)2, E = S, Se. A new synthesis of IrCl(CS)(PPh3)2 is described in Chapter 2. The route employed involves preparation of dithioester complexes and facets of the reactivity of these species have been considered and a number of metallocycle derivatives prepared. Reductions of coordinated-thiocarbonyl groups have been considered; IrH(CS)(PPh3)3 was transformed into IrH2(SMe)(PPh3)3 by treatment with hydrogen, while the thiocarbonyl cation complexes [IrClX(CO)(CS)-(PPh3)2]+ were treated with borohydride to afford thioformyl species. Iridium alkyl, thiocarbonyl complexes have been prepared, and transformed by reaction with dithiocarbamate ion to yield monohapto-thioacetyl derivatives. The preparation of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2, the selenocarbonyl analogue of Vaska's compound is reported in Chapter 3. The synthesis utilizes carbon diselenide as the selenocarbonyl source, and involves a four-step conversion of a dihapto-carbon diselenide adduct complex to the iridium(I) selenocarbonyl species. Reactions of a range of iridium(I) complexes with carbon diselenide are described, including the preparation of a complex including three CSe2 groups. Reactions of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 have been studied and several iridium(I) and (III) selenocarbonyl compounds prepared. The ready reduction of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 (in the presence of phosphine) by borohydride to give IrH2(SeMe)(PPh3)3 is described and comparisons are drawn between the relative reactivities of iridium thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl groups, in analogous species, with nucleophiles. It is concluded the Ir-CSe system is more reactive under similar conditions.

Both of these isomers were obtained from the methoxyalkene (11), which was isolated in a pure form during selective epoxidation of the methoxyalkene mixture (11 - 13) obtained from the decarboxylation of 12-methoxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (2) with lead tetraacetate. This reaction has been investigated, and a mechanism accounting for the formation of nondecarboxylation products is proposed. The unsaturated ketoester (102) was prepared in low yield via the saturated C12 ketone (24), obtained from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (1) by Birch reduction of the aromatic ring. A number of ring A epoxide derivatives of the acid(1) were prepared and cleaved by a variety of reagents to give the 3-oxygenated derivatives (145), (146), and (152), together with compounds possessing a contracted ring A. Some ring B lactone derivatives of the acid (1) were prepared, and their stereochemistry and conformation were determined by n.m.r. spectroscopy. The conformation of some ring B-substituted derivatives was also determined by n.m.r. methods. The bromination of some 7-ketopodocarpa-8,11,13-triene derivatives was investigated, and reasons are advanced for the non-stereospecific reactions observed in some cases.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrological variation in the Banks Islands, New Hebrides</field><field name="creator">Barsdell, Mark</field><field name="description">The Banks Islands represent the most northern group of volcanic islands in the linear Central Chain of Pliocene - Recent age in the New Hebrides. A study o f the petrological variation in these northern islands provides a basis for the development of a petrogenetic-tectonic model which is applicable to most, if not all, the Central Chain islands. Integration of petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data on each island in the Banks Group has revealed a systematic petrological variation across the islands, represented chemically by a decrease in K20 (and related incompatible elements) away from the New Hebrides trench. The correlation with depth to the Benioff zone is therefore the reverse of that typically found in island arcs. REE evidence and source modelling based on this data indicates that this variation represents a progressive depletion in LREE/HREE in the upper mantle, laterally away from the trench. The variation also represents a progressive increase in partial melting of the source, in the same direction. However partial melting differences alone could not produce the observed variation. The variation in source composition and degree of partial melting are blended in to a model in which the compositional variation is attributed to an earlier west-facing Miocene subduction event, and the variation in degree of partial melting is a function of the location of the islands with respect to the postulated heat source: the active back-arc basin. The enrichment of the upper mantle in the Miocene is ascribed to the ascent of hydrous fluids enriched in incompatible elements, from the west-dipping Benioff zone, and subsequent reaction with the overlying upper mantle. The model thus envisages approximately contemporaneous development of the Central Chain volcanoes and the back-arc basin in the late Pliocene, with partial melting of hydrous, laterally zoned upper mantle resulting from the convective thermal regime associated with the rifting apart of the back-arc basin. The role of the present subduction regime in magma generation is considered very limited. The mineralogical and geochemical data show that all compositions in the range from basaltic andesite to dacite (ie. &gt; 53wt.% SiO2) in the Banks Islands can be derived from basalts by fractional crystallization of the observed phenocryst phases (including magnetite in the Gaua suite), after allowances have been made for inherited differences between some melt fractions. Together with the paucity of andesites in the Central Chain, this suggests that the primary melts of the Pliocene - Recent volcanism are basaltic. The generation of calc-alkaline magmas in the early Miocene are also believed to have involved basaltic primary melts as both the Miocene Eastern and Western belts are dominantly basaltic.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chain (re)alignment in New Zealand&#8217;s sheep meat and dairy industries : knowledge, networks and learning at the farmer-processor site</field><field name="creator">Penny, G. M.</field><field name="description">Emerging from the agricultural crisis of the 1988s, producers and processing companies in New Zealand's sheep meat and dairy industries, found themselves in an evolving neo-liberalised environment. By the late 1990s major structural (re) alignment had taken place in production and processing to accommodate shifts in markets and regulation, centring on 'food safety', 'quality' and "availability" For both farmers and processing company staff, this meant venturing into unfamiliar jointly occupied spaces and unchartered relational territory, Through a participatory research approach using multiple methodologies, this thesis examines supply chain (re)alignment at a macro and micro-scale, focussing on the farmer-processor relationship and knowledge, network and learning processes of farmers in (global) lamb and dairy supply chains in New Zealand. In seeking to account for evolving agri-food chain relations at multiple scales, this research turns to the global commodity chains (GCC) literature and draws on pragmatic solution-oriented ideas emerging from the developing field of Supply Chain Management (SCM). It also includes theoretical input from the cognitive and behavioural sciences to interpret the empirical data on farmer's knowledge, networks and learning in different supply chains, which it argues are key features of globalising agri-food economies. In this research these literatures and theories are enveloped by a broader yet, incomplete, theoretical foundation - that of evolutionary political economy (EPE), which is extended in this thesis, The thesis argues that an EPE framework provides a useful window on the governance of New Zealand's relations at a distance because it allows the specificity of micro-scale coordination activities and relations (in jointly occupied spaces) in New Zealand to be embedded in local and macro scale governance regimes and historical development processes. The findings show global market and regulatory pressures continue to drive supply chain (re)alignment in New Zealand, and chain building is occurring in different ways at the farmer-processor interface, between and within the different industries. Farmers' place specific on-farm knowledge co-evolves with off-farm knowledge through a combination of concrete experience, trial and error, socialisation and reflection, with both on and off farm knowledge becoming more overt in practice and strategy as supply chain specifications becomes more precise. Farmers utilise a range of networks (informal, formal, specialist and general), which serve as both information channels and learning forums. New Zealand's agricultural industries are like many in competitive globalising economies -'new' know ledge is being generated and used to broker global and local social, economic and environmental contexts and values, and in the process, supply chain partners' capacities and relations evolve.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of diterpenoids in synthesis</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Brian D.</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis describes the use of several diterpenoids which are readily available in New Zealand for the synthesis of compounds possessing ambergris-type odours.

Evaluation was made in three ways: 1) Observation of large-scale geographic variation in nitrogen status in natural populations around New Zealand in summer and winter, 2) Laboratory-based experimental assessment of the biochemical responses of N-indices in Ulva to nitrogen enrichment, and 3) Culturing standardized test-Ulva under low nutrient conditions which could be deployed into a variety of field situations. Seawater inorganic nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and phosphate) concentrations and nitrogen (N)-indices (free amino acids, chlorophyll and total tissue nitrogen) in natural Ulva populations from 32 sites around New Zealand were compared. Sites were divided into 6 environmental categories: sheltered rural, exposed rural, rock pools, sheltered urban, exposed urban, and nitrogen-enriched urban sites. Seawater nutrient concentrations were highly variable between all sites in summer and winter. However, in the summer enriched urban sites had the highest mean total inorganic nitrogen concentrations and Ulva with the highest mean levels of all N-indices compared with any other environmental category. In the winter, Ulva contained more nitrogen (reflected in all N-indices) compared with Ulva in the summer, particularly in populations growing in colder southern seawater on more exposed coasts. The increase in Ulva N-status was not explained by increased seawater inorganic nitrogen concentrations. With univariate and multivariate statistical approaches it was shown that there was a significant effect of seawater temperature and site exposure on N-status in Ulva. Compared with other N-indices, stable nitrogen isotopes (&#948;15N) from Ulva growing in enriched urban sites had the widest range (4.77 &#177; 0.04 &#8240; to 15.16 &#177; 0.03 &#8240;) of values compared with all other categories in both summer and winter. Conversely, Ulva from exposed rural sites had the lowest range of &#948;15N values compared with any other category (6.7 &#177; 0.1 to 8.8 &#177; 0.1 &#8240;) and showed no seasonal change in mean values (7.8 &#8240; and 7.6 &#8240; for summer and winter, respectively). In addition, &#948;15N values in Ulva were the only N-index that showed a significant difference between urban and rural categories. To test the relationship between inorganic nitrogen concentration in seawater and the responses of biochemical nitrogen indices in Ulva pertusa, several experiments were conducted in an outdoor, flow-through culture apparatus, in summer and winter. In this apparatus effects of ammonium concentration, nitrogen source (nitrate and ammonium), light and seawater motion were investigated. Of the same three N-indices examined in natural Ulva populations (free amino acids, chlorophyll and total tissue nitrogen), increases in free amino acids, particularly asparagine, provided the strongest indicator of increases in nitrogen availability. In addition, while tissue nitrogen and chlorophyll also increased with seawater nitrogen concentration, it was apparent that these indices were also strongly influenced by light, and probably season. Rates of ammonium assimilation provided no overall measure of the availability of nitrogen in seawater and were clearly affected by season. Similarly, growth rates in Ulva only showed a response to nitrogen addition in summer months. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (&#948;15N) in Ulva provided a clear distinction between natural and synthetic nitrogen sources, but more importantly, showed only minor fractionation (ranging from 1.3 &#8240; to -1.9 &#8240;) of 15N supplied from synthetic nitrate and ammonium under both light-saturating and light-limiting conditions. To further develop Ulva as a standardized test-organism it was cultured in low-nutrient (non-polluted) seawater to deplete internal storage pools of nitrogen. Each month the resulting test-Ulva was then placed in surface-moored growth enclosures at a range of coastal sites around Auckland and then monitored for one year. In winter there were increases in seawater inorganic nitrogen concentrations and concomitant increases in free amino acid content. However, tissue nitrogen and chlorophyll content in test-Ulva showed similar increases (possibly saturating) across all sites suggesting that seasonal increases in these N-indices were also due to other seasonal factors (e.g., surface irradiance and / or seawater temperature). On the other hand, the total free amino acid pool showed strong differences between a low-nitrogen reference site and the other study sites all year round. It was probable that test-Ulva was integrating differences in tidally-averaged nitrogen loading that were not reliably detected in instantaneous seawater samples. In addition to N-indices in test-Ulva, levels of tissue heavy metals and stable isotopes of nitrogen showed strong differences with higher values of both typically found in urban environments compared with values found in non-polluted reference sites. It is concluded that several abiotic and biotic factors affect nitrogen status in Ulva, but the average nitrogen concentration in seawater, and the physical factors of temperature, light and water motion, appear to be the overarching determinants. It is further suggested that in combination with Ulva tissue &#948;15N values, tissue nitrogen and the free amino acid pool, as quantitative biochemical measures of nitrogen availability, are likely to provide useful information on both the amount and composition of nitrogen entering coastal environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ulva</field><field name="subject">algae</field><field name="subject">seaweed</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">eutrophication</field><field name="subject">seawater nitrogen enrichment</field><field name="subject">nitrogen metabolism</field><field name="subject">biological indicator</field><field name="subject">free amino acids</field><field name="subject">tissue nitrogen</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll</field><field name="subject">isotope d15N</field><field name="subject">seawater temperature</field><field name="subject">water motion</field><field name="subject">marine pollution</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of copper systems interacting with molecular oxygen</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the chemical, physico-chemical and structural studies of two types of copper compounds which interact with molecular oxygen in their formation. The first type is an intensely coloured species based on the ligand oxalyldihydrazide. The divalent metal and the ligand react together with simple carbonyl compounds and molecular oxygen in basic conditions to form blue species the nature of which has been the subject of conjecture for many years. This work shows that the metal is trivalent in the highly coloured states and that it acts as an oxidative catalyst with ascorbic acid. The copper (III)/copper (II) potential has been established as +0.244V by polarography. Compounds including acetaldehyde and acetone as the carbonyl component have been crystallized in monoclinic space groups. In both instances X-ray diffraction studies show that the metal is co-ordinated to a 6-5-6-5 macrocycle formed by a condensation reaction between two oxalyldihydrazide molecules and two carbonyl moieties. The co-ordination is via four deprotonated 'amide' nitrogen atoms and is of square-planar geometry. A structural study of oxalyldihydrazide has also been undertaken and comparisons are made with the co-ordinated species. The second type of compound studied is a Cu4OX6L4 cluster. It was made from a copper(I) precursor and studies with oxygen-18 gas show that formation requires oxidation to copper(II) followed by hydrolysis. Infrared evidence based on the Cu-O stretch (500-580 cm-1) is presented. Attempts to include both fluorine and iodine as the halogen component suggest that only chlorine and bromine may fill such a role.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the reduction of formaldehyde emission from particleboard by polymers</field><field name="creator">Kazakevics, Arnis Aris Rolands.</field><field name="description">Formaldehyde is an important industrial chemical due to its unique properties, coupled with its low cost and the basic availability of the raw materials from which it is produced. It is generated principally by the catalytic oxidation of methanol using a heated stationary catalyst at approximately atmospheric pressure. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, the most significant of which in New Zealand, are the urea-formaldehyde resins. Such resins are used in the production of reconstituted wood products such as: particleboard; medium density fibreboard; plywood; laminated and finger jointed wood products; and in the modification of textiles and papers. Insulating building foams have also been formulated using urea-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde release from products containing urea-formaldehyde adhesives has been well documented in the literature over recent years. It has been shown that in some instances the levels of airborne formaldehyde inside dwellings and commercial premises may exceed various industrial threshold limit values for an eight hour working day. In New Zealand the current industrial permissible time weighted average value for formaldehyde in air is set at a maximum level of 2 ppm (2.4 mg of formaldehyde per metre3 of air). Natural levels of formaldehyde in air do exist and have been measured as being in the vicinity of 0.12 to 0.39 parts per billion. In terms of being a health hazard, formaldehyde was found to be a primary irritant of the respiratory airways and a skin sensitizer in some individuals. Some suggestion has been made that formaldehyde can also be carcinogenic. This suggestion should be treated with caution as it derives from preliminary experiments on rats and mice exposed to very high formaldehyde levels. Over the years a variety of test methods have been applied to the measurement of formaldehyde which is released from formaldehyde-bearing materials. A dynamic testing method, in the form of a wind-tunnel was adopted in this study for measuring the emission rate of formaldehyde directly from the surfaces of urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard. Emissions were quantified in terms of the weight of formaldehyde emitted in mg from one square metre of panel surface over one hour, under the prevailing climatic conditions. It was observed that formaldehyde emissions were as great as about 12 mg h-1 m-2 from panels tested soon after manufacture. After five years of storage of the particleboard panels in ventilated conditions, the formaldehyde emission rates were measured as being between 0.1 and 1.1 mg h-1 m-2. It was apparent that formaldehyde emissions from particleboard bonded with a urea-formaldehyde resin with a urea to formaldehyde molar ratio of 1 to 1.5, reached a basal level approximately 12 months from the time of manufacture. The formaldehyde emitted over the initial 12 month period was equated to the formaldehyde which was originally present dissolved in the resin solution and the formaldehyde which was cleaved from the urea-formaldehyde polymer network during high temperature pressing. Formaldehyde lost from the particleboard after the initial 12 month storage phase was probably due to hydrolysis of the resin under ambient conditions. The latter was termed "evaporable" formaldehyde as opposed to "free" formaldehyde which was emitted in the first 12 month period. The fluctuations in the basal emission rates of formaldehyde from particleboard were attributed to changes in the microclimate associated with the particleboard. Particleboard panels with a higher density surface layer of wood tended to have higher formaldehyde emission rates in the early period of storage compared with particleboard having a lower density of wood in the surface layer. Emissions of formaldehyde from the edges of freshly sawn particleboard tended to be as much as 30 to 60 times greater than emissions from the faces of the original panels. After extended storage, emissions from the edges of particleboard tended to approximate the levels of emissions from the faces of particleboard. It was demonstrated that the presence of an air boundary layer adjacent to the particleboard surface has a significant effect on the formaldehyde emission rate from the panel surface. Below air speeds of 5 cm s-1 over the panel surface, it appeared that the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde through the air boundary layer controlled the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde from the particleboard surface into the bulk air. At air velocities in excess of 5 am s-1 the effect of the air boundary layer diminished. It was estimated that within enclosed spaces, such as houses with a relatively low air-turnover rate, the diffusive resistance of air boundary layers to formaldehyde emissions from particleboard surfaces could be significant in lowering the formaldehyde levels inside the house. The use of paints, paint-coated wallpaper and polymer-coated wallpaper to cover particleboard surfaces tended to reduce the emission rate of formaldehyde to below the detection threshold of the method of measurement (0.01 mg h-1 m-2). Some building materials other than urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard were shown to emit measureable quantities of formaldehyde. These materials were of cellulosic-origin and emitted as much as 0.3 mg of formaldehyde h-1 m-2. The latter were known to not contain urea-fonnal6ehyde bonding agents. The levels of formaldehyde inside a showhome containing urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard as wall and floor cladding were measured as ranging from 1.2 to 7.2 mg m-3, but these air-borne concentrations of formaldehyde decreased to between 0.7 and 1.3 mg m-3. after an interval of three months. A mathematical model was derived for the prediction of the maximum expected steady state levels of formaldehyde inside dwellings containing formaldehyde-emitting materials. The model took into account such parameters as: the emission rate of formaldehyde from the emitting surface; the surface area of the exposed emitting material; and the volumetric air flow rate through the dwelling. The model in general tended to indicate higher formaldehyde levels when tested using the parameters derived from measurements taken in the showhome. This model could conceivably find use in the design of buildings in order to minimize the levels of formaldehyde in the indoor environment. The lack of sufficient information in the literature relating to the mass transfer of formaldehyde through polymers prompted the investigation into the permeability characteristics of polymeric materials to formaldehyde. The steady state transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polymer films, such as plastic films, free paint and free polyurethane varnish coatings, were measured using a diffusion cell operated at atmospheric pressure. The mass diffusion principle associated with this permeation testing device best paralleled the real-life situation where either polymer films (plastic films) or polymer coatings (paint or varnish coatings) may be in contact with formaldehyde and water vapour, at atmospheric pressure. As a source of penetrant in these studies a dilute aqueous solution of formaldehyde was used to yield molecular formaldehyde. It was calculated that an aqueous solution containing 69 mg L-1 of formaldehyde gave rise to a concentration in air of formaldehyde, above the solution, of 1 mg m-3 at 30&#176;C. A solution with such a concentration of dissolved formaldehyde was chosen arbitrarily for permeation studies. Levels of air-borne formaldehyde inside enclosed airspaces such as in houses lined with urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard, with a low air turn-over, could reasonably be expected to be in the region of 0.1 to 100 mg m-3. The use of carbon-14 formaldehyde was favoured in this research over the use of carbon-12 formaldehyde. This gave rise to the possibility of permeability isotope effects. Based on the information presented in this thesis and on the experimental variability in test results, it appeared that the effects of a permeability isotope effect were negligible in comparison. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the following types of polymer films were measured: low density polyethylene; high density polyethylene; high density-low density polyethylene blended polymer; polypropylene; poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); poly(viny1idene dichloride)-coated Poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); "Paraform", a multi-layered food packaging polymer film based on cellophane; Poly(ethylene vinyl acetate), a multi-layered food packaging polymer film; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; nylon-6; and cellophane. At 30&#176;C transmission rates of formaldehyde ranged from 1.2 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for cellophane to 1.2 x 10-l2 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) polymer films, respectively. There was some indication that the transmission rate of formaldehyde through low density polyethylene decreased with increasing film thickness. It also appeared that an increase in the water contents of nylon-6 and cellophane films lead to an increase in the transmission rate of formaldehyde. With the exception of the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of polymer films and the polystyrene film, all other polymer film types exhibited typical Fickian behaviour, in that the permeation of formaldehyde through each polymer film was steady state. The permeation of formaldehyde through poly (ethylene terephtha1ate)-type films and polystyrene film appeared to be anomalous in that the mass transfer process did not appear to show Fickian-type behaviour. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films, free vinyl-based paint films and through free polyurethane varnish films, were measured at 30&#176;C. The permeation of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films and free polyurethane varnish films typified Fickian behaviour, in that after a short time-lag the steady state permeation of formaldehyde occurred. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the free alkyd-types of paint film ranged from 1.8 x 10-9 &#956;g cm-1s-1 to 3 2 x l0-9 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 whereas transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polyurethane varnish films ranged from 4.1 x 10-10 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 2.4 x 10-8 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. It appeared that the "two-pack" or "catalytic-curing" type of polyurethane varnish film had a lower permeability to formaldehyde compared with either "one-pack" ("air-curing") or "one-pack" ("moisture-curing") varieties of polyurethane varnish. By contrast the transmission rates of formaldehyde through the vinyl-based types of paint films tended to range from 3.7 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 6.2 x10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. A study of the temperature dependency of the permeation of formaldehyde through the following polymer film types was made: low density polyethylene; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; polypropylene; high density polyethylene; cellophane; and nylon-6. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through each of these polymer film types increased with increasing temperature, over the temperature range of 30&#176;C to 50&#176;C, thus typifying Arrhenius behaviour. The energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde were calculated as ranging from 16 1 kcal mol-1 (67.4 kJ mol-1) for plasticised poly (vinyl chloride) to 33.1 kcal mol-1 (139 kJ mol-1 for cellophane, respectively. These activation energies were in general higher than the energies of activation for the permeation of other penetrants of similar molecular weight, through the same polymer types. The observed energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde through polymers were indicative of a strong interaction between formaldehyde and the various polymers. Desorption studies of formaldehyde from polymer films tested after permeability measurement, indicated that formaldehyde was irreversibly sorbed either onto or into the following polymer film types: low density polyethylene; poly(ethy1ene vinyl acetate); polypropylene; polystyrene; and plasticised poly(vinyl chloride). Formaldehyde was found to desorb from nylon-6 and cellophane polymer film types, indicating a different type of interaction between formaldehyde and these two polymer film types. The autoradiography of polymer films and free polymer coatings following permeability testing showed that the pattern of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde exhibited by each polymer film type or free polymer coating type, differed according to the type of polymer. Clustering of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde in polymer films containing polyethylene polymers may have been indicative of the formation of formaldehyde-formaldehyde polymers or perhaps could have been due to preferred pathways or sites for the diffusion of formaldehyde through the polymer film. The following types of polymer film tended to show a uniform sorption pattern of formaldehyde: nylon-6; cellophane; "Paraform"; free alkyd paint films; free vinyl-based paint films; and free polyurethane varnish films. The uniform appearance of the sorption pattern of carbon-14 formaldehyde may have been indicative of a higher solubility coefficient of permeation for formaldehyde in the latter polymer types. On the other hand, insufficient carbon-14 formaldehyde was sorbed by the poly(ethylene terephthalatel-type and polystyrene films in order to obtain autoradiographs. Both the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of films and the polystyrene film had a relatively low permeability to formaldehyde and appeared to also have a low solubilizing effect on formaldehyde. The data presented in this thesis are discussed in relation to the practical problem that initiated the study. Sufficient detailed information has been collected to enable informed decisions to be taken over the choice of formaldehyde-emitting materials used in the building and the food packaging industries.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utilisation of cyclopropyl compounds in the synthesis of troponoids</field><field name="creator">Gravatt, Gary Lance</field><field name="description">The fully regio-controlled synthesis of C1a-C12a mono-seco colchicine 133, as well as a number of structurally interesting analogues, has been achieved.

It is therefore important to gain an understanding of the reactivity of these functional groups. The metal-carbon double bond is introduced in Chapter 1 with a literature review and the following two chapters are concerned with the synthesis and properties of a new class of Group VIII metal carbene complexes containing the prototype carbene ligand, =CH2. The synthetic route to the first of these complexes involves a new low-valent osmium complex OsCl(NO) (PPh3)3. The synthesis of this complex from a reformulated complex containing the novel peroxycarbonyl ligand is discussed in Chapter 2, followed by simple reactions including the synthesis of a range of acetylene, allene and heteroallene &#960;-adducts. The reactions establish that OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 reacts as the osmium analogue of IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2. The methylene-ligand synthesis involves the addition of diazomethane to OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 to give the structurally characterised Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. The reaction has been extended to give the first isolable ruthenium and iridium methylene complexes. The reactions of these complexes establish the nucleophilicity of the double bond and two Lewis acid adducts, Os(CH2AuI)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2 and [Os(CH2S(O)O)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2]ClO4, have been structurally characterised. The reaction with CO and isocyanides to form ketene and ketenimine ligands illustrates a different mode of reaction that is interpreted in terms of the non-innocent participation of the nitrosyl ligand. The change from nucleophilicity to electrophilicity of the double bond with a reduction of metal electron density is illustrated by reactions of Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(pph3)2 which implicate [OS(CH2)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2]+ as an intermediate. Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2 is formed by addition of Cl2 to Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. In Chapter 4 a different type of metal-carbon double bond is discussed. The complexes contain the relatively uncommon dichlorocarbene ligand and the synthesis of the first such iridium complex, Ir(CCl2)Cl3(PPh3)2 is described. The utility of the dichlorocarbene ligand in the synthesis of a range of carbene ligands including monochlorocarbene complexes is illustrated. The most useful single reaction of the dichlorocarbene complexes is that forming a metal-carbon triple bond. A review of the literature concerning carbyne complexes is presented in Chapter 5 and the synthesis and reactions of a number of carbyne complexes is discussed in Chapter 6. Like the methylene complexes, the carbyne complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 contain nucleophilic metal-carbon bonds and Os(CHPh)Cl2(CO)(PPh3)2 resulting from HCl addition has been structurally characterised. However, just as the reactivity can be changed with the methylene complexes, the reduction of metal electron density in complexes such as [Os(CR)Cl2 (CNR')(PPh3)2]ClO4 (R = C6H4-4-NMe2, R' = C6H4-4-Me) makes the triple bond electrophilic. Two methods for synthesising these octahedral carbyne complexes are described. One, involving a reaction of complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with oxygen and the formation of another peroxycarbonyl ligand, the other a reaction with iodine to give complexes such as Ru(CPh)ClI2(PPh3)2. Reactions with chlorine by contrast lead to a group of reactive chlorophenyl carbene complexes. Where appropriate, the reactivity of the complexes described is interpreted in terms of frontier-orbital and charge controlled reactions using the current models for the carbene and carbyne complexes.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The calculation of cloud parameters from AVHRR data</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Roy Gordon</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the electromagnetic radiation that is reflected from and emitted by a clear or cloudy terrestrial atmosphere. Calculations are performed in order to estimate the radiation exitant to space in the visible, the near visible, and the two infrared windows at approximately 4 &#956;m and 11 &#956;m. The NOAA-9 satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/2) is used as the data acquisition system. The satellite AVHRR system is described, as well as future TIROSN satellites. The pre-launch calibration of the radiometer is described in some detail. Post-launch calibration is examined using a reflectance difference method. The radiometer gains are shown to have changed by more than 20% from their pre-launch values. A LOWTRAN based atmospheric model suitable for New Zealand is developed to provide cloud free transmission values. Atmospheric scattering is shown to contribute negligibly to visible cloud measurements (for 8-bit radiometer resolution). The Channels 1 to 3 terrestrial reflectance is averaged from more than two years of satellite data. Sea-surface state is examined as a function of windspeed. A method of extracting surface temperature in rugged terrain is developed. Dual temperature measurements at 10.8 and 11.8 &#956;m are used to estimate surface air temperature. The transfer of radiation in a single layer cloud is calculated as a function of cloud thickness, observation/illumination geometry and the effective radius of the cloud drop-distribution. The variation in drop-size is contained in an ensemble of modified-Gamma distributions whose effective radius varies from 1 to 30 &#956;m with a fixed dispersion of 0.25. A technique is established which allows effective cloud radius to be estimated from 3.7 &#956;m AVHRR/2 imagery. The radiation values at 0.65 &#956;m and 11.8 &#956;m are used to correct the 3.7 &#956;m reflectance for variation in cloud thickness and temperature respectively. The procedure is limited to warm clouds of moderate optical depth. In addition, the inversion process generates values of cloud top height and temperature, cloud depth and column liquid water content. The method is used to observe the development of orographic cloud formed over the southern half of the North Island of New Zealand. The inversion results for this type of cloud are in agreement with aircraft measurements carried out by the New Zealand Meteorological Service and are well fitted by a simple drop-growth model.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the magellanic clouds and other southern objects at TeV energies</field><field name="creator">Bond, Ian Anthony</field><field name="description">The results of observational studies of very high energy (VHE) and ultra high energy (UHE) gamma ray emission, by various astrophysical objects, made from 1988 to 1990 with the JANZOS Cerenkov facility are presented. The active galaxy Cen A and the Galactic X-ray binary systems Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and Cir X-1 were monitored for VHE gamma ray emission above 1 TeV. No evidence was found for persistent or episodic emission from any of these objects. Upper limits on the VHE fluxes above 1 TeV of 2.1&#215;10-11, 2.7&#215;10-11, 3.6&#215;10-11 and 3.5&#215;10-11 cm-2 s-1 respectively were obtained for these objects. These limits are consistent with previous observations made by other groups. Various objects in the Magellanic Clouds were monitored for UHE gamma ray emission using the Cerenkov technique at large zenith angles. This technique has been found to be more sensitive at UHE energies -100 TeV than the conventional air shower technique. During 1990 the equipment was modified to allow a sky coverage of 7&#176;&#215;23&#176; at large zenith angles. This enabled most of the extent of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be surveyed at UHE energies. An examination of the UHE database yielded no evidence for persistent emission from SN1987A and selected X-ray pulsars in the Magellanic Clouds. Upper limits on the UHE fluxes (in cm-2s-1) above the given threshold energies were obtained as follows: SMC X-1, 2.4&#215;10-13 (&gt;30 TeV); SN1987A, 2.3&#215;10-13 (&gt;65 TeV); PSR0540-693, 2.3&#215;10-13(&gt;65 TeV); LMC Trans, 1.5&#215;10-13(&gt;130 TeV); LMC X-4, 1.3&#215;l0-l3 (&gt;140 TeV). Evidence was found for two episodes of pulsed gamma ray emission above 65 TeV from SN1987A. On the nights of May 28 and June 23, 1990, a periodicity search using the Rayleigh test showed significant power at 18.356 ms. This is near a periodicity reported at optical wavelengths in September, 1990. The chance probability for the individual period was about 10-6 on each of the two nights. Excess events of the order of 1&#963; were also seen on these nights. The overall chance probability, allowing for all degrees of freedom, was found to be 0.1%. Evidence was also found for a single episode of gamma ray emission above 140 TeV from LMC X-4 on May 27, 1990. Excess events were seen with a statistical significance of 2.4 &#963;. A periodicity test showed maximum Rayleigh power at 13.488 s on this night. The chance probability for the individual period was 8&#215;10-3 and the overall chance probability was found to be 0.5%. Adopting a recent estimate of the pulsar population in the Large Magellanic Cloud, an upper bound of 3&#215;1034 erg s-1 on the luminosity of an average pulsar, at energies &gt;65 TeV, was obtained.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blueschists and associated rocks in the south Sepik region, Papua New Guinea; field relations, petrology, mineralogy, metamorphism and tectonic setting</field><field name="creator">Ryburn, Roderick James</field><field name="description">Blueschists in the South Sepik region of Papua New Guinea are one of several poorly known occurrences along the northern margin of New Guinea's Central Orogenic Belt. It is believed that they formed in a northward-dipping subduction zone, beneath a Palaeogene arc system now accreted along the north coast of New Guinea, and that they now lie within a Tertiary continent-arc collision zone. The South Sepik blueschists, or Tau Blueschist, are situated near the centre of New Guinea, on the northern fall of the island's axial mountains, and are mostly contained in an allochthonous east-west lens (55 x 8 km) known as the Tau body. There are also some much smaller allochthons to the east of the Tau body. The blueschists occur within the late-Mesozoic to Eocene Salumei Formation, which is believed to be a tectonic mixture of mostly politic sediments, derived from the continent to the south, and ophiolite fragments and other volcanogenic rocks, related to the arc to the north. Near the Tau body, the Salumei Formation is metamorphosed from prehnite-pumpellyite to low-greenschist grade. Stratigraphic constraints and isotopic dating indicate an Oligocene to early Miocene metamorphism of the Tau Blueschist, Salumei Formation, and other metamorphic rocks in the region. The blueschists are mostly massive to well-foliated mafic schists, containing abundant blue amphibole, but there are also some intimately associated pelitic-calcareous-graphitic metasediments. Within the Tau body the metamorphic grade increases towards the north, from lawsonite rocks to high-grade epidote blueschists. The lowest grade blueschists are pumpellyitic lawsonitic metabasites, known only from river float. In addition, there are zones and isolated occurrences of coarsely crystalline mafic tectonic blocks, within and just north of the Tau body. These include high-grade blueschist, eclogite and amphibolite. There is a complete spectrum from blueschist to eclogite. Whole-rock chemistry indicates, that all basic rocks are probably metamorphosed mafic ophiolite. The mineralogy and mineral chemistry is similar to other circum-Pacific blueschists, particularly those in New Caledonia. The blue amphibole is glaucophane or crossite, but ferroglaucophane occurs in the lawsonite zone. It is sometimes accompanied by Ca-amphibole, ranging from actinolite, in the lawsonite zone, to barroisite, in the epidote zone. Some metabasites and metasediments contain grossularitic almandine garnet, spessartine rich at low grade to pyropic at high grade. Sodic pyroxene is not particularly common in the blueschists, and is generally an acmitic variety, although omphacite occurs in eclogites. Paragonite is common in the epidote zone, often associated with phengite, while chlorite and albite are present at all grades, generally in small amounts. Calcite, dolomite and chloritoid occur in metasediments of the epidote zone. The unique assemblage lawsonite-glaucophane-chloritoid was found. Apart from zoning in minerals, and minor retrograde alteration, most rocks appear to be equilibrium assemblages, and obey the phase rule. The conditions of metamorphism are estimated from available experimental studies, and calculations based on mineral thermodynamic data. Equilibria involving lawsonite, epidote, grossular, albite, paragonite and quartz suggest 395&#176;C and 7.5 kbar at the disappearance of lawsonite. Metasediments in the middle of the epidote zone yield a minimum of 420&#176;C from the calcite-dolomite geothermometer, and 444&#176; &#177; 20&#176;C from coexistence of chloritoid, garnet, albite paragonite and quartz. A pressure of 10-11 kbar at 500&#176;C is calculated from garnet, epidote, albite, paragonite and quartz in the highest grade blueschists. Corrections to the muscovite-paragonite solvus for pressure and non-binary components give plausible temperatures and pressures for coexisting white micas. Mineral stabilities, and equilibria between paragonite, jadeite, albite, grossular and zoisite, indicate a maximum of 550&#176;C and 15 kbar for eclogites, and that current versions of the garnet-clinopyroxene thermometer are not giving accurate results in eclogites with high jadeite or acmite in the pyroxene. From buffer equilibria between calcite and Ca-Al silicates in metasediments, the non-ideal mole fraction of CO2 is estimated to be about 0.02 in the epidote zone, and 0.002 in the lawsonite zone. Graphite, pyrite and pyrrhotite in metasediments allow calculation of fluid composition in the system C-H-O-S, and show that very minor CH and H2S were present. Water activities may have been high in some eclogites. The metamorphic conditions require that both blueschists and eclogites were formed in a subduction system, and support the continent-arc collision hypothesis. However, some form of active and rapid transport is needed to bring these rocks back to shallow levels, and the term "retrojection" is coined.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface analysis of particulate emissions before and after atmospheric aging</field><field name="creator">Henshaw, Geoffrey Stephen</field><field name="description">The reactions and transformations of atmospheric primary particles have been studied using the surface analysis techniques of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Particles emitted from a steel mill were studied at their point of emission, during transport through the atmosphere and after deposition. The mill was located in a coastal region removed from other major industrial particle sources which made the identification of the mill particulate emissions possible in ambient samples. The mill utilizes indigenous titanomagnetite ironsand and coal as the raw materials. There is evidence of the surface enrichment of volatile trace elements such as Zn, S, Na, K and P from the raw materials in the particulate emissions. Particle samples were collected from sites within the mill which represented different stages in the iron-making process, including the rotary kilns, electric melting furnaces and the vanadium recovery plant. This established an inventory of particulate emissions. Mill sourced particles were then identified and studied in air samples collected downwind of the mill on silver-coated nucleopore filters. AES and SIMS depth profiling studies indicated the mill particles became surface enriched in sea salt components such as S, predominately as sulfate, Cl- and Na+ after atmospheric aging. This was attributed to their coagulation with the marine derived ambient aerosol. SIMS ion imaging and mass spectral analysis suggested a characteristic "fingerprint" of the mill emissions could be distinguished in the ambient aerosol up to 8 km downwind of the mill. An experimental rig was constructed to model the interaction between the mill particles and the natural marine aerosol. A bubble nebuliser was developed to produce an artificial sea salt aerosol which was reacted with a metal powder in the fluidised bed of the rig. The metal powder was then aged under controlled relative humidity (RH) conditions. It was shown that an iron powder, after reaction and aging at 75% RH, developed an aqueous surface layer which quickly led to electrochemical corrosion, dissolution and oxidation of the particle surface. Evidence of this corrosion of metal particles occurring in the environment was found in a SEM-EDX study of the mill particles deposited on pine needles downwind of the mill. It was argued that these reactions would increase the bio-availability of the particle components. A model which incorporated these observations was developed to describe the morphogenesis of atmospheric primary particles during aging in the New Zealand environment. XPS was used to study ambient aerosols deposited on both botanical and artificial passive sampling surfaces. Plant leaves were shown to be excellent collectors of particulate material and were suited to analysis by XPS. Site differences in the atmospheric aerosol load and composition were detected on vine leaves located on a hill side (high NaCl) and at a roadside (high sulfate and silicates) in a rural area. Zn and Fe species were detected by XPS on pine needles up to 2 km downwind of the steel mill.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic Applications of Bayesian Inference to Glass Evidence</field><field name="creator">Curran, James Michael</field><field name="description">The role of the scientist in the courtroom has come under more scrutiny this century than ever before.

Statistics can provide objectivity to subjective assessments and strengthen a case for the prosecution or the defence, but only if is used correctly.
