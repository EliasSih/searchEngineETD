The main goal of this study was to find the conditions for sun drying that maximise the throughput while minimising quality loss. A whole-bed approach was taken to investigate the conditions of the grain and the air at different layers during the drying process. Seven sets of sun-drying experiments were conducted in Cambodia using a range of methods practiced by rice farmers. These methods included drying with different bed depths (2 to 6 cm), with the bed on different pads (water-proof tarpaulin, mat, net, polystyrene or rice husk), and with different bed tempering methods (stirring regularly or shading and/or covering the bed around midday) for four Cambodian rice varieties (Pka Knhey, CAR11, Masary and IR66). The grain temperature was found to be more affected by the solar intensity than the temperature of the ambient air. Fastest drying was achieved when the bed was thin, less compacted, stirred regularly but not shaded or covered around midday, dried on a pad which allows some air and moisture movement and with high or strong solar intensity. Only the mechanical impact (MI) and milling tests of the rice quality provided useful results. Higher quality was found for grain that was dried in thin beds, stirred regularly, shaded with or without covering around midday and dried on pads with less air circulation. Among the methods used to determine the glass transition temperature of the grain, only the Differential Scanning Calorimetry method gave meaningful results. The glass transition temperature data were highly variable but generally decreased with increasing moisture content and compared quite well with the published glass transition temperatures for other varieties of rice. To provide additional detail on the local conditions within the bed, to better understand the drying process and the interactions between variables and to predict alternative parameters that might be used to correlate with the head rice yields (HRYs), a mathematical model for heat and moisture transport within the bed was developed. The model covered all the drying methods/conditions studied experimentally. A lumped parameter approach to energy and mass transfer in individual kernels was used in the bed model. The model was validated against experimental data. The predicted drying time, temperatures, moisture contents and water activities (relative humidity of the air within the bed) were found to compare very well with the experimental data except when a polystyrene pad was used. The model proved to be a very good mechanistic tool with advantages of simplicity and practical accuracy in the design and management of the sun drying system. A number of parameters related to postulated grain damage mechanisms were derived from the predicted conditions within the bed during drying. The best predictors of the grain quality were found to be rewetting the kernels when the grain is bulked (especially when the kernels are partly below and partly above critical moisture content) grain temperature and distance from the glass transition temperature line. It was concluded that in order to get the fastest drying conditions rice should be sun dried with thin bed, stirring, not shaded or covered around midday and dried on a pad with air circulation. For the highest quality grain, that is grain which would have the least breakage during milling, rice should be sun dried with a thin bed, stirring, shaded or covered around midday and dried on a pad with less air circulation. The optimal drying conditions to get the best quality combined with the fastest practical drying rate, the drying conditions should be drying with 2 cm bed depth, stirring the grain bed every hour, shading or covering the bed around midday and using a tarpaulin or net pad placed directly on the ground.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">sun drying</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300304 Post harvest technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/620</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing debris transport pathways on constructional ridges : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Quaternary Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mandolla, Stephanie</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that Mt Ruapehu, Tongariro National Park, New Zealand, was heavily glaciated during the Pleistocene. Eight small glaciers can still be found on the summit of this active volcano. However, the glaciers have been retreating at a fast rate during the last few centuries. The scientific community has placed its main focus on the volcanic aspects of the region. Although most authors refer to the landforms that appear to be of glacial origin as &#8216;moraines&#8217;, no actual glacial studies have been undertaken so far to provide the necessary evidence that is needed to support this hypothesis. The aim of this study is to use established field techniques in glacial geomorphology to (1) identify the extent of glacial deposits using diagnostic criteria and (2) to reconstruct the transport pathways of the Wahianoa Glacier. Four main diagnostic criteria have been used: clast morphology, macrofabrics, grain size distribution and the surface texture of grains. The Wahianoa valley has a very pronounced U-shape and is likely to be of glacial origin. The valley consists of two elongate debris ridges that are made out of unconsolidated, poorly sorted diamict of varying lithologies. This study has identified that the activity and the composition of the volcano has lead to complex glacial processes. Glacial ice has advanced over a deformable bed and the glacier itself was probably extensively covered by supraglacial debris. The area has been identified as a pre-historic pathway for lahars and the volcano erupts frequently to produce fresh volcanic deposits. As the active vent has changed its position during the eruptive history of the volcano, the quantity and the location of the source rock that fed the glacier has varied greatly. This study is an initial attempt at unfolding the glacial history of Mt Ruapehu. This is based on field analysis of glacigenic sediments, rather than topographic and aerial photo analysis. The results show great complexity and the potential for further studies of other moraine systems on Mt Ruapehu.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciology</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260115 Glaciology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/621</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental resistance : mobile and transitory discourses : a discursive analysis of parental resistance towards medical treatment for a seriously ill child : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Woods, Martin</field><field name="description">This qualitative thesis uses discourse analysis to examine parental resistance towards medical treatment of critically ill children. It is an investigation of the &#8216;mobile and transitory&#8217; discourses at play in instances of resistance between parents, physicians and nurses within health care institutions, and an examination of the consequences of resistance through providing alternative ways of perceiving and therefore understanding these disagreements. The philosophical perspectives, methodology and methods used in this thesis are underpinned by selected ideas taken from the works of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu and supported by relevant literature in the fields of media, law, children, parenting, caring, serious childhood illness, medicine and nursing. The thesis obtains information from a variety of texts that includes established literature (such as medical, sociological, legal, academic and philosophical), newspaper articles, radio or television interviews, internet sources, court reports and proceedings, legal experts and other commentators &#8211; and 15 interview based texts, where the focus is on analyses of narratives of parents, doctors and nurses. In the texts gathered for this thesis, there are noticeable differences between the personal experience discourses of parents, the &#8216;in-between&#8217; discourses of nurses, and the disciplined discourses of physicians. This thesis brings these discourses into conversation with each other suggesting that parental resistance does not occur because of an infrequent and unusual set of circumstances where a few socially isolated and/or &#8216;difficult&#8217; parents disagree with the treatment desires of paediatric physicians. Instead, it is argued that from an examination of interview based texts, parental resistance is an omnipresent but transitory occurrence that affects many of the interactions between the parents of seriously ill children and clinical staff. It is maintained that within these interactions, the seeds of this resistance are sown in both critical decision making situations and in everyday occurrences between doctors, nurses and parents within healthcare institutions. Contributing factors to parental resistance include the use of power games by staff, the language of medicine, forms of symbolic violence, the presence or absence of trust between parents and medical staff, the effects of medical habitus, and challenges to the parental role and identity. Overall, it is proposed in this thesis that parents who resist treatment for their seriously ill child are not exceptions to the normative patient-physician relationship. Instead an analysis of their discourses and practices is able to illuminate the complex interactions between patients and medical conventions. It is therefore possible to see parents who resist medical advice not as peripheral to the medical encounter but as examples of how patient-physician relationships come to be codified, constructed and crafted through everyday discourses and practices within health care settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">parent-doctor</field><field name="subject">seriously ill child</field><field name="subject">pediatric care</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/622</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Everyday spirituality : supporting the spiritual experience of young children in three early childhood educational settings : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bone, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is the spiritual experience of young children in early childhood educational settings. Spirituality is included in the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, Te Whariki, but is a relatively unarticulated aspect of educational practice. In order to find out how spirituality is supported in early childhood educational contexts this qualitative case study research took place in three early childhood settings: a Montessori casa, a private preschool and a Steiner (Waldorf) kindergarten. The methods used in the research included participant observation, interviews and focus groups. The teachers were asked to make a video about spirituality to reflect their own context and photographs were taken in each setting. The metaphor of spiritual landscape is used in this research. In this landscape everyday experience merged with the spiritual to form the concept of everyday spirituality. The cultural theories of everyday life supported a realisation that ordinary daily activity can become wonderful and mysterious when the spiritual dimension is realised. The themes that emerged from analysis of the case studies are conceptualised as transformative aspects of learning and relationships. They are aspects of everyday spirituality identified as spiritual withness; spiritual inbetweenness; and the spiritually elsewhere. Representing spiritual experience is challenging. The thesis is written in narrative form and contains core narratives as prose and poems. Using writing as a means of discovery made communicating spirituality through the medium of words a possibility. Spirituality is proposed to be an inclusive concept that affirms a sense of connection and this thesis found that all pedagogical practices in early childhood settings have the potential to include a spiritual aspect. In Aotearoa New Zealand many children lead their everyday lives in the context of an early childhood environment that includes teachers and parents as part of that community. This thesis argues that when everyday spirituality permeates early childhood contexts that all aspects of the curriculum are realised and the spiritual experience of everyone connected to that setting is supported.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">spiritual landscape</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/623</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems analysis of quadbike loss of control events on New Zealand farms : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management Systems and Ergonomics at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Moore, David John</field><field name="description">There are an estimated 70,000 quadbikes (also called All-Terrain Vehicles, four-wheelers or ATV) in use within the farming community in New Zealand, and these have been linked to approximately seven deaths per year since 1997. ACC paid compensation in excess of $3.6 million on new and on-going quadbike-related claims in 2003-4, and the Department of Labour (OSH) have identified quadbike use as their single greatest area of concern in farm safety. The main aims of this series of studies were to: establish the scale and cost of LCE involving quadbikes as well as their context of use on New Zealand farms, develop an investigative methodology suitable for off-road application, identify risk factors for LCE and their interactions, and generate potential interventions. The research comprised a literature review and three studies. The first was an epidemiological analysis of ACC claims data for serious quadbike-related injuries in the year to July 2001, identified individually through the free narrative text in the ACC database. The second study explored the context of farm quadbike use through data gathering with multiple industry sources including users at the 55 farms visited for the third study. This final phase consisted of investigations at the scenes of 156 LCE. Data on the event sequences and contributory factors were captured and analysed using a modified event sequence chart developed from established methods in the ergonomics, forensics psychology and aviation literature. Environmental context-dependent cues and scale models of quadbikes and implements were used to assist the subjects recall event details. An interactive quadbike LCE model incorporating information processing features was developed as a further analysis tool. Potential interventions were identified acting at various system levels. These included changes in: farm management, work organisation, regulation, vehicle conceptualisation, detailed quadbike design and modification, rider awareness and training.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quadbikes</field><field name="subject">loss of control events</field><field name="subject">accidents</field><field name="subject">farm safety</field><field name="subject">systems analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/624</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Rainbow Nation to the Land of the Long White Cloud : migration, gender and biography : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Meares, Carina</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to and extends two well-established traditions in sociology: firstly, it uses a biographical approach to study the experience of international migration; and secondly, it generates theory from the lived texture of individual lives. Specifically, the research uses the Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) to describe, analyse and theorise the gendered experience of migration from &#8216;the rainbow nation&#8217; of South Africa, to New Zealand, &#8216;the land of the long white cloud&#8217;. The thesis follows and further develops BNIM&#8217;s sociobiographic approach, integrating a stronger sociological focus, and emphasising the feminist values of transparency, reflexivity and an attention to power differences between the researcher and her interviewees. In-depth interviews based on a single narrative-seeking question are conducted with South African migrants from several divergent groups, and are then used as the foundation for a process of intensive researcher-led group analysis. From this meticulous analytical process the researcher produces three detailed individual case studies. It is argued that in order to comprehend the significance of broad social phenomena such as migration and gender, it is imperative to have an appreciation of their meaning in the context of individual lives. Noting the occurrence of migration-related disruption across each of the case studies, the thesis uses the concept of biographical disruption to generate an innovative analytic vocabulary and a model that together describe and represent the gendered biographical experience of international migration. The research also uses the analytic language and the model to illustrate the impact of migration on the gender dynamics of migrants&#8217; intimate relationships. It does this by considering one of the pivotal tensions through which gender dynamics are reconstructed in the context of migration, the tension between migrants&#8217; productive and reproductive responsibilities. The language and the model theorise the resolution of this tension in a number of ways, thus extending the terms of the debate about the impact of migration on gender dynamics beyond the current binary conceptualisation of emancipation or subjugation. The utility of the language and the model in their depiction of the overall biographical experience of migration, and the illustration of the effect of migration on gender dynamics is demonstrated in the thesis through their application to each of the individual case studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international migration</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sociobiography</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370500 Demography::370502 Migration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/625</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refugees as 'others' : social and cultural citizenship rights for refugees in New Zealand health services : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mortensen, Annette Claire</field><field name="description">Citizenship, as effective social, cultural and economic participation for refugee groups, depends on appropriate institutional structures and processes in resettlement societies. This thesis using critical social theoretical perspectives addresses the paradox of being legally a citizen, but substantively excluded from the very rights that constitute such citizenship. The thesis draws on theoretical models of newcomer integration in order to promote the development of a more inclusive society for refugees in New Zealand. The issues to be considered include responses from central government and from public institutions&#8212;particularly health, education, employment and welfare&#8212;in addressing social exclusion and promoting integration. The questions of refugee integration to be addressed conceptually must take into consideration cultural and religious diversity, on the one hand, and socio-economic inequality on the other. In New Zealand, the 1987 review of refugee resettlement policy, which established an annual quota of 750 places, has given priority to those with the highest health and social needs and removed preferences for specific national, ethnic and religious groups. Significantly, in the 1990s radical neo-liberal economic reforms were introduced and publicly provided health, education and welfare systems were restructured. This posed serious challenges to the core idea of social citizenship in general in New Zealand society. Noticeable ethnic diversification has been just one element of the resettlement policy changes; the other has been long-term social and economic exclusion in the refugee groups settled since this time. This study indicates that New Zealand&#8217;s notably humanitarian refugee resettlement policy is not matched by adequate central government and public institutional responses and resources with which to integrate refugee groups. This qualitative study examines the role of one institution in particular, health care. The study takes a multi-method approach, using historical and social policy analysis to set the structural context for the interpretation of data from participant interviews. During fieldwork, twenty-eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with health care providers in community, primary and secondary care sectors in the Auckland region, in both governmental and non-governmental agencies. This research demonstrates at a service level, the consequences of overlooking refugee peoples in New Zealand social policy, data collection systems, research and health strategies. Importantly though, the research discovers a number of &#8216;activation points&#8217;&#8212;or approaches that have been developed by health care practitioners&#8212;that highlight future opportunities for the inclusion of refugee groups. One finding is that the New Zealand health system must address the question of how to effect a shift from universalist conceptions of generalised eligibility for health services to targeted interventions for refugees. The conclusions drawn from the study are: firstly, that an overarching integration policy for refugees, led by central government, is required. Secondly, institutional responses that accommodate the special psychosocial, socio-economic and cultural/religious requirements of refugee groups are needed. This would include the development of a locally relevant multiculturalism to guide social policy in New Zealand. In the long-term, for peoples from refugee backgrounds to become full political, social, economic and cultural members of New Zealand society, there needs to be a rethinking of the contemporary models of citizenship offered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refugees</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social citizenship</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">cultural citizenship</field><field name="subject">heath system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/631</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searchbots.net : the influence of a narrative interface on the motivational levels of user contribution to an open content search engine : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Design, Institute of Communication Design, College of Creative Arts, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zeman, Mark</field><field name="description">This study sets out to explore and test the application of narrative and personification to the interface design and user experience of a search engine.

It examines the formation of parishes, the appointment of clergy, the construction of church buildings and the provision of finance &#8211; in other words, all that was required for the provision of ministry in local communities. It is less concerned with the administration of dioceses, the accomplishments of bishops, the activities of General Synod, and constitutional issues, except where these had a bearing on the core issue. Similarly, it does not concern itself with the development of social services, the establishment of schools, and the building of cathedrals. In the same way, it does not give attention to the issue of provision of ministry to and by Maori. That history is too important to be absorbed into this topic. It demands serious treatment from someone with the necessary skills and background. The present writer lacks that competence. Settler Anglicanism ministered to 40 per cent of the population and did so in every town and suburb, and virtually every rural area in the land. No other social institution had such wide coverage. It is not a story of triumph but of dedication and difficulty, of frustration and exasperation, and of challenges and lost opportunities. There was never enough money to meet every need, there were never enough clergy to provide adequate staffing, and often never enough adequate buildings. External forces (including two world wars, a major economic depression and natural disasters) upset carefully laid plans. It was a Church that was &#8216;in the midst&#8217;. It rarely sought to escape from the world; more often its endeavour was to be there with its people, sharing their sorrows and joys, providing the ministrations for the big events of their lives, and nurturing them in regular worship, Sunday schools and women&#8217;s groups, and building a sense of community. This was the church of an important section of the community, a community that was at the same time at the heart of New Zealand society and yet aware of its English origins and residual loyalties. On the whole, church members acquiesced in this dilemma for no strong revolutionary spirit was alive in them. The call for a distinctive New Zealand version of Anglicanism was a muted one. They were no less loyal to New Zealand; it was simply that it was a New Zealand that was proud to be part of the British Empire, and a Church that was proud to be part of a Church of England. If any common thread emerges, it is the continuing plea to the members of this Church to raise up from among themselves men who would minister to their own people in their own land &#8211; &#8216;sound, adaptable, missionary-hearted men, who are not afraid to tackle hard problems and difficulties of many kinds&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/633</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">T&#257;niko : public participation, young M&#257;ori women, &amp; wh&#257;nau health : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gray, Katarina Ani Putepute</field><field name="description">Recent M&#257;ori, sexual, and primary health developments have been influenced by the principle of participation. For example, the use of a wh&#257;nau-centred approach, of community development, and of Primary Health Organisations allows participation in decision-making. However, none of the abovenamed strategies adequately explain how young M&#257;ori women can participate in decision-making in one common area: M&#257;ori, sexual, primary health policy. This thesis explores how Primary Health Organisations can work with young M&#257;ori women to promote sexual health to wh&#257;nau by focusing on policymaking processes and effective participation mechanisms. M&#257;ori health development from colonial Contact to 2005 is reviewed before the broad health framework (the New Zealand Health Strategy and the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000) is defined. A critique of relevant policy, in particular He Korowai Oranga (2002), the Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy (2001), and The Primary Health Care Strategy (2001), reveals scope for participation and wh&#257;nau-centredness. Primary Health Organisations pose challenges to wh&#257;nau sexual health promotion. However, with public participation from young M&#257;ori women, like the thesis participants, new opportunities can be realised. The research was conducted in accordance with a Mana W&#257;hine-based methodology called T&#257;niko The four parts (Mana W&#257;hine, Te Ao Tawhito, Te Ao Hou, and Te Ao M&#257;rama) defined the research aim and objectives. A qualitative strategy employing semi-structured interviews with three young M&#257;ori women was followed by a confirmatory stage of content analysis utilising a deductive public participation evaluation tool: the T&#257;niko instrument. The instrument analysed four policymaking decisions and two mechanisms: organised peer groups and the w&#257;hine-centred approach. The research concluded that when defining how, by whom, and to whom information is presented, organised peer groups can be utilised at the coordination and evaluation policymaking stages. The w&#257;hine-centred approach can share or manage participation through problem definition, consultation, decision, and implementation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">health framework</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">wh&#257;nau</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/640</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grappling with complexity : finding the core problems behind aircraft accidents : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Aviation at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zotov, Dmitri Victorovitch</field><field name="description">The purpose of accident investigation is the discovery of causal factors, so that they may be remedied, in order to avert the recurrence of accidents (ICAO, 1994). However, experience has shown that the present intuitive methods of analysis do not always achieve this aim. Investigation failure may come about because of failure to discover causal factors, or to devise effective remedies, or to persuade those in a position to act of the need to do so. Each of these types of failure can be made less likely by the use of formal analytical methods which can show whether information gathering has been incomplete, and point to the sources of additional information that may be needed. A formal analysis can be examined by formal logical tests. Also, the use of formal change mechanisms can not only devise changes likely to be effective, but can present these changes in such a way that the case for them is compelling. Formal methods currently available are concerned with what happened, and why it happened. To produce generic remedies which might avert future accidents of similar type, some formal change mechanism is needed. The Theory of Constraints has become widely adopted in business as a way of replacing undesirable effects with desired outcomes. The Theory of Constraints has not previously been used for safety investigation, and a principal object of this thesis is to see whether it can usefully be employed in this area. It is demonstrated that the use of formal methodology can bring to light factors which were overlooked during an official accident investigation, and can &#8216;tell the story&#8217; in a more coherent manner than is possible with present methods. The recommendations derived from the formal analysis are shown to be generic in nature, rather than particular to the airline involved and the accident studied, and so could have a wider effect in improving safety.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accident investigation</field><field name="subject">Theory of Constraints</field><field name="subject">aircraft accidents</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350400 Transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/641</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-thinking drowning risk : the role of water safety knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in the aquatic recreation of New Zealand youth : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moran, Kevin</field><field name="description">This study evolved from concerns about the number of young people drowning in New Zealand (544 deaths between 1980-1994), the author&#8217;s long experience with surf life saving and the suspicion that participation statistics on aquatic recreation do not adequately explain why so many young people drown. It was postulated that the risk of drowning associated with aquatic recreation also was the consequence of many underlying water safety influences that operate at intrapersonal, interpersonal and community levels. Thus the purpose of the study was to obtain comprehensive data on what young people know, think and do about their safety during aquatic recreation. A 25-item questionnaire was designed to survey a randomised sample of New Zealand youth (2202, year 11, 15 &#8211; 19 year olds) to assess their participation in, knowledge about and behaviour during aquatic recreation. To develop the questionnaire, a conceptual framework was devised that constructed the risk of drowning as a complex phenomenon dependent on how often young people participate in various forms of water-based activities, but largely influenced by their water safety knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, all of which are shaped by social, cultural and demographic variables. Almost all New Zealand youth had taken part in some swimming (98%) or other aquatic activity (94%) in the previous year. Risk of drowning was exacerbated among many students because they had poor water safety skills and knowledge, held unsound water safety attitudes, and often practiced at-risk behaviours. For example, many students estimated that they could not swim more than 100 m (54%), thought that swimming was acceptable at a surf beach after patrol hours (61%), and had swum outside patrol flags (61%) or never worn lifejacket (19%) during aquatic recreation. Taken separately, any one of these dispositions is capable of heightening drowning risk; taken collectively they offer strong explanation as to why youth are at greater risk of drowning than others. When analysed by gender, the lack of water safety knowledge, the prevalence of unsafe attitudes and at-risk behaviours among males was consistent and pronounced. The effect of socio-economic status and ethnicity on these risk-enhancing dispositions was less pronounced, although the data did suggest that the knowledge base of youth from low-decile schools and of Pasifika and Asian ethnicity provided least protective potential in the event of unintentional submersion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic recreation</field><field name="subject">water safety</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">drowning</field><field name="subject">safety education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/642</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation of PCP by laccases of the white-rot fungus Trametes sp.

Its use was discontinued due to its toxicity to humans and animals. White-rot fungi have been shown to degrade PCP in laboratory and field trials. New Zealand native white-rot fungi were screened to identify organisms suitable for the clean up of PCP contaminated sites. Four criteria were used for the screening: fungal growth at different temperatures, PCP and creosote resistance and PCP degradation in standard liquid medium. Twenty isolates were identified as potentially useful from over 200 that were screened. One unique isolate, Trametes sp. HR577, was chosen for intensive study because it produced the well known laccases previously described from other PCP-degrading white-rot fungi. The white-rot isolate HR577 was assigned to the genus Trametes based on morphological characteristics and gene sequencing studies. The latter showed that the partial laccase gene sequences from Trametes sp. HR 577 had high sequence homology to laccases from other Trametes species, especially T. versicolor and T. villosa. Two laccase isozymes, designated L1c and L2, were purified from Trametes sp. HR577. These isozymes had similar biological properties to other Trametes species laccase isozymes. Both isozymes had a relatively high temperature optima, however, they were not very stable at elevated temperature. The dependence of laccase on dissolved oxygen for catalysis was demonstrated for isozyme L2. Laccase activity was severely inhibited in the absence of dissolved oxygen. This could be restored by reoxygenation into the assay system. Whole cultures of Trametes sp. HR577 grown in liquid culture removed up to 76% of PCP after 72 hours. PCP removal was mostly due to degradation rather than adsorption of PCP to fungal mycelium. Addition of purified and crude laccase isozymes (100 U mL-1) did not enhance PCP degradation. 6-15% of PCP was removed from solutions containing solely purified isozyme L1c or L2 in acetate buffer over 72 hours. Addition of ethanol or the laccase mediator compound 2,2' azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) resulted in increased PCP disappearance from purified laccase cultures. These studies show that the white-rot Trametes sp. HR577 has potential to be used for the clean up of PCP contaminated sites in NZ.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pentachlorophenol</field><field name="subject">white-rot fungi</field><field name="subject">site remediation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/643</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strain and structure of a temperate, maritime glacier : Te Moeka o Tuawe / Fox Glacier, South Westland, New Zealand : thesis submitted in fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in Physical Geography, at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Appleby, John Richard</field><field name="description">The study of glaciers has an immense significance for understanding and predicting global environmental change. The Earth is a dynamic system, consisting of individual units such as the cryosphere, an understanding of which may provide the basis for predicting future environmental change on a global scale. The dynamics of a glacier, a major indicator of the climatic and environmental situation is often presented as supraglacial structures, which reflect glacier formation, deformation and flow. Although structural attributes such as folds, faults, crevasse traces and foliation are commonly described in glaciers, the origin and significance of many of these structures remains unclear. This research project mapped the surface structures of Fox Glacier, using remote sensing in the form of aerial photographs and field observations, to produce a structural glaciological interpretation of the glacier surface, structural field maps of individual structures, and a schematic structural evolution of Fox Glacier. In addition, cumulative strain, and strain rates were calculated for three different areas of the lower Fox Glacier. The relationship between the observed structures and the measured strain rates has also been considered. Fox Glacier is located in the South Westland region of the South Island of New Zealand. From the Main Divide of the Southern Alps up to 3000m altitude, Fox Glacier flows for 13 km, terminating at an altitude of 270 metres in temperate rainforest, 17 km from the present coastline. The steep gradient allows for relatively rapid ice flow. Despite being a very dynamic glacier, very little research has been carried out on Fox Glacier in recent years with most research in the area being concentrated on its neighbour the Franz Josef, and even more so on the glaciers of the Eastern side of the Main Divide (e.g. the Tasman and Mueller glaciers). There is a high level of spatial variability in structural types observed, and the cumulative strain and strain rates measured on the surface of the Fox Glacier, with the variations being linked to valley topography including long-profile gradient and valley width. Strain rates of 208.78 y-1 and -162.06 y-1 were recorded on Fox Glacier. A relationship can be determined between observed glaciological structural features and measured strain rates, suggesting strain rate has an influence on the type, magnitude, location and frequency of these features, however, the study is only a &#8216;snap-shot&#8217; of the strain conditions experienced in the most dynamically active time, during the summer ablation season. Developing predictive models of the structural evolution of glaciers may help further understanding of how glaciers respond to a change in climatic input, especially climatic warming. This is particularly important for larger ice sheet outlet glaciers whose structure and flow appear to reflect and control dynamics of the ice sheet behind</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciology</field><field name="subject">Fox Glacier</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">strain</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260115 Glaciology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/644</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a balanced and ethically responsible approach to understanding differences in sleep timing : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Sleep/Wake Research Centre, Wellington Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Paine, Te Hereripine Sarah-Jane</field><field name="description">The circadian clock defines physiologically optimal times for sleeping, which vary along a continuum of circadian phenotypes from morning- to evening-type. Although different &#8216;chronotypes&#8217; can be discriminated reliably by the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), there is little published information on their prevalence. The timing of sleep is also heavily influenced by societal norms. However, the relative contribution of circadian physiology versus psychosocial factors is unknown. This thesis took a multidimensional approach to investigating preferred sleep timing within the general population of New Zealand (30-49 years). A New Zealand version of the MEQ was mailed to a random stratified sample of 5,000 adults living in the Wellington region (55.7% response rate). Using scoring criteria for middle-aged adults, approximately 25% of the population were morning-types and 25% were evening-types. The sleeping patterns of 15 morning- and 16 evening-types were monitored using actiwatches and sleep diaries. Morning-types slept significantly earlier, but there were no differences in sleep duration or quality. Both chronotypes showed evidence of using the weekend to catch-up on sleep, although this was more evident among evening-types. Differences between chronotypes were also investigated using the endogenous melatonin rhythm as a circadian phase marker. The timing of the melatonin rhythm was earlier among morning-types, with the difference being greater for melatonin onset, than offset. However, differences between weekday versus weekend sleep explained more of the variability in sleep timing that did circadian phase. Understanding the genetic differences in the circadian clock is evolving rapidly. While this is of particular scientific interest, little consideration has been given to the ethical implications of this type of work. In the final study, a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework was used to explore M&#257;ori hopes and concerns for genetic research in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Thematic analysis indicated that M&#257;ori are not anti-science, however there is an urgent need for ethical guidelines that uphold and respect the values of M&#257;ori society. This thesis argues that sleep is a major public health issue for New Zealand.

The Chatham Island T&#257;iko (Tch&#257;ik, Pterodroma magentae) is the world&#8217;s most endangered seabird with an estimated population size of just 120-150 birds, including only 8-15 breeding pairs. This thesis used genetic techniques to investigate aspects of T&#257;iko biology and relationships in order to aid T&#257;iko conservation. The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and duplicated regions of domain I of the mitochondrial control region were DNA sequenced in almost the entire known T&#257;iko population. The level of genetic variation revealed in T&#257;iko was unexpectedly high considering endangered species typically exhibit low genetic diversity. Sequencing of ancient DNA from subfossil T&#257;iko bones allowed an investigation of the past level of genetic variation and the species&#8217; previous geographic distribution. A large proportion of the genetic diversity of the extinct T&#257;iko populations was retained in the remnant population. However, genetic variation in T&#257;iko chicks was low, thus genetic diversity in the population could be lost in just a few generations. There are many nonbreeding T&#257;iko so DNA sexing was used to examine sex ratios in the population. Almost all unpaired birds were male, which signified a potential Allee effect (i.e. that a reduced density of potential mates is decreasing population productivity). Further understanding of the T&#257;iko mating system and behaviour was obtained by parentage, sibship and pairwise relatedness analyses of genotypes at eight microsatellite DNA loci. It is important that T&#257;iko are found so they can be protected from introduced predators. The results of mitochondrial DNA sequencing and microsatellite DNA genotyping indicated that there are likely to be more T&#257;iko breeding in undiscovered areas. Analysis of philopatry using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers can assist conservation by the identification of areas to search for these undiscovered individuals. T&#257;iko may have once and could still be found on islands near South America since DNA sequencing showed the Magenta Petrel type specimen (collected in 1867 in the South Pacific Ocean) is a T&#257;iko.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chatham Island t&#257;iko</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">genetic variation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270203 Population and ecological genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/657</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological requirements of the New Zealand falcon (Falco novaseelandiae) in plantation forestry : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Seaton, Richard</field><field name="description">Commercial pine plantations made up of exotic tree species are increasingly recognised as habitats that can contribute significantly to the conservation of indigenous biodiversity in New Zealand. Encouraging this biodiversity by employing sympathetic forestry management techniques not only offers benefits for indigenous flora and fauna but can also be economically advantageous for the forestry industry. The New Zealand falcon (Falco novaeseelandiae) or Karearea, is a threatened species, endemic to the islands of New Zealand, that has recently been discovered breeding in pine plantations. This research determines the ecological requirements of New Zealand falcons in this habitat, enabling recommendations for sympathetic forestry management to be made. Plantation forests that create a mosaic of pine stand ages across a plantation, offer suitable habitat for breeding New Zealand falcons by providing abundant nest sites, promoting high abundances of avian prey and creating favourable conditions for hunting. The diet of falcons within pine forests consisted primarily of birds, of which the majority were exotic passerines. Prey abundances were highest along pine stand edges. Both sexes preferentially hunted along pine stand edges between stands less than four years old and stands more than 20 years old. Pairs also preferentially nested along these borders, particularly within and along the edges of pine stands less than two years old. Within pine stands, nest sites were always located on the ground. Introduced predators and some forestry operations negatively affected breeding success. Nevertheless, productivity was higher than recorded for other habitats and female falcons were recorded successfully breeding in their first year for the first time. High prey densities and availabilities are suggested as the primary explanation for this. The extent of juvenile dispersal strongly suggests that pine plantations supplement populations in surrounding areas where falcons are in decline. This research demonstrates that changes to the existing forestry operational practices can influence the success of the breeding population. This research establishes that if commercial pine plantations are suitably managed, they can support extremely high falcon densities. Plantation forests therefore have a significant role to play in the future conservation of this species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand falcon</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">pine plantations</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">forest management</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/658</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and computational analysis of the two-stage capacitated plant location problem : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Decision Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wildbore, Bronwyn Louise</field><field name="description">Mathematical models for plant location problems form an important class of integer and mixed-integer linear programs. The Two-Stage Capacitated Plant Location Problem (TSCPLP), the subject of this thesis, consists of a three level structure: in the first or upper-most level are the production plants, the second or central level contains the distribution depots, and the third level is the customers. The decisions to be made are: the subset of plants and depots to open; the assignment of customers to open depots, and therefore open plants; and the flow of product from the plants to the depots, to satisfy the customers' service or demand requirements at minimum cost. The formulation proposed for the TSCPLP is unique from previous models in the literature because customers can be served from multiple open depots (and plants) and the capacity of both the set of plants and the set of depots is restricted. Surrogate constraints are added to strengthen the bounds from relaxations of the problem. The need for more understanding of the strength of the bounds generated by this procedure for the TSCPLP is evident in the literature. Lagrangian relaxations are chosen based more on ease of solution than the knowledge that a strong bound will result. Lagrangian relaxation has been applied in heuristics and also inserted into branch-and-bound algorithms, providing stronger bounds than traditional linear programming relaxations. The current investigation provides a theoretical and computational analysis of Lagrangian relaxation bounds for the TSCPLP directly. Results are computed through a Lagrangian heuristic and CPLEX. The test problems for the computational analysis cover a range of problem size and strength of capacity constraints. This is achieved by scaling the ratio of total depot capacity to customer demand and the ratio of total plant capacity to total depot capacity on subsets of problem instances. The analysis shows that there are several constraints in the formulation that if dualized in a Lagrangian relaxation provide strong bounds on the optimal solution to the TSCPLP. This research has applications in solution techniques for the TSCPLP and can be extended to some transformations of the TSCPLP. These include the single-source TSCPLP, and the multi-commodity TSCPLP which accommodates for multiple products or services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Lagrangian relaxation bounds</field><field name="subject">linear programming</field><field name="subject">theoretical analysis</field><field name="subject">computational analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230118 Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/660</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in the establishment of a primary health organisation in the Horowhenua : a longitudinal case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lockett-Kay, Janet Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In February 2001 the Minister of Health, in announcing the Primary Health Care Strategy (King, 2001), identified Primary Health Organisations as the vehicles for planning, funding and coordinating primary health care services throughout New Zealand. The requirement that communities be involved in their planning and development was integral to this strategy implementation. Investigation of the Horowhenua Primary Health Organisation establishment process from the inception of planning to the formation of a Primary Health Organisation provided an excellent opportunity to analyse the determinants of genuine community participation. This case study extended over a nine-month period. Data collected from multiple sources provided the basis for investigating the complex notion of community participation and the attributes which are essential for sustainable community engagement. The Horowhenua Primary Health Organisation Steering Committee comprised community representatives, iwi and local health professionals. This group along with the two external stakeholder groups - namely the District Health Board Funding Division and the District Health Board Primary Health Care Reference Group &#8211; were central to the analysis. The events recorded and observations made throughout the planning period formed the basis of identifying essential determinants of community participation. These included knowledge of the community and its unique &#8220;ways of doing&#8221;, the dynamic interdependencies both within the Horowhenua community and with stakeholders external to the Horowhenua, changing power relationships, managing material resourcing and accessibility to essential information. These all influenced how this rural community engaged in Primary Health Organisation planning. One common theme which emerges in the literature is the synergy between community participation and community development. A community development approach is a commonly agreed way of engaging communities in health service planning which is genuine, inclusive, self-reliant, and self-determining. This research demonstrated that the New Zealand context, where implementation of the primary health care strategy must be nationally consistent and comply with prescriptive, central government-determined criteria - as well as involving communities in a meaningful way - requires an alternative approach. The thesis presents a way of addressing power discrepancies, promoting interdependencies between stakeholders and achieving inclusiveness in all decision-making where &#8220;expert&#8221; stakeholders and community bring to the partnership a set of attributes and knowledge which collectively informs the entire planning process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">community health services</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/661</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exiting the matrix : colonisation, decolonisation and social work in Aotearoa : voices of Ng&#257;ti Raukawa ki te Tonga kaimahi wh&#257;nau : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Bell, Hayley Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the potential use of a facilitated process of decolonisation, or whakaw&#257;tea, amongst wh&#257;nau whakapapa in Aotearoa.

Four classes were involved in the study, two classes were taught a programme based on the RM and two classes were taught using a traditional pedagogical approach to physical education. All four classes were taught by the same teacher. A mixed methodological approach was used combining case study and quasi-experimental research. Data were collected through interviews, observations, analysis of detention patterns, and regular student self-assessments. The implementation was successful in developing positive, supportive and well-behaved classes in physical education. The majority of students developed a greater understanding of personal and social responsibility and became more personally and socially responsible in class. The students were not found to be disadvantaged in meeting the physical education curriculum goals and students in the RM classes were found to be more engaged in their class work than the equivalent students in the control classes. If the true measure of success, however, is that students are able to take what is learnt in physical education and apply it in other contexts, then this implementation was less successful. For the vast majority of students the teaching and learning about personal and social responsibility was firmly associated with physical education and they generally showed little understanding of the potential for the transfer of learning to other contexts. It is possible that a longer implementation and a more consistent reinforcement of the concept of transfer would lead to students developing greater understanding of the models potential application in other areas of their lives. This study has implications for teachers who are considering introducing the RM into their teaching. It provides insights into the realities of implementing the RM into the specific context of secondary school physical education programmes. It also challenges the assumptions that teachers may have that the introduction of the RM is a relatively unproblematic process and identifies a number of areas of potential difficulty. The study concludes with recommendations for teachers contemplating introducing the RM into their practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">responsibility model</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">physical education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/663</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the regulation of conidiation in species of Trichoderma</field><field name="creator">Steyaert, Johanna M.</field><field name="description">A characteristic feature of species of Trichoderma is the production of concentric rings of conidia in response to alternating light-dark conditions. In response to a single burst of light, a single ring of conidia forms at what was the colony perimeter. On the basis of these observations, competency to photoconidiate has been proposed to be due to the age and metabolic rate of the hyphal cell. In this study, conidiation was investigated in five biocontrol isolates (T. hamatum, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. virens and T. harzianum) using both a morphological and molecular approach. All five isolates produced concentric conidial rings under alternating light-dark conditions on potato-dextrose agar (PDA), however, in response to a 15 min burst of blue light, only T. asperellum and T. virens produced a clearly, defined conidial ring which correlated with the colony margin at the time of light exposure. Both T. harzianum and T. hamatum photoconidiated in a disk-like fashion and T. atroviride produced a broken ring with a partially filled in appearance. On the basis of these results, it was postulated that competency to photoconidiate is a factor of the metabolic state of the hyphal cell rather than chronological age or metabolic rate. The influence of the source of nitrogen on photoconidiation was assessed on pH-buffered (pH 5.4) minimal medium (MM) amended with glutamine, urea or KNO&#8323;. In the presence of glutamine or urea, T. asperellum and T. harzianum conidiated in a disk, whereas, when KNO&#8323; was the sole nitrogen source, a ring of conidia was produced. Further, in the presence of increasing amounts of glutamine, the clearly defined photoconidial ring produced on PDA by T. asperellum became disk-like. These results clearly demonstrated that primary nitrogen promotes photoconidiation in these isolates and strongly suggests that competency of a hyphal cell to conidiate in response to light is dependent on the nitrogen catabolite repression state of the cell. The experiments were repeated for all five isolates on unbuffered MM. Differences were apparent between the buffered and unbuffered experiments for T. atroviride. No photoconidiation was observed in T. atroviride on buffered medium whereas on unbuffered medium, rings of conidia were produced on both primary and secondary nitrogen. These results show that photoconidiation in T. atroviride is influenced by the buffering capacity of the medium. Conidiation in response to light by T. hamatum and T. virens was absent in all nitrogen experiments, regardless of the nitrogen source and buffering capacity, whereas both isolates conidiated in response to light on PDA. These results imply that either both sources of nitrogen are required for photoconidiation, or a factor essential for conidiation in these two isolates was absent in the minimal medium. Mycelial injury was also investigated in five biocontrol isolates of Trichoderma. On PDA, all isolates except T. hamatum conidiated in response to injury. On nitrogen amended MM, conidiation in response to injury was again observed in all isolates except for T. hamatum. In T. atroviride, injury-induced conidiation was observed on all medium combinations except the pH-buffered MM amended with glutamine or urea and T. virens conidiated in response to injury on primary nitrogen only, regardless of the buffering capacity. These results have revealed conidiation in response to injury to be differentially regulated between isolates/species of Trichoderma. On unbuffered MM amended with glutamine or urea, conidiation in response to injury occurred at the colony perimeter only in T. atroviride. It was hypothesised that the restriction of conidiation to the perimeter may be due to changes in the pH of the agar. The experiment was repeated and the pH values of the agar under the growing colony measured at the time of light induction (48 h) or injury (72 h). The areas under the hyphal fronts were acidified to below the starting value of the medium (pH 5.4) and the centres of the plates were alkalinised. The region of acidification at the time of stimuli correlated with the production of conidia, which implicates a role for crossregulation of conidiation by the ambient pH. The influence of the ambient pH on injury-induced conidiation was investigated in T. hamatum and T. atroviride on MM amended with glutamine and PDA, pH-buffered from pH 2.8 to 5.6. Thickening of the hyphae around the injury site was observed at the lowest pH values on MM in both T. atroviride and T. hamatum, however no conidia were produced, whereas both Trichoderma species conidiated on pH-buffered PDA in a strictly low pH-dependent fashion. This is the first observation of injury-induced conidiation in T. hamatum. The influence of the ambient pH on photoconidiation was assessed in T. hamatum, T. atroviride and T. harzianum using both buffered and unbuffered PDA from pH 2.8 to 5.2. On buffered PDA, no conidiation in response to light was observed above pH 3.2 in T. hamatum, above 4.0 in T. atroviride and above 4.4 in T. harzianum, whereas on unbuffered PDA it occurred at all pH values tested. It was postulated that conidiation at pH values above 4.4 on unbuffered PDA was due to acidification of the agar. The pH values of the agar under the growing colony were measured at the time of light exposure and in contrast to the MM with glutamine experiments, alkalisation of the agar had occurred in both T. atroviride and T. hamatum. No change in medium pH was recorded under the growing T. harzianum colony. These results indicate that low pH-dependence of photoconidiation is directly related to the buffering capacity of the medium. Recent studies have linked regulation of conidiation in T. harzianum to Pac1, the PacC orthologue. In fungi, PacC regulates gene expression in response to the ambient pH. In these studies pH-dependent photoconidiation occurred only on buffered PDA and on unbuffered PDA conidiation occurred at significantly higher ambient pH levels. It is proposed that the influence of ambient pH on conidiation in the isolates used in this study is not due to direct Pac1 regulation. The T. harzianum isolate used in this study produced profuse amounts of the yellow anthraquinone pachybasin. Production of this secondary metabolite was strictly pH-dependent, irrespective of the buffering capacity of the medium. Studies in T. harzianum have linked Pac1 regulation to production of an antifungal &#945;-pyrone. pH-dependence on both buffered and unbuffered media strongly suggests that pachybasin production may also be under the control of Pac1. Photoconidiation studies on broth-soaked filter paper, revealed rhythmic conidiation in the pachybasin producing T. harzianum isolate. Diffuse rings of conidia were produced in dark-grown cultures and, in cultures exposed to light for 15 min at 48 h, the rings were clearly defined. These results show that conidiation is under the control of an endogenous rhythm in T. harzianum and represent the first report of circadian conidiation in a wild-type Trichoderma. A Free-Running Rhythm (FRR) assay was used to investigate rhythmic gene expression in T. atroviride IMI206040 and a mutant derivative, in which the wc-2 orthologue, blr-2, was disrupted. Over a 3 d period, expression of gpd, which encodes the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, oscillated with a period of about 48 h. In the &#916;blr-2 mutant, the gpd rhythm was absent. These results revealed that in T. atroviride, gpd expression is under the control of an endogenous clock and that clock-regulated expression of gpd is associated with a functional BLR complex. Using degenerate primers, a portion of frq, which encodes the N. crassa clock oscillator FREQUENCY, was isolated from T. atroviride and used to probe the FRR assay northern blots. No frq expression was detected at any time point, which suggests that the circadian clock in Trichoderma does not involve FREQUENCY. In a concurrent study, orthologues of rco-1 (rcoT) were isolated and sequenced from T. atroviride and T. hamatum using a combination of degenerate, inverse and specific PCR. RcoT is an orthologue of the yeast global co-repressor Tup1 and in the filamentous fungi, RcoT orthologues have been demonstrated to negatively regulate conidiation. Genomic analysis of all available rcoT orthologues revealed the conservation of erg3, a major ergosterol biosynthesis gene, upstream from rcoT in ascomycetous filamentous fungi, but not in the ascomycetous yeast or in the basidiomycetes. These studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of the regulatory factors controlling conidiation in Trichoderma and have multiple implications for Trichoderma biocontrol; most notable the promotion of conidiation by primary nitrogen and low pH. Incubation conditions can be altered to suit the nitrogen and pH preferences of a biocontrol strain in order to promote cost effective conidial production, however this is not easily achieved in the soil, where the biocontrol strain must perform in a highly buffered environment optimised for plant growth. Successful use of Trichoderma biocontrol strains may involve the screening and targeting of strains to the appropriate pH conditions or the selection of new strains on the basis of capacity to perform under a given range of conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichoderma</field><field name="subject">conidiation</field><field name="subject">nitrogen catabolite repression</field><field name="subject">pH regulation</field><field name="subject">anthraquinone</field><field name="subject">pachybasin</field><field name="subject">circadian</field><field name="subject">free-running rhythm</field><field name="subject">blr-1</field><field name="subject">frq</field><field name="subject">gpd</field><field name="subject">rcoT</field><field name="subject">erg3</field><field name="subject">con-10</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270305 Mycology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/544</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of past and future vegetation change for the lizard fauna of Motunau Island</field><field name="creator">Bannock, C. A.</field><field name="description">Abundance, distribution and habitat preferences of the lizard species present on Motunau Island, off the Canterbury coast of New Zealand, were investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the extent to which recent vegetation change on Motunau Island has effected the lizard community and what implications this has for the future management of the Island. Three species of lizard occur on Motunau Island; the common gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus), common skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma) and spotted skink (O. lineoocellatum). Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were present on the island from 1862 until their eradication in 1962. Since then, vegetation on the island has changed from being tussock-dominated to being dominated by exotic weeds. Data from lizard pitfall trap surveys carried out in 1967-75 by Tony Whitaker of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) were compared with new pitfall trapping data to determine if changes in the lizard population had occurred in response to these vegetation changes. The abundance of O. n. polychroma and H. maculatus does not appear to change significantly. The distribution of these two species were significantly correlated but neither showed any preference for a particular type. The abundance of O. lineoocellatum was significantly greater in 1996/97 than in the earlier DSlR surveys. This could be a result of the vegetation becoming more open and more structurally complex since the early surveys. This would offer greater opportunities for O. lineoocellatum (which is strongly heliothermic) to thermoregulate and forage. O. lineoocellatum showed no consistent significant preference towards any habitat type, although they tended to be found more in 'margin' habitat. Research into pitfall trapping and the way lizard behaviour may influence pitfall trapping data needs to be undertaken as there is a possible trap bias in this study. Management of Motunau Island needs to ensure that a structurally complex environment is maintained to ensure high numbers of all three lizard species can continue to coexist.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">common gecko</field><field name="subject">Hoplodactylus maculatus</field><field name="subject">common skink</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</field><field name="subject">spotted skink</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma lineoocellafum</field><field name="subject">Motunau Island</field><field name="subject">vegetation change</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"They're not including us!" : neighbourhood deprivation and older adults' leisure time physical activity participation</field><field name="creator">Annear, M. J.</field><field name="description">Population ageing and the tendency for older adults to have poorer health status than younger adults have raised concerns about potential increases in the number of elderly suffering disease and disability. Significantly, many health problems experienced in later life are associated with the onset of a more sedentary lifestyle. Increasing older adults' participation in leisure time physical activity (henceforth LTPA) offers an opportunity to reduce the prevalence of preventable morbidity in later life and offset a potential burden of ageing on the public health sector. As a forerunner to the development of strategies to increase older adults' LTPA participation, researchers have investigated the intrapersonal, interpersonal and, to a lesser extent, environmental influences on this health behaviour. Recent findings from studies of the adult population have suggested that neighbourhood deprivation, a measure of the socioeconomic conditions of small areas, may significantly influence LTPA participation. Extending previous findings, this research investigated how neighbourhood deprivation influenced older adults' LTPA participation. A total of 63 older adults were recruited from high- and low-deprivation neighbourhoods in Christchurch, New Zealand. Neighbourhoods were selected because of their relative positions on the New Zealand Deprivation Index and were characterised by the researcher as "East-town", a neighbourhood of high deprivation, and "West-town", a neighbourhood of low deprivation. The research incorporated a cross-sectional, comparative and mixed-methods approach. The methods of enquiry employed in this research included a recall survey, Q method, and semi-structured interviewing. Each method addressed a different aspect of the primary research question and provided data that was used in the creation of an integrated model depicting the influence of neighbourhood deprivation on older adults' LTPA participation.  The results derived from the three research methods showed that older adults from the low-deprivation neighbourhood of West-town participated in LTPA more frequently than older adults from the high-deprivation neighbourhood of East-town. East-town was identified as having many physical and social environmental constraints to LTPA and comparatively few facilitators. Alternatively, West-town was found to have many physical and social environmental facilitators to LTPA and relatively few constraints. Neighbourhood attributes which appeared to influence older adults' LTPA participation included appropriateness of leisure provision, neighbourhood attractiveness, walkability, traffic, and perceptions of crime and antisocial behaviour. One implication of this research is that environmental interventions should be considered in attempts to engage older adults in LTPA for health purposes, particularly in high-deprivation neighbourhoods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population ageing</field><field name="subject">older adult</field><field name="subject">compression of morbidity</field><field name="subject">leisure time physical activity</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood deprivation</field><field name="subject">physical environment</field><field name="subject">social environment</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/468</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Practice and...</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This Ph.D. by Publication essay organises my work in four sections: Between Practice and Research; Between Practice and Clinical/Operational Management; Between Practice and Policy; and Between Practice and the Public. A context-setting introduction puts the work in the temporal frame of the 1960's through 2001 and announces the point of view taken on nursing: the reason for the existence of the modern health care delivery system is to provide nursing care. In the first section, the publications deal with the development of clinical nursing research methods.  My particular effort was to conceptualise the relationship between nursing practice and research.  The publications show how that relationship was actualised. The second section contains work done 20 years or so after that reported in the first section, but the work is closely related.  Here, the publications deal with the extension of the notion of nursing practice research to clinical/operational management using the rich administrative data produced by casemix (Diagnosis Related Groups - DRGs). This body of work reveals nursing as resource.  The third section holds literature review and policy analysis that provide the contexts for nursing practice.  Publications deal particularly with the 'expanded role' of nursing as nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife and nurse anesthetist.  Research and policy are knit together in this section. In the fourth section, I connect nursing to public forums. The concluding section draws together the themes that have occurred throughout: valuing nursing and making the discipline visible and credible in terms the world understands.  The thesis ends with a metaphor that makes research, operations and policy one with public practice: nursing as craft.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing research</field><field name="subject">Nursing history</field><field name="subject">Nursing literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/233</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hello, ruel World</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The analytic component of the thesis approaches major questions in Cultural Studies, Philosophy and Social Theory through an investigation of various forms of creative practice.  I approach the question of agency, for instance, through a study of stage actors, who must recite set lines, and yet feel empowered precisely by the opportunity to act through them.  Investigation of the author's own work as a poet and novelist serves to cast light upon ideology, ie. how one might use a constrained language and yet feel empowered to speak new things through it.  I apply these investigations to Althusser, whose famous essay on the total power of ideological interpellation is permeated  with theatrical metaphor.  I suggest that Althusser is repressing the creative component of everyday life, something social theory has ever found hard to theorise.  I proceed to suggest that the place where such processes are analysed is in the philosophy of science. The work of Charles Saunders Peirce on the experimental method is, my investigation uncovers, surprisingly geared toward the investigation of creativity.  In science one has a method for, and an extensive literature on, discovering new phenomena.  My thesis is that the experimental method of modern scientists, and the creative method of modern writers, both geared toward the production of things that are at once new and true, is largely the same.  I use Peircean semiotics to argue that creative composition is about listening to the languages spoken all round you, and transcribing their objective contours.  So as to have effect on others.  Which is just like science.  And in both instances we are endlessly spoken through at every moment by the myriad languages which interpellate us.  Whence creativity (for those who are open to it).  My three portfolio pieces are:  Cube Root of Book: a series of one hundred and thirty two poems set at intervals along the descending spiral of a Fibonacci number sequence.

Unaustralia, a Study of Heads, an attempt to show the relevance of these findings to Cultural Studies and other related practices.  It centres on my new reading of Althusser, and is flanked by mini-ethnographies of creative practice, including the above.  The poetry is presented as a major new creative work.

CSC Index study (in CIO Enterprise, July 1998) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems promise to revolutionise the way a business operates: allowing greater flexibility, market responsiveness, customer service, management information and reduced costs. However experiences and opinions vary dramatically as to whether ERP systems deliver on these promises. Certainly ERP systems customer demand remains strong, with major ERP systems vendors experiencing several years of double-digit growth and better, with a whole sub-industry of consultants and systems integrators growing around ERP system. This study examines the strategic nature and implications of the ERP systems decision: in reality a multitude of decisions, which together have drastic and lasting effects on nearly all aspects of an organisation. As with all strategic issues, there is no `step-by-step recipe for success' with ERP, but rather a successful approach depends on the specific organisation and its environment. Therefore what is required is an assessment and analysis of these, the results of which are combined with established knowledge about IT systems development and implementation to determine the most suitable approach. In this way ERP is integrated with organisational strategy and therefore can achieve maximum benefit. If ERP is not viewed and managed as a strategic project, it is likely, at best, to be a massive waste of resources and, at worst, may cripple an organisation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing resource planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/235</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Friend or Intruder? Living with an Implantable Defibrillator: Patients' and Partners' Experiences.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a reliable, cost-effective implanted device designed to terminate life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and prevent sudden death. The recent exponential increase in implantation rates emphasises the need for nurses, doctors and other clinicians to understand the experience of living with an ICD for patients and partners. Current knowledge of patient experiences is mostly derived from overseas studies of specific variables, including physical problems, psychosocial outcomes, ICD shocks and quality of life issues. Studies of partner experiences focus on psychosocial concerns. Using van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic phenomenological approach, this study describes the experience of living with an ICD for seven Australian patients and six partners.  Experiential descriptions, obtained in tape-recorded conversational interviews, were subjected to three levels of analysis. The first descriptive analysis summarised individual experiences of living with an ICD. The second, thematic analysis phenomenologically described the collective lived experience of being a patient, and of being a partner. Each description identified a challenging and changing experience through the themes of Being Disrupted and Distressed, Reconstructing Life, Appreciating and Celebrating Life, and Accommodating the ICD. For the patient, various everyday interactions, events and activities meant either being able to trust the ICD as a reassuring protection or experiencing it as an inescapable intrusive object. For the partner, a trusting reliance on the ICD's protective security eased the vulnerability and onerous perceived responsibility for the patient's survival and well-being. Threats to the partner's restored sense of normality, security and hope occurred when the patient wanted the ICD removed or discontinued. The third hermeneutic analysis specifically explored how the ICD, as an implanted biomedical device, was perceived, embodied and comprehended by patients. This analysis disclosed the varied, ambiguous existential meanings derived from and accorded to the ICD's presence, power and potential. The interpretation concluded that the ICD was either embodied as a trusted and reassuring friend, or existentially rejected as an intruder that thwarted meaningful possibilities. Theoretical and practical implications of this understanding of living with an ICD included several recommendations for improving staff education, as well as practical interventions for informing and supporting patients and partners. A proposal for implementing these recommendations concluded with suggestions for future inquiries that would extend understanding of this increasingly common human phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/236</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We Love To Hate Help Desk</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Customer satisfaction with the Information Technology Help Desk is the focus of this study. Technology in the workplace has increased exponentially. Therefore customers are more reliant on the Help Desk then ever before. This has raised the importance of the role that Help Desk plays in the functioning of an organisation.  The fundamental aim of this study is to answer  the questions below;  1. Is dissatisfaction truly present for individual problems, or is it a generalisation or "urban myth"?  2. Which of the five hypotheses are the most significant in causing dissatisfaction amongst customers? The five hypotheses focus on the areas of Communication, Solutions, Service, Knowledge (up-to-date), and Morale.  A computer-based survey was used to query the customers. The survey questions linked back to the hypotheses. The customer was given the opportunity to make an optional comment to discover any sensitive issues that the survey did not address.  The average "overall satisfaction" rating for the survey suggested the general population is more satisfied then dissatisfied with the services of the Help Desk. From the study I was able to conclude that dissatisfaction is present for individual problems, but the dissatisfied customer only accounts for 8% of the surveyed population.  Having proven that customer dissatisfaction is present the next step was to determine the nature of the problem to provide useful information to reduce customer dissatisfaction. Investigating the surveys on the basis of problem category did this.  The results indicated that customer dissatisfaction was most prevalent in calls concerning changes made to PCs and server interruptions. Therefore the Help Desk needs to re-evaluate the processes for handling problems of this nature. In contrast customers were most satisfied with assistance for problems relating to desktop software and hardware. Therefore dissatisfaction is not an "urban myth".  Of all the five hypotheses, Help Desk morale stood out as producing more satisfaction than any of the other hypotheses including "overall satisfaction". Help Desk morale proved to be significantly different in nature when compared to the four other hypotheses. Therefore the moral of the Help Desk team is a fundamental ingredient for brewing a successful service. Get this wrong and all aspects of the team and the service will decline.  The most important influence on "overall satisfaction" was "satisfaction with keeping up with technological change", and the least important factor was "satisfaction with ability to predict problems through good communication". This would indicate an up-to-date Help Desk is more likely to have satisfied customers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="subject">Computer industry.</field><field name="subject">Customer services.</field><field name="subject">Management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/237</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holistic aspects of rehabilitation post cardiac surgery in the Bonny method of guided imagery and music.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis has set out to investigate the role of music therapy in the form of the specialist Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) with a view to exploring how meanings related to adjustment from a health crisis (such as cardiac surgery) are depicted in music-supported imagery. Factors shaping clinical interpretations of verbal and musical responses in music therapy practice are often unclear or undelineated. A systematic interpretive process relevant to clinical health care was developed using the Bonny Method of Guide Imagery and Music (GIM), providing a means for exploring the emotional difficulties of coronary bypass patients, who typically recover quickly from physical surgery but often experience residual symptoms such as depression, pain, and anxiety. The interpretive process accessed both verbal and non-verbal texts, playing them against each other in order to find significance for music therapy practice in rehabilitation. A Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) series was undertaken by patients recovering from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with each session audiotaped and transcribed. This narrative data was analyzed thematically, and grand themes were used to focus further intertextual (semiotic) and Jungian perspectives, in the process of deriving substantial clinical meanings. Results suggested that participants used a wide range of personal, cultural and archetypal texts to convey meanings about their health care situation, including images of the music during the therapeutic process. Clinical change in the rehabilitative process was suggested by grand themes comprising 'Looking through the frame', 'Feeling the impact', 'Spiralling into the unexpected', 'Sublime plateau', and 'Rehearsing new steps' and the further music-related grand theme of 'Sounding the changes'. This project highlights the value of GIM as a vehicle to track clinical change with cardiac patients, based on a systematic interpretive process sensitive to the interweaving verbal and nonverbal texts evident in the music therapy context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music therapy</field><field name="subject">Postoperative care</field><field name="subject">Heart</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/238</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation and change in university teachers' ways of experiencing teaching</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores how university teachers'  ways of experiencing teaching change from teacher focused to student focused and why some teachers experience this change while others do not.  The exploration adopts the theoretical perspective of variation, learning and awareness (Marton and Booth, 1997) and is based on a two-year longitudinal interview study of 27 university teachers.  Classical and new phenomenographies were used to constitute teachers' ways of experiencing teaching and teachers' ways of experiencing change in teaching.  Changes in individual teachers' ways of experiencing were described and interpreted through focusing on teachers' awareness of critical aspects and related dimensions of variation, creating individual vignettes, and constituting themes in the critical experiences and orientations related to change.  The outcomes included six ways of experiencing teaching and their complementary patterns of critical aspects, a set of themes related to change in ways of experiencing and five ways of experiencing change in teaching.  Combining these outcomes resulted in four patterns which illuminated why some teachers' ways of experiencing teaching became student focused while others remained teacher focused.  Teachers who became capable of experiencing teaching in student-focused ways focused on understanding teaching in relation to students' learning.  They experienced change in teaching as becoming more student-focused or as relating teaching to development or change in student understandings, and were oriented towards putting teaching into focus and reflecting in ways informed by formal learning.  These teachers experienced relevance structures which brought the critical aspects of student-focused ways of experiencing teaching to the foreground of their awareness so that they experienced corresponding dimensions of variation.  Their awareness of teaching expanded and this corresponded to a shift in the focus and meaning of teaching.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College teaching.</field><field name="subject">Teachers.</field><field name="subject">Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/239</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working the knowledge game? The power of the everyday in managing truth in organsations.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis focuses on what I have called truth management.  First it traces how modernist and postmodern theorists play their versions of what counts as true.  A key critique I stage of modernist theorising is that it privileges decontextualised ways of knowing and silences agency.  Drawn from postmodern concerns and my critique of 'normal science', two maps of 'thinking tools' (Bourdieu 1992) are proposed as the basis of my theorising of how truth is managed in organisations.  The first map aims to position contextualism within the empirical gaze.  It is made up of three contingencies - discourses, time and space.  The second map of thinking tools aims to bring agency back into view.  It is made up of four contingencies - identity, capital, practices and power.  Each of the seven contingencies is used to frame the story of an inter-organisational partnership between an Australian university and a financial institution in part two of the thesis.  The story traces their engagement in a negotiated postgraduate degree program - the Work-Based Learning (WBL) program from 1996-2003.  In this way, I aim to demonstrate the power of everyday decision making in determining what counts as true.  The management of truth is seen to be dynamic, multiple and contingent rather than causal, singular and able to be plotted on a linear trajectory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Truth</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/240</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the Erodibility of Earth Wall Units</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This investigation looked at the climatic variables affecting the durability of earth buildings and the relationship between these climatic variables and their laboratory counterparts, with the aim of providing a means whereby performance in the field under known climatic conditions can be predicted by performance in the laboratory.  The investigation showed that the major climatic factors influencing the erosion of earth walls due to wind-driven rain are impacting rainfall volume, drop impact velocity (as determined by wind conditions), raindrop size and duration of rainfall. A vertical rain gauge was calibrated with climatic conditions at a test site in Sydney to enable accurate prediction of the volume of water impacting test specimens. In the laboratory, a standard spray test was modified by introducing a commercially available nozzle, which produces a turbulent spray of individual drops, rather than a stream of water. Erosion rates using this apparatus were found to vary significantly with time, and a correction formula was derived from experimental results to enable comparison to be made between field and laboratory results. Erosion rates per unit volume of water were found to be proportional to impacting velocity raised to the power 2.5 and inversely proportional to the median drop diameter raised to the power 1.2. A material factor was defined as the 60 minute erosion mass loss divided by the 60 minute volume of impacting water spray. Field tests were carried out over a period of four years and analysed in relation to the associated laboratory test results. Laboratory testing was carried out on one half of split specimens, the other half being subjected to exposure to the weather at Sydney's International Airport, with regular monitoring of wind and rain records.  An empirical model was developed and was used to compare field and laboratory results.  This confirmed the importance of impacting volume of water and material factor but in this case the calculated correlation between field and laboratory erosions was not improved by the addition of impact velocity and drop size terms.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earth Construction</field><field name="subject">Materials</field><field name="subject">Deterioration</field><field name="subject">Erosion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/241</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gaseous Secondary Electron Detection and Cascade Amplification in the Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis quantitatively investigates gaseous electron-ion recombination in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) at a transient level by utilizing the dark shadows/streaks seen in gaseous secondary electron detector (GSED) images immediately after a region of enhanced secondary electron (SE) emission is encountered by a scanning electron beam. The investigation firstly derives a theoretical model of gaseous electron-ion recombination that takes into consideration transients caused by the time constant of the GSED electronics and external circuitry used to generate images. Experimental data of pixel intensity versus time of the streaks is then simulated using the model enabling the relative magnitudes of (i) ionization and recombination rates, (ii) recombination coefficients, and (iii) electron drift velocities, as well as absolute values of the total time constant of the detection system, to be determined as a function of microscope operating parameters. Results reveal the exact dependence that the effects of SE-ion recombination on signal formation have on reduced electric field intensity and time in ESEM. Furthermore, the model implicitly demonstrates that signal loss as a consequence of field retardation due to ion space charges, although obviously present, is not the foremost phenomenon causing streaking in images, as previously thought. Following that the generation and detection of gaseous scintillation and electro- luminescence produced via electron-gas molecule excitation reactions in ESEM is investigated. Here a novel gaseous scintillation detection (GSD) system is developed to efficiently detect photons produced. Images acquired using GSD are compared to those obtained using conventional GSED detection, and demonstrate that images rich in SE contrast can be achieved using such systems. A theoretical model is developed that describes the generation of photon signals by cascading SEs, high energy backscattered electrons (BSEs) and primary beam electrons (PEs). Photon amplification, or the total number of photons produced per sample emissive electron, is then investigated, and compared to conventional electronic amplification, over a wide range of microscope operating parameters, imaging gases and photon collection geometries. The main findings of the investigation revealed that detected electroluminescent signals exhibit larger SE signal-to-background levels than that of conventional electronic signals detected via GSED. Also, dragging the electron cascade towards the light pipe assemblage of GSD systems, or electrostatic focusing, dramatically increases photon collection efficiencies. The attainment of such an improvement being a direct consequence of increasing the `effective' solid angle for photon collection. Finally, in attempt to characterize the scintillating wavelengths arising from sample emissive SEs, PEs, BSEs, and their respective cascaded electrons, such that future photon filtering techniques can be employed to extract nominated GSD imaging signals, the emission spectra of commonly utilized electroluminescent gases in ESEM, such as argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2), were collected and investigated. Spectra of Ar and N2 reveal several major emission lines that occur in the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The major photon emissions discovered in Ar are attributed to occur via atomic de-excitation transitions of neutral Ar (Ar I), whilst for N2, major emissions are attributed to be a consequence of second positive band vibrational de-excitation reactions. Major wavelength intensity versus gas pressure data, for both Ar and N2, illustrate that wavelength intensities increase with decreasing pressure. This phenomenon strongly suggesting that quenching effects and reductions in excitation mean free paths increase with imaging gas pressure.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron microscope</field><field name="subject">scanning</field><field name="subject">cascade</field><field name="subject">signal loss</field><field name="subject">gaseous</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/242</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Strategic Management of International Entrepreneurial Activities at Australian Universities</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Universities around the world are increasingly focusing on entrepreneurial activities.  In Australia, the growth of international entrepreneurial activities has resulted in the creation of a billion-dollar export-oriented sector.  These activities include the recruitment of international students to Australian campuses, the development of Australian university campuses in offshore locations, and the delivery of Australian degree programs at both onshore and offshore locations in partnership with universities, professional associations and private corporations.  Australian universities currently receive on average around seven percent of revenues from these sources, with some depending on international entrepreneurialism for as much as one-third of revenues.  Managing these activities in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner has thus become critically important to virtually every institution in the Australian higher education sector.  Long dependent on government funding, Australian universities have found the rise of international entrepreneurialism a significant shift.  As is the case when businesses become international, universities are faced with the need to manage the complexities, risks and challenges associated with international operations.  To date, little empirical work has been undertaken which explores and examines how Australian universities are managing their international entrepreneurial business operations.  The aim of this study is thus to respond to this research gap by exploring how Australian universities, particularly in terms of their Faculties of Business, organise and manage international entrepreneurial activities.  The research examines management approaches, practices and processes at five Australian universities.  Two are highly international, metropolitan universities recognised around the world as leaders in international entrepreneurialism.  Two are smaller, regional institutions, while the fifth  university is a medium-sized metropolitan institution which had in recent times moved aggressively to develop its international activities.  Document analysis, observation and interviews with senior institutional managers, academic managers and academics at each university revealed several common themes arising in institutional approaches.  These included an emphasis on diversified, offshore growth; a degree of movement towards structural centralisation, particularly in the highly international universities which had been historically highly decentralised; the presence of generally supportive organisational cultures; a perception among academic managers and academics that most international activities remain driven by financial imperatives; the perceived potential for detrimental impacts on academic research arising from increased involvement in international activities; the existence of a common concern among senior institutional managers for the effects of Faculty of Business dominance of international programs in their institutions; a tendency for most organisational learning to be informal, except in the highly international institutions; and a preference for decentralised strategic leadership which included a degree of oversight by internationally experienced senior institutional managers.  A Strategic Advantage Model of Internationalisation is presented representing a theoretical and conceptual synthesis of the findings.  Building on previous work undertaken in the field, the model focuses on the need for institutions to achieve best practice and competitive advantage through the leveraging of organisational and strategic competencies, the pursuit of executional advantages, the implementation of strategically decentralised leadership and the development of international business competencies.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">International Business Enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/243</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating Place in Colonial Darwin. Interactions between Aborigines and Whites 1869-1911</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis draws on the documentary historical record to examine the interactions between the indigenous Larrakia people and the white settlers in the colonial township of Darwin between the years 1869 and 1911.  The colonial recognition of the Larrakia as the traditional owners of lands in the Darwin region and the historical question of their land rights is discussed in some detail.  Rather than seeing interactions between the Larrakia and the colonisers as polarised into either accommodation or resistance, this thesis looks at various interactions to highlight the complexities of the encounter.  One of the more complex of their interactions was the negotiation of what is best described as an abstruse alliance which benefited both the Larrakia and the colonisers in various ways.  The colonisation of the Darwin region had a considerable impact on the Larrakia people's ability to live on their country as they had done prior to the invasion.  This thesis seeks to understand the negotiations, compromises and decisions the Larrakia made to survive in their changing landscape.  Another complexity that is highlighted in this thesis is the tension within the white settler population about how to deal with what was presented as the 'Aboriginal problem'.  This thesis shows that the ideology of compensating Aboriginal people for having invaded their land and undermining their means of subsistence was understood and condoned by the colonisers.  The distribution of government rations, the allocation of reserves and the ongoing recognition of the Larrakia's right to be within the township were all ways that some colonisers attempted to compensate Aborigines for invading their land.  This thesis shows that while the Larrakia people were recognised as the prior occupants of Darwin and, as such, accorded a distinct status within the township in the whole period under study, the colonisers ultimately failed to give tangible expression to the Larrakia's land rights.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Darwin (N.T)</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/244</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contingency planning models for Government agencies</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This report describes a research study into the current situation within Federal, State Government and selected private sector agencies, assessing contingency plans for Information Systems and suggests models for state-wide planning against Information Systems disasters. Following a brief look at various phases of contingency plan development, the study looks into the factors that prompt organisations to prepare contingency plans. The project involved a survey of current Information Systems contingency plans in the government agencies in the states of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory. It also included two major banks, an insurance company and two computer services bureaux in the private sector within New South Wales. The survey determined that particular factors play important roles in the decision by organisations to commence contingency planning. These include actual disaster experience, senior management support, auditor's comments, legal requirements, risk analysis and business impact study, economic considerations, insurance requirements, contract commitment, new staff and introduction of new hardware and software. The critical success factors in contingency planning include regular maintenance and testing of the plan. The project also discusses the current contingency planning environment within New South Wales Government agencies and suggests cost-effective models for state-wide adoption.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Security measures</field><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Administrative agencies</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/245</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daunorubicin Kinetics and Drug Resistance in Leukaemia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to examine: (1) plasma and cellular pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and its major metabolite daunorubicinol in patients with acute leukaemia, and the relationships between pharmacokinetics, patient response and the presence of P glycoprotein; (2) actions of the multidrug resistance reversing agents cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine, at clinically achievable concentrations, on daunorubicin accumulation and retention in human leukaemia cell lines and patients with acute leukaemia; and (3) effect of daunorubicin on the cell membrane of both sensitive and resistant cell lines, with and without the multidrug resistance reversing agents. Twenty-seven patients with acute leukaemia received daunorubicin as part of induction therapy. The plasma and cellular levels of daunorubicin and its metabolite daunorubicinol were determined using HPLC. There were no significant differences between patients who went into complete remission (12 out of 23) compared to those who did not respond for any of the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters. There was a significant difference in the cellular daunorubicin and daunorubicinol area under the concentration-time curve between responders and non responders (p less than 0.02), as well as in cellular Cmax, cellular clearance and cellular volume of distribution. Eleven patients were P glycoprotein positive and 10 P glycoprotein negative (no sample available for 2 patients). There was no correlation between patient response and the presence of P glycoprotein; nor a correlation between the cellular concentration of daunorubicin or daunorubicinol and P glycoprotein. Patients responding to chemotherapy had higher cellular daunorubicin and daunorubicinol compared to non responders. In contrast to in vitro studies, overexpression of P glycoprotein was not the reason for the lower cellular daunorubicin levels. Cyclosporin A was capable of increasing both cellular accumulation and retention in the drug resistant CEM/VLB and HL 60/ADR cell lines, but not in the drug sensitive CEM and HL 60 cell lines. Trifluoperazine had no effect in any of the four cell lines. In contrast to the cell line findings, only the combination of cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine were able to increase both accumulation and retention in the blast cells of patients at initial presentation. The multidrug resistant reversing agents alone had no effect in increasing accumulation or retention in the blast cells of P glycoprotein positive patients, nor patients in relapse. The cell line studies show that at clinically relevant concentrations only cyclosporin A is capable of increasing daunorubicin accumulation in both the drug resistant P glycoprotein positive (VLB) and P glycoprotein negative (ADR) cell lines. Thus, cyclosporin A does not work only by inhibiting the actions of P glycoprotein. Trifluoperazine was unable to reverse drug resistance at clinically relevant concentrations in either cell lines or patient blast cells. However, the combination of cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine increased accumulation in patient blast cells at initial presentation, suggesting that these agents may be more useful in patients at initial presentation than relapse.  Daunorubicin was immobilised by linking it to poly vinyl alcohol and the effect of immobilised-daunorubicin was studied on the four cell lines above. The immobilised-daunorubicin was able to decrease cell growth in the drug sensitive HL 60 cell line but not in the drug resistant VLB or ADR cell lines. Poly vinyl alcohol itself was cytotoxic to the CEM cell line. The multidrug resistance reversing agents cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine were only capable of increasing cytotoxicity in the HL 60 cell line, with no effect in the drug resistant VLB or ADR cell lines.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Acute Leukaemia - Treatment</field><field name="subject">daunorubicin</field><field name="subject">cyclosporin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/247</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical Study of a Rotary Valve Internal Combustion Engine</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the Bishop Rotary Valve (BRV) engine is developed. The simulation used an existing commercial CFD code, CFX 4.3, with a number of new routines written to allow it to simulate the conditions and motions involved in an internal combustion engine. The code is extensively validated using results from other researchers, and several new validations are performed to directly validate the code for simulating internal combustion engine flows. Firstly, tumble vortex breakdown during the compression stroke of a square piston model engine is modelled. The results of the simulation are validated against published high quality experimental data. Both two- and three-dimensional models are tested, using the k-e and Reynolds stress turbulence models. The Reynolds stress turbulence model simulations successfully predicted the tumble break down process during the compression stroke. A simple three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulation model is also presented. The numerical simulation is then applied to the BRV engine. An in-cylinder flow field not previously described is discovered, created by the unique combustion chamber shape of the BRV engine. The flow field is not adequately described by the traditional descriptions of engine flows, being squish, swirl and tumble. The new flow structure is named 'dual cross tumble', and is characterised by two counter-rotating vortices in the cross tumble plane on either side of the inlet air jet. Analysis of the dual tumble structure indicates that it is most beneficial in high bore to stroke ratio engines. This flow structure has been predicted or visualised by a small number of previous researchers, however no published research has recognised its significance or potential benefits. The validated code is then used to predict the effect of modifying the valve cross sectional area, the effect of the inlet manifold wave, the effect of heat transfer from the inlet manifold walls, the effect of bore to stroke ratio, and the effect of engine speed. This work presents a numerical simulation of a new rotary valve engine technology. This opens up a whole new area of engine aerodynamics research as no detailed examination of the flows in a rotary valve engine have been presented previously. In the process, it discovers a new compression stroke turbulence generation mechanism, 'dual cross tumble', which offers the potential of performance levels not possible using poppet valve engines.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internal Combustion Engines</field><field name="subject">Mathematical Models</field><field name="subject">Fluid Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Valves</field><field name="subject">Design and Construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/248</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Glittering Thread: The 1954 Royal Tour of Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is a broadly-based historical study of the 1954 Royal Tour of Australia. In presenting an anatomy of this important but neglected event, it attempts to restore its place in history, to explain the nature of the enduring popular attachment to the British Royal Family, to examine the self-portrait that Australia presented to its Royal visitors in the post-war era and to investigate the political and cultural processes by which it did so. The primary theoretical aim of this detailed case study is to interrogate the means by which the State (represented by the Parliament and the state and federal bureaucracies, with the cooperation of the media) was able to secure the willing participation of an overwhelming majority of the population. The elements of this study are drawn principally from government archives, the vast media coverage of the day, extensive oral history interviews with participants, and academic literature in the areas of Australian history (with particular reference to the nineteen-fifties), popular royalism, popular culture, public memory, civic ritual and spectacle. It was my final objective that these elements and aims might be synthesised into an enjoyable, 'popular' account of this chaotic, surprising and memorable event.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visits of State</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Royal Visitors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/249</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Eye of The Storm. An Integral perspective on  Sustainable Development and Climate Change Response</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In this thesis, I explore the implications of integral theory for sustainable development and climate change response. Integral theory seeks to integrate objective and subjective perspectives using a developmental orientation. It addresses issues of subjectivity that have received inadequate attention in mainstream approaches to sustainable development, while also providing theoretical grounding for the developmental aspect of sustainable development. According to integral theory, there are four main epistemological approaches to any problem: behavioural, systemic, psychological and cultural. The first is objective and individual, the second objective and collective, the third subjective and individual and the fourth subjective and collective. Development occurs within each of these realms. To test the value and implications of integral theory for sustainable development, I adopt a case study on climate change response in Australia. I begin the case study by using the four perspectives of integral theory to guide a review of the energy and climate change literature. I follow the literature review with a critical review of Australian energy and greenhouse policy, providing the starting point for development of an integral climate change response. While there is attention to subjectivity in the literature, it is not reflected in Australian policy practices. An objective perspective and an instrumental form of rationality dominate policy. In the literature review, I identify two gaps in the literature that deserve attention. The first is the role of public subsidies in creating the observed cost differential between renewable energy sources and fossil fuel energy. I examine the relative magnitude of subsidies to fossil fuels and renewable energy in the Australian energy and transport sectors and conclude that the distribution of these subsidies distorts the market in favour of fossil fuels, particularly in the transport sector. The second is the application of a developmental perspective to cultural theories of climate policy discourse. I introduce a method called meta-discourse analysis to identify consistencies and relationships across discourse descriptions by different authors and demonstrate that aspects of each discourse can be related developmentally.  Drawing on the literature review, policy review and other work, I propose an integral policy response to climate change that could be applied in Australia. The policy response combines participatory integrated assessment, normative futures work, a modified version of the cooperative discourse model for public participation, an evolutionary policy orientation and several methods to promote subjective development. The proposed policy approach should be equally applicable to other sustainable development issues.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Climate Response Change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/250</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Aristotelian Construction of the Social Economy of Land</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Aristotle's metaphor for economic relations was the household. Although the household is engaged in the material activities of internal production, consumption and exchange which are economic, its fundamental connections are social. Social dynamics, including care, respect, authority, loyalty, charity and self-restraint are the motivations within the household. These are all virtues in Aristotelian terms and can be grouped under the more general social virtue of solidarity which is the intention to act in support and draw closer to the other in relationship in such a way as to become more perfectly human. An economics based on this family metaphor will be socially grounded, it is social economics. A key identifier of social economics is its capacity to realise the common good. This thesis is an examination of the contribution of property in land to the common good leading to the identification of the location of land within social economics.  An Aristotelian methodology has been adopted for this thesis, following an examination of its component parts and comparison with alternative methodologies. While the defense of the methodology is not exhaustive, it is sufficient to provide reasonable justification of Aristotelian realism and point out some of the shortcomings of competing approaches. Aristotelian realism is accepted as employing an acceptance of essences, the validity of abstraction, and the importance of observation. Contrasted to positivism, Aristotelian realism accepts knowledge that is not simply observation-based, especially the possibility of the knowledge of essences.   Property theory has been reviewed. This includes ancient positions on property as well as modern. Islamic property theory has been included in the review in order to broaden the cultural base. Ancient  Western property theories have been been shown to be divided between simple acceptance of the fact of private ownership, especially evident in Roman law and early modern practice, and a more complex theory of ownership first articulated by Aristotle. Aristotle's theory of ownership was a dual principle of private ownership but common use. The Aristotelian position was developed by St. Thomas Aquinas in the Medieval period. St. Thomas recognised that property in external property was naturally for common use but privately owned by convention. John Locke attempted a labour based theory of absolute private property and Adam Smith returned to the positive fact of possession. The Islamic position straddled the Lockean and Thomistic. Modern property theory is a development of the Smithian identification property as a fact of society.  Apart from the institution of individual private property in land, several other economic institutions mark modern Western economics. The most important of these is the free market. The theoretical foundations of the free market have been examined and have been found to be based on moral foundations. The components of market theory have been reviewed and significant shortcomings have been revealed. The theory of supply has been found to contradict practice and the commonly portrayed market functions that are asserted to depict market behaviour in efficient circumstances have been shown be in error. Capitalisation has also been reviewed and its dependence on the risk-free real rate of return on money loans has been explored. The moral problem of usury has been introduced and linked to capitalisation, but not taken beyond recognition and defense of the fact that it is a social artifact rather than a product of economic forces.  The critical factor in the operation of the market was shown to be its inclusion of demand in the development of prices. In the absence of theoretical support, the acceptability of the market was tested empirically by surveying attitudes to demand based pricing. Three hundred and forty Sydney home-owners were asked ten questions regarding situations where prices and profits were linked to demand or price. The data was analysed and found to lend support to the hypothesis that demand-based pricing did not have community support. A general theory of property was constructed from human nature and the nature of land. It was then used to develop an ethical structure for the pricing of wages, land and products. It was argued that property rights in labour were fundamentally different to property rights in land, the former being natural and the latter being conventional. It was also evident that the market was an inappropriate instrument for the determination of wages, but appropriate for the determination of commodity prices. Land was recognised to be the gap between wage price and commodity price.  Ricardo's rent theory was reviewed as a mechanism for pricing land income. Various aspects and implications were considered and it was recognised that in a closed land market the returns to land competed with the return to labour in a manner that was better explained in political terms than economic. Despite its importance in social economy, the operation of Ricardian rent theory is obscured other mediating factors. It has also been used as the central theory in a protracted political debate over the taxation of land. Both of these issues have contributed to the the marginalisation of interest in rent theory and a degree of suspicion as to its validity.  A behavioural experiment was run to examine the validity of Ricardian rent theory within the confines of its own assumptions, which are basically those of an efficient market and the recognition that land has varying productivity. The results of the experiment lent strong support to the theory but highlighted the conventional nature of the return to labour. One of the shortcomings of Ricardian rent theory is its assertions regarding subsistence wages, and there was evidence in the experiment that did not support this aspect of the theory. The significance and construction of subsistence wages were specifically reviewed and also other sources of economic rents. An analysis of non-land economic rents revealed that they were either land-like, transient or politically maintained. A theory of supply was developed from a rent base that was argued to be causally accurate and returned a monotonic upward curve consistent with practical observation.  The implications of the political economy of the findings were reviewed. Some major traditions in economics interpreted in terms of the ethical issues revealed. The thesis concluded that many cultural resolutions of the property problem are possible, however they must conform to ethical fundamentals that may be paraphrased in the notion of solidarity. Suggestions for possible corrections or improvements to specific existing practices and policies were developed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Land Use</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/251</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History of the Sydney Film Festival 1954-1983</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study is intended to provide a record of the founding and development of one of Australia's oldest and longest surviving film festivals and to determine the nature and impact of the Festival in its engagement with other cultural, social, and political institutions over the thirty years from 1954 to 1983. I have taken my research from a variety of sources, primarily the archive of Sydney Film Festival papers and ephemera lodged at Mitchell Library, Sydney. I have utilized a number of publications from the period, including daily newspapers, trade papers and specialist film and art journals. These give some indication of the Festival's influence and impact within the wider community and help position it in terms of predominant cultural and social values. I conclude that the Sydney Film Festival has played a significant, and so far somewhat underestimated, role in the development of Australian film culture and industry, and has influenced the nature and reception of films in commercial distribution within the country. In a pedagogical sense, it has influenced contemporary understanding of film and film history, in part by privileging particular movements and filmmakers over others and in part by creating a communal and interactive environment in which films, filmmaking and other aspects of film culture can be discussed, analysed and celebrated. This is a history of an organisation whose membership included some of the major figures in Australian film and related media and I have been committed to bringing a human element to the events and issues explored. To this end, I have utilized the extensive Oral History archive created in 1992 by the Sydney Film Festival in order to commemorate its fortieth anniversary. As is often the case with historical research, some of these personal memories are in conflict with one another and with the documentary record. By a process of referencing and cross referencing, I hope I have arrived at an approximation of a truth about a moment in the life of an Australian cultural icon.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sydney Film Festival</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/252</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Policies and Discourses of Vocational Education and Training : and their impact on the formation of teachers' identities.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Education and training, in Australia, has experienced unprecedented levels of change in recent times. Government educational policies are now dominated by economic discourses that point to the need for all educational systems to contribute to economic development, by increasing the knowledge and skill levels of the present and future workforce. The twin discourses of new vocationalism and economic rationalism have now transformed Australian educational systems. But the effects of this transformation on the identities of teachers working in this changed environment have not been adequately examined. This study examines the impact of government policies on teachers' identities by investigating a particular group of teachers working in Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in Australia. The study has chosen teacher identity as its focus, because much of recent research has involved investigating the new knowledge and skills required of teachers working in this changed environment. However, this can be seen as making an overly instrumental means-ends connection between teachers' knowledge and skills and the professional practice of teaching. It fails to appreciate that when teachers are asked to 'do things differently' in their everyday teaching practices they are also being called on to become different teachers. That is, to have different understandings of their role in education, to have different relationships with students, to conceptualise their professional and vocational knowledge differently. In short, to change their identity. In order to investigate the impact of the policies and discourses of VET on TAFE teachers' identities the study locates itself, in part, within the interpretivist tradition of social research and uses the methods and methodologies of critical policy analysis, phenomenology and ethnography to investigate the research questions. It then uses a number of diverse theoretical perspectives to challenge and interrogate the interpretation made of the data gathered. The study undertakes a critical analysis of contemporary VET policies utilising a 'policy -as-discourse' approach to the analysis and draws on the methods of phenomenology and ethnography in order to generate situated discourses that are often overlooked in critical policy analysis. The study also uses the perspective offered by poststructuralism, which foregrounds the power of discourse in the formation of both the social world and individual identity. The conclusions reached suggest that TAFE teacher identity is an ambiguous discursive achievement constructed out of the multiple, historical organisational and individual discourses that all circulate in teachers' life worlds. These discourses now interact in complex and contradictory ways with the contemporary policies and discourses of vocational education and training resulting in teachers experiencing a degree of doubt and uncertainty concerning their identification with the new institution of TAFE.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Teachers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/253</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School-Museum Integrated Learning Experiences in Science: A learning journey</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The focus of this dissertation is my investigation into how primary school teachers can be guided to provide effective conditions for student learning on teacher-led school excursions to museums.  The dissertation follows my learning journey, beginning with my entering experiences as a teacher, museum educator and teacher educator and then following stages of literature search, questions, action and reflection.  The research design has affinity with action research and utilises an assemblage of methodologies which are empathetic with the study itself, principally observations and interviews.  My thesis is that a framework based on strategies which reflect informal learning behaviours of family groups, learner-centred teaching approaches, and meaningful integration of school and museum studies, can create favourable conditions for student learning on excursions.  Further, with minimal professional development, classroom teachers can implement such a framework.  The first of three field studies tested my understandings about current practices on teacher-led school excursions to museums.  Observations of 12 school excursions in Sydney, Australia, revealed a strong teacher orientation toward task completion rather than learning, and underlined the need to search for an alternative approach.  Following a literature search on school visits to museums, social constructivist learning and teaching, and family visits, a School-Museum Learning Framework (SMLF) was designed. The SMLF was trialed in the second field study in which I was the principal teacher as well as researcher, working with a Year 5/6 class.  The most significant finding was the students' recognition and declaration of their own learning in an environment in which they had choice and ownership of their learning.  Consideration of the nature and measurement of learning in informal settings led to a tentative tool for indicating engagement in learning processes. In my third field study I investigated the broader application of the SMLF in four trials involving seven teachers.  The teachers participated in a one-day professional development seminar and then conducted their own school-museum programs.  The results showed the SMLF to be robust under a range of circumstances.

The papers in this portfolio describe and analyse challenges faced by New Zealand midwives in achieving their full potential as autonomous health professionals and the strategies they developed to survive within a healthcare environment that despite changes, remained medicalised. Throughout this portfolio, a theoretical framework based on complexity theory provides a lens for critique of the varying challenges to midwifery development and strategies to progress the profession. The seven papers that make up this portfolio were developed and written over a five-year period from 1999 to 2003. During this time I was involved in various activities supporting midwifery in New Zealand, including the establishment of a postgraduate midwifery programme and participation in the refocusing of both the New Zealand College of Midwives and the Midwifery and Maternity Provider Organisation. These activities took me to various parts of the country, enabling me to maintain contact with midwives from a variety of settings. The first paper sets the scene for the portfolio by exploring the socio-political context of contemporary midwifery in New Zealand. The second paper tracks the emergence of a theoretical framework out of Complexity theory and presents a set of principles, which guide the critique of midwifery services and professional development, explored in the subsequent papers. Part Three documents the development of a contextual scanning tool, used to analyse the organisation of maternity care by midwives in rural settings. Part Four presents the findings of the scan and strategies for consolidating the role of midwives as key providers of maternity services in rural localities. Part Five documents the development of a programme for optimising midwifery leadership within the health sector, while Part Six explores the risks and opportunities for midwives with the development of clinical governance strategies by District Health Boards. Part seven focuses on strategies to increase the potential for midwives to consolidate, maintain and further develop community-based maternity services throughout the country. This portfolio provides an organisational analysis of contemporary maternity services in New Zealand and presents a multifaceted approach to securing midwifery as a key health profession and midwives as the main provider of maternity services to women in this country. The findings of this collection of works, identified midwifery in New Zealand as precariously positioned within a rapidly changing health service environment. While appearing most vulnerable, midwifery within the rural and primary settings appeared to offer the most potential for innovative development in order to secure the place of midwives as the prime providers of health care for women in childbirth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">20th Century</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/256</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LEDs and Doped Polymer Light Guides for Efficient Illumination and Colour Engineering</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This project involves the study of optical properties of polymers doped with TRIMM (transparent refractive index matched micro-particles), and their uses in light guides. The refractive index difference between dopant and host material is small (0.02), so forward transmittance is high, and losses due to backscattering are negligible. Flexible polymer optical fibre (POF) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) rods are being incorporated into an increasing range of lighting and light mixing applications. For energy efficient mixing of red, green and blue (RGB) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to produce white light and a range of other colours, light is transmitted from the end of a light guide ('endlight').  A major problem here is solved, namely the achievement of uniform illumination, simultaneously with low losses from scattering. Light output from RGB LEDs is shown to be completely mixed by short TRIMM-doped light guides. Alternatively, long lengths of TRIMM-doped POF can be used for 'side-light'. The concentration of TRIMM for these is chosen such that light is emitted from the side walls of the guide to give even illumination along its length.  A geometrical method of ray tracing in particle-doped rectangular and cylindrical light guides is derived, and Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations performed for undoped and TRIMM-doped light guides. The evolution of the distribution of ray angles, internal and external to a light guide, with propagation distance are studied. Computer simulations of angular distribution of light emitted from the wall of POF agree with measurements performed using a photogoniometer.  Simulations and measurements of light output intensity and colour from RGB LED arrays when projected from the end of a mixing rod, are also presented. Colour calculations agree with photometric measurements of RGB LED output from clear and TRIMM-doped PMMA mixing rods. Results of transmittance measurements and computer simulations show that light losses are almost entirely due to Fresnel reflectance from the entrance and exit surfaces of the rods. Photogoniometer measurements of the angular distribution of light from LEDs are used as a basis for LED source models used in ray tracing simulations. Results of an investigation comparing the effect of using a smoothed LED source model instead of measurement-based models on simulated light output distributions are presented. The light output from LEDs can have sudden peaks in intensity at certain angles, resulting in distinctive patterns with clear colour separation, after mixing in clear polymer mixing rods. These caustic patterns are eliminated by using TRIMM-doped mixing rods, with a transmittance of 90% after Fresnel losses, which can be readily reduced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Properties</field><field name="subject">Light Emitting Diodes</field><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/257</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disabling Journeys: the social relations of tourism for people with impairments in Australia - an analysis of government tourism authorities and accommodation sector practice and discourses</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores the citizenship rights of people with disabilities and their experience in relation to one activity and industry - tourism. It is proposed that people with disabilities living in Australia have been excluded, oppressed and disadvantaged by government, tourism authorities (TA) and tourism industry (TI), practice and discourses. This exclusion, oppression and disadvantage has been perpetrated by the government, tourism authorities and tourism industry, whose practices and discourses do not provide an equality of service provision for the group. From this position the central question addressed is:  To what extent are the tourism patterns and experiences of people with impairments in Australia unduly constrained by tourism authorities and tourism industry practice and discourse?  In taking direction from the social model of disability (Oliver 1990), the proposition deliberately uses the word impairments rather than disabilities as both a definitional and conceptual approach to the research. This is because the question tests whether the social relations produce the constraints that people with impairments face in negotiating tourism experiences and, hence, create disabling journeys. In other words, the disabling social relations transform the impaired person to the person with a disability in the tourism context. 'Unduly' means that people with disabilities were not provided with an equality of service provision in comparison to the non-disabled.  The research design and methodology involves inductive inquiry utilising both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. This includes a multiple methodological approach involving secondary data analysis of major national and regional surveys, content/discourse analysis, in-depth interviews and a focus group. The secondary data sources involved the Disability, Ageing and Carers Survey (ABS 1993; 1998 n=42,000), National Visitors Survey (BTR 1998 n=78,000) and Anxiety to Access (Tourism NSW 1998 n=2647). A content analysis is undertaken of the HREOC (2002) complaint cases, public hearings, public inquiries, disability action plans and disability Standards projects relevant to tourism. A content analysis is also undertaken of tourism authorities' disability tourism initiatives from 1990-2000. In depth interviews are undertaken with three separate populations that include people with disabilities (n=15), accommodation managers (n=10) and responsible officers from tourism authorities (n=3). A focus group of accommodation managers (n=23) is also undertaken. The data are analysed and interpreted using binary logistic regression, ordinal logistic regression, phenomenology, grounded theory and discourse analysis.  The central argument to emerge from this thesis is that disability is a social relationship - or rather a complex set of social relationships - between people with disabilities, and the organisations that control and administer the institutional and social environments in which they live. Tourism represents an important arena for social and cultural participation. Given the commitment by governments to 'reduce disability' it is thus critical to consider whether the relationships in the area of tourism are disabling or enabling. The thesis shows that the practices and discourses of tourism authorities and the tourism industry unduly constrain the tourism opportunities and experiences of people with impairments in Australia and create disabling journeys.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">Government policy.</field><field name="subject">People with disabilities.</field><field name="subject">Discrimination.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/260</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of imagination in autobiography and transformative learning</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">By telling and retelling their life stories in everyday social interaction, adult learners describe times of continuity and change in their lives, and give an account of their self-formation. A disjuncture between the learners' life stories and events experienced either in their social context or in their inner life invites their reflection on its significance. Transformative learning occurs when reflection on such experience leads to interpretations which change the learners' meaning perspectives and their social practice. These changes are incorporated into a new version of the life story. Adult education approaches to perspective transformation have generally emphasised the interpretive role of critical reflection and thinking. Autobiography, as a metaphor for transformative learning, proposes that transformative learning also has the quality of a narrative constructed with imagination. Through ongoing interpretation of events in their inner and outer experience, learners compose their lives and their life stories. The social context is a dynamic setting for autobiographical learning. Its structures and institutions concretise the learners' social and cultural tradition, which has been shaped by design and historical circumstance. Through the prejudgments of their tradition, learners perceive reality and construct corresponding lives and life stories. Theoretical approaches to interpreting life experience differ in their estimation of the value of the learners' tradition. In adult education theory and practice, Habermas' critical theory has been enlisted as a conceptual basis for perspective transformation. Little attention has been afforded to either Gadamer's hermeneutic consciousness, or Ricoeur's critical hermeneutics as ways to understand the interpretive activity which leads to the learners' self-formation and the re-invention of their life story. Six former Roman Catholic priests participated in a cooperative inquiry, telling their life stories of remarkable change in life choice. They sought deeper self-knowledge, as well as an understanding of the widespread social phenomenon of Catholic priests choosing to marry. Their autobiographical accounts indicate that, as they gradually composed new life narratives, these learners gained personal authority as the authors of their lives. The stories also indicate that, at one time or other, a state of stagnation developed in the authors' lives. Despite the learners' lengthy periods of consciously attempting to resolve the stalemate, it was an act of spontaneous imagination which illuminated a way through. The explanatory understanding of autobiographical or transformative learning proposed here claims that imagination, which bridges the domains of conscious and unconscious knowing in the author, is a partner with critical reflection in interpreting the life in its social context. Through transformative or hermeneutic conversation, adult educators may foster and promote the formation of autobiography and transformative learning. Further research, linking autobiography and transformative learning, would purposefully explore the role of other internal processes in transformative learning, such as feeling, and examine their relationship with imagination. It is likely that the acknowledgment of imagination as integral to transformative learning would lead to research which considers models of personhood other than those which emphasise ego as the conscious director of knowing and learning.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">Imagination</field><field name="subject">Adult learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/261</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Educational Aspects with New Technology: Teaching Basic Statistics Using Hypermedia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The increasing popularity and rapid development of the Internet and specifically the World-Wide Web in recent years has led to an exponential growth of users around the world in many different application areas. Following this growing trend, many eager educators have also embraced this new technology and have begun to use it as a tool in delivering education. A plethora of applications has already been developed in an attempt to implement educational content in this way. A general concern for many researchers is that most of these applications are not efficient in delivering educational outcomes and fail to achieve their educational goal. In the present project we propose that the present failure to deliver educational outcomes in an efficient way has its origins in the lack of concern and focus of developers on modern learning theory. Therefore, in this work we establish the foundations in terms of an interdisciplinary contribution from areas such as, educational learning theory, human-computer interaction and web design guidelines for the design and implementation of web pages aimed at facilitating the teaching and tutoring of basic statistics concepts. As a result of this work, a specific set of learning theories were researched and analyzed, the basic ideas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) were explored and a set of appropriate principles from HCI were chosen. Furthermore, a selected group of Web design guidelines were researched, studied and selected to ensure that the final product contributes to the efficient delivery of subject content and effective achievement of learning outcomes. In addition, a number of parallels were formulated and discussed between the different areas of research. The establishment of a series of combined principles will not only contribute to the aims of the present project but also to further projects initiated by the Department of Econometrics at The University Sydney.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Interactive multimedia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/262</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Aspects Of The Continuously Varying Schedule Process For Timber Drying</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Drying of timber increases its durability and strength. Therefore, timber should be dried to a moisture content close to the equilibrium moisture content it will attain in service. The drying of timber from its natural green state to the required moisture content is thus an important part of the production cycle. Hardwood species, due to their macroscopic structures, are more difficult to dry as compared to softwood.  A great deal of research has centred in recent years on developing a fast drying process for softwood; on the other hand, there is a need for a process to dry hardwood rapidly. A new drying technique, called Continuously Varying Schedule (CVS) was recently developed by the author for the purpose of rapidly drying the medium to high density hardwood.  The investigation described herein was carried out to compare the CVS process with the conventional drying process. The factors compared were drying time, quality of timber produced and the energy consumed.  It was found that the CVS process reduced the drying time by 34.5% and saved 30.7% of the energy. It produced also, a competitive dried timber quality. The process achieved highly efficient drying, as the rate of drying (MC%/h x 100) was 80.3% higher than the conventional process and also, the amount of water evaporated per unit of drying time (g/h) was 67.1% higher. The CVS drying performance has achieved a 71.9% increase in the amount of moisture content reduced per unit of energy (MC%/kWh x 100) and a 57.8% increase in the amount of water evaporated per unit of energy (g/kWh) as compared to the conventional process.  Much emphasis was placed on energy saving in the drying plant and it was suggested that a heat exchanger be used to recover waste energy from the exhausted air of the kiln. A dehumidifier coupled to a solar-powered system, backed up with an electric or wood waste booster, was recommended as a low-cost energy drying plant. An alternative source to the petroleum-based energy was also discussed.  The study of air flow through the timber stack in the kiln was a major part of this investigation as it is one of the principal features of the CVS process. A new technique was developed to measure the air velocity and the turbulence level %. The technique involves the integration of a hot wire anemometer, data logger, computer and computer peripherals. The air velocity profiles for twelve fan speeds, between 400 and 2200 rpm, were drawn by a computer graphical program, using data collected by the above circuit. It was obvious that the boundary layer which exists around the timber surface at the low air velocity protects the timber being processed against the high and continuously increasing temperature during the CVS drying process.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Timber</field><field name="subject">Lumber</field><field name="subject">Drying</field><field name="subject">Forest Products Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/263</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epiphanies: An Existential Philosophical and Psychological Enquiry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate the relatively under-researched and under- developed nature of positive change and transformation that is sudden and abrupt, as defined by the term epiphany. A review of the literature across the disciplines of sociology, literary studies, education and psychology pertaining to epiphanies revealed a modest and disparate body of knowledge. As yet only two studies to date have developed and tested a conceptual framework describing and explaining epiphanies, both situated in the theoretical perspectives of developmental, clinical, cognitive and behavioural psychology. Due to the sparseness of the epiphanic literature, a thorough review was undertaken, producing a set of six core characteristics, which were tested and interpreted from a self-identity existential perspective. Existential philosophy and psychology provide an understanding of human experiences based on personal meaning and the essential realities of the human condition. In order to encapsulate an existential theory of knowledge, a narrative approach to methodology was employed to collect, analyse and interpret participants' epiphanies, from which three main conclusions were drawn. Firstly, an epiphany is a profound illumination of the inauthentic and authentic modes of self-identity, which provide the impetus for a more honest and courageous encounter with the conditions of existence. Secondly, the participants' life-stories illustrate that an epiphany is a valid experience as indicated by support for the set of six core characteristics developed from the literature. Lastly, an epiphany is an intentional experience made significant and enduring by the ascription of personal meaning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epiphanies</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">existential</field><field name="subject">philosophical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/264</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhetoric and Reality: Narrowing the Gap in Australian Midwifery</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study draws on multiple modes of expression in texts that have been generated by my experience of midwifery development since I moved from England to Australia in early 1997. The Professional Doctorate in Midwifery at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) has enabled me to produce and study my work as a midwifery practitioner, researcher, educator, writer and activist and to engage in a process of scholarship that both informs and is generated by practice. This has allowed me to analyse the complex issues that I, and other midwives in Australia, face as we strategise to narrow the gap between our ideals and the realities of the professional and political constraints that challenge midwifery. The study analyses the rhetorical communications I have employed as both carriers of 'vision' and 'means of persuasion' and the deliberate strategies to make changes that I believe will benefit childbearing women.   My portfolio challenges me and others, to explore how we are able to identify, enact, and convince others of the emancipatory potential of midwifery.  Rhetorical innovations are therefore linked to the exposition of woman centred midwifery care; an overall goal being to enable situations in which women can experience the potential power that transforms lives, through their experiences of childbirth. In the process, I aim to produce new knowledge that will equip midwives to understand practice, policy and political situations and see new possibilities for responding and taking action.  I have analysed and explained my work using a framework appropriated from rhetorical theory and drawing on a range of feminist perspectives. This involves identifying and critiquing the rhetorical innovations that I have used when trying to create possibilities and persuade others of the value of midwifery and the need to make changes happen in practice, education and regulation.  My study analyses the rhetorical nature of my own work as presented in my portfolio in a range of carefully selected texts that I have authored during my candidature. These include journal and newsletter articles, conference papers, research activities, policy submissions, education and training materials, the development of midwifery standards, formal and informal communications, and other documents, all aimed in one way or another at the rhetorical strategy of stimulating interest and action. The portfolio texts that arise from this work form the empirical data that is studied. However, in varying ways these texts elicit understandings about the rhetoric and reality of Australian midwifery and the deliberate strategies that are employed by midwives to make changes that will benefit childbearing women. They therefore stand in their own right as contributions to the thesis with their own discursive and epistemological intent. The reflexive process employed in this thesis highlights comparisons between what is being positioned as the potential of midwifery with what is also presented as the reality played out in contemporary Australian maternity service provision and in midwifery education and regulation. The thesis weaves its way around the portfolio documents, attempting to bring to life and discuss the culture in which rhetorical innovations and intentional strategies are aimed at narrowing the gap between 'rhetoric and reality'.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/265</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Village Midwives and Cadres in Improving the Nutritional Status of Pregnant Women in Selected Rural Villages in Two Districts, Banten Province Indonesia 2003: A Longitudinal Descriptive Study</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study is a longitudinal descriptive study conducted in eight villages of Banten province, Indonesia. The research describes the nutritional status of two groups of pregnant village women and investigates the implementation and impact of an intervention to improve nutrition in pregnancy. The intervention aimed to improve the effectiveness of village midwives and cadres by improving the nutrition of pregnant women, particularly iron deficiency, through the use of a community development approach. The thesis identifies the importance of good nutrition during pregnancy and some of the factors, which influence it in the context of this study. It examines the health promotion programs for improving iron intake and nutrition in developing countries and specifically examines the programs that are used in Indonesia. A small decrease in the rate of anaemia appears to have occurred due to these programs, but the anaemia rate remains high. There has been little systematic examination of the cultural and social factors that may influence nutrition in pregnant women in Indonesia and few studies, which have measured the nutritional status of pregnant women. The goals of the study are to: *	Describe the social and cultural factors that influence nutrition, under nutrition and iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy and to measure the nutritional status of rural women in Banten Province, Indonesia.  *	Improve the knowledge and skills of village midwives and cadres in using community development and effective communication to improve iron supplementation and nutrition. The conceptual framework for the study was derived from principles of health promotion, in particular the 'Proceed and Proceed' model (Green &amp; Kreuter 1991).  The study took place in eight villages in Banten province, Indonesia. Four of the villages received a community development intervention and four villages were used for comparison.  The study was undertaken in three stages: Stage 1 - Baseline Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection; Stage 2 - Intervention; and Stage 3 - Follow Up Evaluation. The intervention was guided by the results of Stage 1 and consisted of a two-day workshop aimed to improve their knowledge, communication skills of the midwives and cadres and their ability to use a community development approach to improving nutrition in the villages. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the research at Stage 1 and Stage 3. Ethnographic methods of interview, observation, field notes and survey were used to collect information about the cultural and social factors that influence nutrition and nutritional practices during pregnancy. The knowledge and practices of midwives and cadres were also explored. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.  Forty pregnant women (20 from the intervention villages and 20 from the comparison villages) participated in the qualitative component of the research before the intervention (Stage 1). The follow up evaluation occurred 12 months later, and a different group of 35 pregnant women (20 from the intervention villages and 15 from the comparison villages) participated in the qualitative component of the research at Stage 3. The same eight midwives and 16 cadres participated in the qualitative research at Stage 1 and Stage 3. Quantitative data collected at Stage 1 and Stage 3 included socio demographic data, obstetric information and nutritional data (haemoglobin level, body mass index, and the weight gain of pregnant women).  Data was collected from 210 women before the intervention and 189 women after the intervention. Some changes in the practices of midwives and cadres were apparent after the intervention with midwives building better rapport, communicating more effectively and providing more information and support to pregnant women. Cadres also talked more about nutrition in community meetings. Changes in the behaviour and approach of village midwives and cadres' in relation to nutrition education resulted in improved nutritional behaviour of pregnant women to some extent, but poverty and culture restricted the ability of pregnant women to access better food. The intervention did not effect the overall nutritional status of the pregnant women. Because of time and logistical constraints, the intervention was not able to influence the community's health in the medium term in the intervention villages. The results of this study showed that the comparison villages sometimes had better results than the intervention villages.  A possible explanation is that the systematic evaluation of nutritional status may have increased the awareness and practice of the better-educated and more knowledgeable midwives who were located in the comparison villages. The comparison midwives had a better basic education in midwifery when compared to the intervention midwives. It appeared these better-educated workers responded positively to the research even without exposure to the intervention. The study showed that the position of the pregnant woman is low within the hierarchy of both the health care system and the power structures of the broader community. Husbands, mother-in-law, village midwives, cadres and village leaders all have more power to determine what pregnant women can and cannot eat and drink than women do themselves. However, some women tried to access better food after the intervention by subverting culture and the authority of husbands and mother-in-law and eating nutritious food in secret.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/266</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Measures in Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures has always been controversial, particularly, as they do not address the issue of the level of local value added in the production process.  Are these measures simply industry assistance measures under another guise, or are they to protect the 'fair trade' framework to further the opportunity for free trade?  All the indications are that these measures reflect the former option.  However, the global political climate as represented through the GATT and now the WTO Agreements is to tolerate the imposition of both anti-dumping and countervailing measures provided they are applied according to the provisions of the Agreements.  It is becoming increasingly more difficult for any nation state to abolish the right of their 'guest' industries to obtain anti-dumping or countervailing relief, given the economic power of multinational industries operating within their boundaries.  The practical issue is for each nation state to use these measures in a way which is of least detriment to their economy.  Gruen in 1986 reviewed the application of the then Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, and found that there needed to be a tightening-up of the injury test applied to anti-dumping cases.  It is recommended that Gruen's tougher injury standards be implemented forthwith.  He also recommended a continuing role for the Industry Commission as the appeal body for a review of the facts, and for there to be a continuing assessment of the effects of the measures imposed.  The government, however, created an Anti-Dumping Authority attached to the then Department of Industry Technology and Commerce (DITAC), whose member and officers came from that department.  The principal function of this body was to review the preliminary decisions of Customs, and to recommend the imposition of duties or acceptance of an undertaking to the Minister.  There was no provision for an independent review of facts.  One of the results of the increased complexity of the existing process and consequently the law, is a large increase in litigation before the Federal Court.  There is a need to simplify the administrative structure and the provisions of the domestic law.  The latter should be accomplished by the incorporation of the provisions of the WTO Agreements directly into domestic law.  The espoused policy objectives of the government have not been met.  The application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures favour import competing industries, and are against countries from which imports are growing.  Korea and China have been singled out, with these countries showing the highest incidence of import weighted of anti-dumping measures.  They also happen to be countries with which Australia has a trade surplus, a policy factor which is neglected by the administering authorities.  There is a need to redress this imbalance.  Predation identified by the government as a reason for taking anti-dumping action, has been shown not to be a reason for the application of anti-dumping duties in Australia.  As a small country, Australia should take advantage of the use of the WTO dispute settlement process in settling anti-dumping and countervailing disputes.  Consultations should commence at the earliest possible stage in inquiries, with the view to the settlement of the dispute by trade negotiation so that the outcome can be beneficial to both parties.  This may, for example, allow for the specialisation in production between the two Members.  WTO dispute settlement is seen as a positive approach to dispute settlement, whereas the use of the domestic courts tends to elevate the dispute between the parties.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to take a leadership role in settling all anti-dumping and countervailing actions through the WTO dispute settlement process, with a view to a positive outcome for both Members.  Placing an anti-dumping import tax on intermediate products entering Australia is counter-productive, as it increases the cost of inputs to downstream users.  Temporary relief should be given by way of production subsidy, if the matter cannot be resolved through WTO trade consultations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dumping (International trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia.

The interest in Knowledge Management is understandable given the moves towards knowledge based economies and workplaces.  Large organisations have begun to understand the value of the knowledge held within their organisation. Nowadays, the value of an organisation may be based on its intellectual capital and this is demonstrated by organisations being sold for many times its worth in terms of hard assets. The concept of being able to store and use the 'knowledge' that is generated inside an organisation has obvious appeal. However, the management of this 'knowledge' and the ability to use it for an advantage requires careful planning and an understanding of knowledge inside the organisation and its workers. This process requires a mix of organisational, cultural and technology understanding.  Current research and vendor interest is focussing on large organisations. However, Small to Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) also have an explicit need to manage their intellectual capital. Research interest in large organisations is strong, but SMEs cannot always use the findings that are targeted to large organisations and will probably be unable to afford the specific Knowledge Management tools offered by vendors.  Nevertheless, SMEs can use the knowledge in their organisations to gain an advantage.

In general, this involves fusion of a toxin gene with sequence encoding a variety of clinically relevant proteins or peptides. Using these techniques a recombinant immunotoxin has been engineered by fusing the genes encoding an antibody fragment with the sequence of a small cytolytic peptide, melittin. The antibody fragment consists of the antigen binding site derived from a murine monoclonal antibody K- 1-21, which binds to human free kappa light chains and recognises a specific epitope (KMA) expressed on the surface of human myeloma and lymphoma cells. The toxic portion of the molecule is melittin, a 26 amino acid, membrane lytic peptide which is a major component of bee venom. Using PCR a single chain Fv (scFv) was constructed by linking VH and VL genes with an oligonucleotide encoding a flexible, hydrophilic peptide. The melittin gene was synthesised as an oligonucleotide and extended by PCR. Nucleotide sequence encoding a linker peptide was added to the 5' end and a primer encoding a FLAG peptide was used to extend the 3' end. This gene construct was then ligated into the recombinant expression vector, pPOW scFv, to create the fusion gene encoding the recombinant immunotoxin. The gene construct was expressed in the periplasm of E.coli (TOPP2) using the secretion signal pelB . Expression of the foreign protein was monitored by western blot using a monoclonal antibody which recognises the FLAG peptide encoded at the carboxy terminal region of the gene construct. Expression of the recombinant immunotoxin was optimised and the resulting protein was purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography. Antigen binding activity was assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry using a human myeloma cell line, HMy2, which expresses the KMA antigen.Binding of the immunotoxin to a control human cell line, K562, which does not express KMA on the cell surface was also assessed. The results indicated that the recombinant immunotoxin retained antigen binding specificity and it was cytotoxic towards the target cell line (HMy2).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antibody-toxin conjugates</field><field name="subject">antibody-toxin conjugates -- theraputic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/270</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Discovery and Fair Intelligent Admission Control over Scalable Internet</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Internet currently supports a best-effort connectivity service. There has been an increasing demand for the Internet to support Quality of Service (QoS) to satisfy stringent service requirements from many emerging networking applications and yet to utilize the network resources efficiently. However, it has been found that even with augmented QoS architecture, the Internet cannot achieve the desired QoS and furthermore, there are concerns about the scalability of any available QoS solutions. If the network is not provisioned adequately, the Internet is not capable to handle congestion condition. This is because the Internet is unaware of its internal network QoS states therefore it is not possible to provide QoS when the network state changes dynamically.  This thesis addresses the following question: Is it possible to deliver the applications with QoS in the Internet fairly and efficiently while keeping scalability?  In this dissertation we answer this question affirmatively by proposing an innovative service architecture: the Resource Discovery (RD) and Fair Intelligent Admission Control (FIAC) over scalable Internet. The main contributions of this dissertation are as follows: 1. To detect the network QoS state, we propose the Resource Discovery (RD) framework to provide network QoS state dynamically. The Resource Discovery (RD) adopts feedback loop mechanism to collect the network QoS state and reports to the Fair Intelligent Admission Control module, so that FIAC is capable to take resource control efficiently and fairly. 2. To facilitate network resource management and flow admission control, two scalable Fair Intelligent Admission Control architectures are designed and analyzed on two levels: per-class level and per-flow level. Per-class FIAC handles the aggregate admission control for certain pre-defined aggregate. Per-flow FIAC handles the flow admission control in terms of fairness within the class. 3. To further improve its scalability, the Edge-Aware Resource Discovery and Fair Intelligent Admission Control is proposed which does not need the core routers involvement.  We devise and analyze implementation of the proposed solutions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. For the Resource Discovery, two closed-loop feedback solutions are designed and investigated. The first one is a core-aware solution which is based on the direct QoS state information. To further improve its scalability, the edge-aware solution is designed where only the edges (not core)are involved in the feedback QoS state estimation. For admission control, FIAC module bridges the gap between 'external' traffic requirements and the 'internal' network ability. By utilizing the QoS state information from RD, FIAC intelligently allocate resources via per-class admission control and per-flow fairness control.  We study the performance and robustness of RD-FIAC through extensive simulations. Our results show that RD can obtain the internal network QoS state and FIAC can adjust resource allocation efficiently and fairly.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Scalability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/271</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence, judicial notice and party comment: principles for ascertaining facts which predicate constitutional validity</field><field name="creator">Rochow, Neville Grant.</field><field name="description">Typescript (photocopy) Bibliography: leaves vii-xiv.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">NU</field><field name="subject">Procedure (Law) Australia</field><field name="subject">Evidence (Law) Australia</field><field name="subject">Justice, Administration of Australia</field><field name="subject">Trials</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09LM/09lmr781.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:5933187</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring, women and the construction of academic identities</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the influence of mentoring on the formation of the identities of women academics in Australian universities. Many Australian and New Zealand universities have introduced some form of mentoring initiative for women academics over the last decade. The aim of these initiatives is usually expressed in terms of supporting women's career development in order to increase the representation of women in senior positions in universities. I take up Foucault's theory of governmentality together with feminist theories of subjectivity, to examine the ways in which mentoring contributes to 'producing' the women as academic subjects of the times. My analysis of the formation of the subjectivities of the women concerned is set in the context of a political economy of contemporary higher education accompanied by the changing nature of academic work. I argue that mentoring has found support in recent years because it responds to the concerns of 'the enterprise university' with improving performance while also being seen to respond to the problem of gender inequality. The thesis is based on interviews conducted with 17 women academics who have participated in a formal mentoring program or who have been mentored informally by a colleague in their universities, six of which are discussed in detail. I use a feminist interpretive framework to analyse the discourses through which the women and I construct their accounts at interview. I also highlight the parallels between the confessional aspects of feminist research interviewing and the confessional space of the mentoring relationship itself, particularly mentoring of women by women. On the basis of this analysis, I argue that mentoring has a number of productive effects, producing particular sorts of self-regulating subjects, together with new knowledges and discourses of work and of the self. In their engagement in mentoring, the women take up a project of self-review and self-regulation. This can be understood as a biographical project of the self. It is a project that is iterative and ongoing, as the women navigate the discourses of academic work, career, gender, mothering, sexuality, social class and ethnicity, amongst others. This process is frequently fragmented and contested as the women confront the contradictions within the combined positioning of themselves and their positioning by others. Rather than try to resolve the tensions and contradictions that characterise this process, these tensions might be better explored in terms of their productive potential for disrupting the gendered work order of universities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">academia</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/273</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making meaning through History: scaffolding students' conceptual understanding through dialogue</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aims to articulate a theory of teaching that accounts for both the cognitive development of the learner and the social context in which learning occurs. It contributes to discussions about a socially constructed theory of pedagogy that can inform classroom practice. It explores firstly the role of the teacher in supporting students' conceptual understanding and secondly the importance of dialogue as a means of apprenticing students into the discourse of a subject discipline. The sociocultural notion of 'scaffolding' and the way in which various 'scaffolding' strategies support students' learning are examined through the classroom data. This thesis also explores the classroom as a site of activity in which educational practice is enacted. The significance of language as a 'tool' for learning is central to this study, as is the notion of learning as a social process. Language is a mediating tool that enables a dialogic engagement that supports the development of thinking that is consistent with the goals of the teacher. Also investigated is the use of various semiotic modalities, in addition to language, to support the active co-construction of knowledge. The research is conducted in a Year 7 History class (the first year of high school) in an independent, secondary boys' high school using a case study approach. It uses observation in naturalistic settings, interviews and written documentation. A significant outcome of this research has been the identification of discourse strategies and other semiotic systems such as visual, gestural and actional cues, and examination of the ways in which they function in the discourse to support student learning in the local and immediate context. The importance of all aspects that constitute the context in which the students are learning is also affirmed in this study. Context is not merely a 'backdrop' or background to language, it is integral to the creation of meaning and field knowledge. Another major conclusion that can be drawn from this research is the distinction between scaffolding at a macro level, consisting of a planned, 'designed-in' approach to a unit of work in a subject discipline and the lessons that constitute it, and contingent scaffolding that operates at a micro level or 'at the point of need'. By applying a variety of linguistic tools drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistic theory, it has been possible to articulate the kinds of discourse and multimodal strategies that constitute the nature of scaffolding. A further finding in this research is the value of using detailed analysis of the data with different analytical tools to identify emerging patterns in the discourse and also to 'view' the same data through different 'lenses'. An additional finding is the significance of an Induction genre that provides foundational understandings about the study of History for apprentice historians. This is supported by two post-foundational lessons that form a Macrogenre. This macrogenre reinforces the application of focus questions that are fundamental to historical study and an approach to answering these questions that is consistent with the methodology of the subject. Another finding relates to the role the teacher adopts in the classroom. The classroom in this research is strongly teacher guided in terms of the development of content and ways of controlling the development of discourse. This research shows that this does not preclude the classroom from being dialogic. Even though there is a knowledge and status differential between the teacher as expert and the student as novice, the teacher provides opportunities for discussion and development of ideas about the topic. Finally, this study confirms the value of drawing on a broad range of theories to inform the research. These multiple perspectives draw from sociocultural approaches to a socially oriented theory of learning; Activity Theory, and the notion of language as a social semiotic. This range of perspectives allows for 'rich' descriptions from which to draw conclusions about effective teaching and learning practices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication in teaching</field><field name="subject">Observation ( Educational method)</field><field name="subject">Educational Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/274</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms in the Study of Multiperfect and Odd Perfect Numbers</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">A long standing unanswered question in number theory concerns the existence (or not) of odd perfect numbers. Over time many properties of an odd perfect number have been established and refined. The initial goal of this research was to improve the lower bound on the number of distinct prime factors of an odd perfect number, if one exists, to at least 9. Previous approaches to this problem involved the analysis of a carefully chosen set of special cases with each then being eliminated by a contradiction. This thesis applies an algorithmic, factor chain approach to the problem. The implementation of such an approach as a computer program allows the speed, accuracy and flexibility of modern computer technology to not only assist but even direct the discovery process. In addition to considering odd perfect numbers, several related problems were investigated, concerned with (i) harmonic, (ii) even multiperfect and (iii) odd triperfect numbers. The aim in these cases was to demonstrate the correctness and versatility of the computer code and to fine tune its efficiency while seeking improved properties of these types of numbers. As a result of this work, significant improvements have been made to the understanding of harmonic numbers. The introduction of harmonic seeds, coupled with a straightforward procedure for generating most harmonic numbers below a chosen bound, expands the opportunities for further investigations of harmonic numbers and in particular allowed the determination of all harmonic numbers below 10 to the power 12 and a proof that there are no odd harmonic numbers below 10 to the power 15. When considering even multiperfect numbers, a search procedure was implemented to find the first 10-perfect number as well as several other new ones. As a fresh alternative to the factor chain search, a 0-1 linear programming model was constructed and used to show that all multiperfect numbers divisible by 2 to the power of a,  for a being less than or equal to 65, subject to a modest constraint, are known in the literature. Odd triperfect numbers (if they exist) have properties which are similar to, but simpler than, those for odd perfect numbers. An extended test on the possible prime factors of such a number was developed that, with minor differences, applies to both odd triperfect and odd perfect numbers. When applicable, this test allows an earlier determination of a contradiction within a factor chain and so reduces the effort required. It was also shown that an odd triperfect number must be greater than 10 to the power 128. While the goal of proving that an odd perfect number must have at least 9 distinct prime factors was not achieved, due to mainly practical limitations, the algorithmic approach was able to show that for an odd perfect number with 8 distinct prime factors, (i) if it is exactly divisible by 3 to the power of 2a then a = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or a is greater than or equal to 31 (ii) if the special component is pi to the power of alpha, pi less than 10 to the 6 and pi to the (alpha+1) less than 10 to the 40, then alpha = 1.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Perfect numbers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/275</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Battered Body : A Feminist Legal History</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis investigates a current debate within feminist theory, and specifically within feminist legal theory, about how to challenge the liberal construction of women's subjectivity. It contends that positioning women as either equal to or different from the universalised liberal subject (based on male experience) fails to recognise women's experience as diverse, and differentiated. This thesis explores this issue through the empirical area of the treatment in the public sphere (constituted by the state and the law) of domestic violence, and of domestic violence survivors who kill their abusive spouses. It argues that the current feminist jurisprudential responses to the battered woman who kills, articulated through criticisms of the Battered Woman Syndrome, identify the need to challenge the binary oppositional framework in which these cases are decided and discussed by liberal legalism. However, it suggests that these responses do not ground their discussion in the historical preconditions which gave rise to the debate and the feminist framework in which that debate is conducted. This thesis argues that an historical re-examination of the ways in which women's experience of domestic violence, as well as the law's reading of it, was constructed is an important contribution to feminist legal theory. It undertakes this historical re-examination by situating the Battered Woman Syndrome and domestic violence within the struggles and campaigns of feminism in the past, especially feminism as it developed through the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970s. It argues that the understanding of women and women's experience as diversely constituted through this period is essential for an understanding of current debates. This thesis represents an interdisciplinary feminist legal history. It uses both the method and evidence of history to challenge the legal understandings of battered women who kill. It posits that an interdisciplinary engagement between postmodern legal and historical theories, which contest objective assessments of subjects' experience, allows for a more complex and comprehensive assessment of how to approach, and critique, the Battered Woman Syndrome. It suggests that this can be accomplished by applying the techniques of narrative developed in historical theory to feminist legal theory. It therefore posits that a postmodern methodological approach, realised through a genealogical investigation of the subjectivity of battered women, is of value in the current debate about how to deal with the paradox presented by feminism's engagement with liberalism, and evidenced through the law's assessment of the battered woman who kills.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="subject">Feminist jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/276</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Utilisation: a Cognitive Analysis of How Girls Utilise Drug Information Based on Brookes' Fundamental Equation K[S] + &#8710;I = K[S + &#8710;S]</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The central focus of this study is cognitive information utilisation. Research in information utilisation to date has largely focused on the organisational outcomes of the take up of scientific and professional information in the context of social practice, and the related political, cultural and economic factors affecting this.	Conceptualising information utilisation as a type of organisational change or end-state has tended to mask the complex cognitive exchanges that occur. While there has been increasing acknowledgement that information utilisation is a more holistic interactive change process involving cognitive strategies and transformations, very little research has focused on the cognitive dimension of information utilisation. Bertram Brookes claimed that the theoretical pursuit of information science should be the cognitive interaction between people and information. He explicated this as the Fundamental Equation of information science, most commonly expressed in his writings as K[S] + &#8710;I = K[S + &#8710;S]. By this equation, Brookes was stating that in the process of doing something with information, a person's existing knowledge structure K[S] is changed by an increment of information &#8710;I, and this modification has some effect, a changed knowledge structure K[S + &#8710;S] where &#8710;S indicates the effect of the modification. This equation is posited as an expression of cognitive information utilisation. The specific purpose of this study is to further understanding of cognitive information utilisation, employing Brookes' Fundamental Equation as a general framework for establishing research questions, operational rationalisations and procedures. With a group of four girls in their final year of secondary education, the study sought to: (a) establish the effects &#8710;S of exposure to information perceived by the girls; (b) establish how the perceived effects are associated with changes to their knowledge structures K[S]; and (c) establish the patterns, if any, within and between the girls in relation to changes in knowledge structures and perceived effects (K[S + &#8710;S]). The study employed a quasi-experimental repeated phase approach. The girls' existing knowledge structures about the drug heroin were mapped, and knowledge structures after each of three exposures to different information on heroin were also mapped. Eliciting the girls' knowledge about heroin was based on written discourse and question / answer protocols, and this knowledge was represented as conceptual graph structures, based on an analytical procedure developed by Graesser &amp; Clark (1985). The data were analysed qualitatively to establish indicators and conceptualisations of the perceived effects, and to identify and conceptualise the changed knowledge structures. The study found that the exposures to information and the deliberate consideration of this information had effects for all the girls. Five types of effects were perceived, these being: get a complete picture, get a changed picture, get a clearer picture, get a verified picture, and get a position in a picture. These effects are presented as types of cognitive information utilisation. The knowledge structures after each exposure were shown to change by cognitive strategies of appending, inserting and deleting. The analysis of the knowledge structures associated with these five effects showed that there was coherence between the effects and how these effects were manifested in changes to the girls' knowledge structures. A number of distinct patterns were evident, for example, get a complete picture was associated with revised knowledge structures that were more inclusive, elaborative and integrative. The study raises important implications for information practice, including data base design, information interviews, provision of information in media campaigns, and instructional design. The study also addresses methodological issues and identifies area for further research.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Cognitive psychology</field><field name="subject">Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Drug abuse</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/277</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Dimensions in Water Conservation; An Inter-animation of Writing and Water</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Water is a finite resource which is increasingly valued as a commodity.  This thesis explores the use and appreciation of water, in the context of community response and exchange.  Its focus is a community writing practice, and in particular a project entitled new dimensions in Water Conversation based in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.  This project was a non-crisis driven investigation into a wide range of interests in water.  The central proposition of the thesis is that techno-scientific and broader cultural world views on water rarely connect, and that bringing them together reveals awkward tensions between specialist and non-specialist standpoints.  These disparities are shown in the group writings and outcome of the project, which bring water provision into closer perspective.  A story emerges from the project and its influences.  It is one of material relationships to water over testings, tastings and visits to a water treatment works.  It suggests links which would not normally be anticipated, for example between a regional bulk water supplier and a group of water writers.  The study combines fiction and contemplation with critical analysis and the thesis crosses disciplinary boundaries, drawing on insights from critical cultural theory and the philosophy of science.  The writing is performative rather than accumulative in nature, yet is a concrete record of the interplay between water users and water specialists, in a local and global dimension which includes the Northern Rivers, Australia more generally and Varanasi in India.  Using this transcultural approach, it decentres theory and locates value in the situated contexts and views of different stakeholders in water, which range from sacred values to indifference.  The work calls out for a way of thinking about water that is not yet in the public discourse.  Through the practical connection of the project with an Australian water instrumentality, it draws in developments in contemporary water management, and raises questions and doubts about how instrumentalist and market values have come to dominate imaginings of a global water future.  At the same time it points to the importance of putting the values of the arts and humanities into practice in the increasingly inter-disciplinary environment in which the resource of water is managed and maintained.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">northern rivers</field><field name="subject">community writing</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">cross-culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/279</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiral Architecture for Machine Vision</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis presents a new and powerful approach to the development of a general purpose machine vision system.

The importance of the hexagonal grid is that it possesses special computational features that are pertinent to the vision process. The fundamental thrust of this thesis emanates from the observation that this hexagonal grid can be described in terms of the mathematical object known as a Euclidean ring. The Euclidean ring is employed to generate an algebra of linear transformations which are appropriate for the processing of multidimensional vision data.

Yet, in general, the construction industry continues to degrade the environment, exploiting resources and generating waste, and is reluctant to change its conventional practices to incorporate environmental matters as part of the decisionmaking process. Building development involves complex decisions and the increased significance of external effects has further complicated the situation. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the conventional tools used widely by public and private sectors when appraising projects. It sets out to measure and compare the total costs and benefits of different projects that are competing for scarce resources in monetary terms. However, there are growing concerns that the values of environmental goods and services are often ignored or underestimated in the CBA approach which has led to the overuse and depletion of environmental assets. Consequently, CBA's usefulness and relevance in this respect is increasingly controversial. Project development is not just concerned with financial return, but is also conscious of the long-term impacts on living standards for both present and future generations.  Sustainable development is an important issue in project decision-making and environmental effects need to be incorporated into the evaluation process. A multi- dimensional evaluation approach attracts increasing attention around the world as the way to incorporate environmental issues in the decision-making process. This approach uses the conventional market approach to monetarise economic aspects of a development, whilst using a non-monetary approach to evaluate the environmental matters. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine the impact of construction activities on the environment and methods of quantifying environmental matters. This thesis also evaluates the principal sustainable development determinants for modelling, and evaluating long-term environmental performance of buildings during the project appraisal stage. Projects can be assessed using an index system that combines the principal determinants of sustainable development. The four criteria as identified in this research are financial return, energy consumption, external benefits and environmental impact. The derived sustainability index combines the four identified attributes into a single decision-making tool. The attributes are each expressed in units that are best suited to their quantitative assessment. The development of a sustainability index is a way of combining economic and environmental criteria into the decision-making framework. The sustainability index has also been developed into computer software called SINDEX to be used as a benchmarking tool to aid design and the sustainability assessment of projects. SINDEX is a sustainability modelling tool used to calculate and benchmark sustainable performance of proposed buildings, new and existing facilities.  Conventional project appraisal techniques measure net social gain to select a project, whilst the sustainability index measures the relative ranking of projects from a sustainable development view. Buildings have a long life, so any improvement in appraisal techniques for choosing the best option amongst the alternatives will significantly reduce their future environmental impact. As such, a methodology that embraces various criteria in relation to project development is crucial in this respect.  The development of a sustainability index is a way to combine multiple criteria measured using different units. Using the sustainability index will greatly assist the construction industry to realise sustainable development goals, and thereby make a positive contribution to identifying optimum design solutions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/281</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sport Development Processes in Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with Australian sport policy, specifically sport development in Australia. Therefore, its theoretical origins lie within the discourse of public policy.  While public policy studies are abundant, sport policy research and in particular sport development studies are limited. Hence there is a shortage in the literature on sport development research. Sport nevertheless established itself as a legitimate policy area in Australia in the mid-1970s. Since then, the Federal Government's involvement with sport policy has expanded and nowadays sport in Australia is very much impacted by Federal Government support. However, increased interest and importance placed on sport have not induced corresponding attention from sport policy studies. This study is a first effort to portray the sport development processes as it occurs in the Australian context. In particular, this thesis examines the impact of the Federal Government involvement with sport policy on the sport development processes at a national level. In doing so, this study explores the roles of the key sport development players and the ways sport policies shape sport development processes. Additionally, the study explores the available sport development pathways and the relationships between sport policy players, policies and sport development processes. There have been previous efforts to depict the processes involved with sport development by means of a pyramid that incorporates mass participants at its base and the elite athletes at its peak. This framework provides a very simplistic representation of sport development and does not explicate the embedded processes (Eady, 1993, Shilbury &amp; Deane, 2001). The aforementioned inadequacy of the existing framework to explain sport development led to grounded theory research. Grounded theory is a qualitative research approach formulated by Glaser and Strauss (1967) as a means of generating theory, when existing theoretical frameworks are inadequate to explain a phenomenon, which is embedded in systematically gathered and analysed data (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Bryman, 1988). Strauss and Corbin (1994) argued that if the research question concerns a process, the method of choice for addressing the question is grounded theory. This method led to the constant comparison and coding of data from the Annual Reports of 35 National Sporting Organisations in Australia. These documents covered the years from 1999-2002 (inclusive) and are linked to a Federal Government funding cycle.  Grounded theory research is viewed as 'the foundation for subsequent deductive studies that test out the resulting theory or interventions based on it' (Oshansky, 1996, p. 394). Hence, the model this thesis offers is subject to further empirical testing and future research. The results of the study provide a theoretical framework to understand the Sport Development Processes in Australia. The Sport Development Processes framework illustrates that at the hub of successful sport development there are three major and interrelated requirements: a) Stakeholders, b) Practices and c) Pathways. Sport Development Stakeholders (i.e. governments, sporting organisations and significant others) provide the unity and teamwork necessary for the Sport Development Practices that in turn provide the required Sport Development Pathways. These pathways as the result of sport stakeholder involvement and policy implementation allow Sport Development Processes to occur. According to the Sport Development Processes framework there are three interrelated processes (i.e. Attraction, Retention/Transition, and Nurturing) which involve attracting, retaining and developing the most skilled athletes, building participation and using sport performance to positively influence community involvement with sport. For each process to be successful, a different combination of stakeholder involvement and practices (hence resulting pathways) is necessary. This model provides a unique contribution to the field of sport policy, as it is the first theoretical attempt to fill the void regarding sport development processes. In the process, sport development officers, policy makers and sporting organisations at all levels around Australia are provided with a comprehensive model that assists and advances understanding of sport development processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">processes</field><field name="subject">federal</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/282</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What are the characteristics and driving forces behind the creativity and vision of successful Lebanese immigrants?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Creative visualization is an essential attribute to be possessed by an artist to achieve success in any art endeavour. To reach its purpose in all its fields, art is made manifest and is expressed through real genuine passion. This research study acknowledges Gibran Kahlil Gibran, as a distinguished immigrant artist, with a vision. A comparison is then made of six other artists, including the researcher, who have all had similar ordeals in the successful attainment of their vision.  This biographical, neo-narrative research design methodology was recorded through extensive readings and lengthy interviews, which consisted of proposing specific questions to each of the participants in order to extract valid and comparable findings. As a consequence, the art researcher was able to observe, reflect and draw some relevant conclusions towards the creative vision of Lebanese immigrants, which led to their success despite hardships, expatriation, ambition and hope.  This study has provided the researcher with real insight into the characteristics of these artists and what constitutes a successful immigrant. It has confirmed her pre-conceived perceptions that success takes time and personal effort.  It highlights the importance for the existence of tolerance between people, which in turn will enable the realisation of empathy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">creative ability</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">Lebanese</field><field name="subject">Kahlil Gibran</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/283</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Construction of the Meaning and Significance of an 'Author' among Information Behaviour Researchers. A Social Constructivist approach.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study identifies and explores the social processes that influence the construction by academic researchers of the meaning/s and significance/s of an author and her work prominent in the literature of their field. It examines the construction by 15 information behaviour researchers of Brenda Dervin and her work, using semi-structured interviewing and inductive analysis techniques.  In focussing theoretical attention on social processes, the study seeks to address critiques of prevailing approaches to information behaviour research, such as: a focus on individual cognition at the expense of social and affective factors; a construction of information users defined by their areas of ignorance and uncertainty, rather than their expertise; and a focus on purposive rather than non-purposive information behaviour.  Conceptually, the study has been influenced by a range of theoretical approaches from both information behaviour research and a variety of other disciplines, including Dervin's Sense-Making and Foucauldian discourse analysis.  The study found that participants' initial contact with the author and her work, and the subsequent important events in their relationship, occurred not because of purposeful searching, but rather 'socially' - as a part of non-purposive events and relationships related to the participants' role as academic researchers. The source most frequently discussed by participants was informal discussions with colleagues, and participants' interactions with 'author texts' were commonly mediated by their interpersonal communication. The study found that the significant influences on participants' constructive processes were people and texts with whom they had a long-term relationship.  Participants' constructions of the author and her work were an essentially social process. Their sense-making was inextricably linked to their social context/s: their interactions with their colleagues and mentors; their engagement with the literature and theories of information science and other fields; their research interests and specialisations; and their educational and cultural backgrounds. Participants' constructive processes largely involved elaborating existing constructions - radical changes in construction were both rare and traumatic. Participants' constructions were neither objective nor wholly subjective, but intersubjective - based on shared understandings, conventions and social practices.  Participants' constructive processes had two interdependent aspects: the construction of meaning and the construction of authority (knowledge/power). Participants' informal behaviour, as well as their engagement with formal information sources, involved constructions of authority. Their constructions of the authority of their informant/s determined whether they accepted or rejected the constructions of the author conveyed to them. Participants were able to strategically use shared constructions to add to the credibility and authority of their own work</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social sciences</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/284</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Video Chaos: Multilinear narrative structuration in New Media video practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The presentation of the thesis comprises the Dissertation component (66%) along with the Practice Component and the Practice Report (33%).

The culmination of the Practice Component takes the form of an exhibition and archiving of video works from June 2003 to the date of submission, January 2005.  The Practice Component has been based in the following locations and used resources from Central Queensland University (Bundaberg campus), and The Australian National University, Centre for New Media Arts in Canberra. The practice has examined the topic through the production of the audio-video installation Sugartown and three video works The Hazzards, Nodal Dialectics 1 and boomsplatbangwhack. While these video works exist as discrete media artworks, they also operate as a type of practice process diary for working through the ideas explored in the written dissertation. Even though the video works are not meant to literally 'illustrate' those ideas, they nevertheless explore ways of integrating the theoretical concepts into my own research practice.

Accordingly a promise received in exchange is not enforceable. This is so whether the promise would have the effect of creating a new contract or modifying the terms of an existing contract. The rule has from time to time been the subject of judicial criticism but nevertheless operated with full vigor until 1991. Hitherto, (except in unilateral contract situations) consideration subsisted in the promises made by the parties at the instant of exchange rendering the promises thenceforth mutually enforceable. The contract or the modified contract effectively existed from that time, unconcerned with what the parties hoped to gain from the exchange or what each in fact gained. The English Court of Appeal decision in Williams v. Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls Ltd has the potential to change the law as settled. This dissertation is concerned with the consequences of the decision in the context of promises intended to modify the terms of existing contracts. In Williams v. Roffey the successful promisee gave the promisor no more than an understanding that he would continue to attempt to perform his undertaking under a prior contract. The Court held that the 'practical benefit' that accrued to the promisor from the repetition of the previous promise was sufficient consideration to make the promise of increased payment enforceable. The second promise was made outside the bargaining process and the potential for 'practical benefit' was neither solicited nor offered. The fact that there would be a 'practical benefit' was a deduction made by the Court as a result of questioning counsel for the defendant during the argument of the appeal. The dissertation examines the history of the doctrine of consideration, its incidents, which are said to enable consideration to moderate bargains, and how each is potentially rendered redundant by the decision. As a result of the decision, the role of the court has changed with greater emphasis on the substance of the transaction instead of external characteristics. The superior record keeping methods available to commerce in the 20th century facilitates this change. The following matters seem implicit in the decision. First, the bargaining process has lost its significance in contract modification situations. Second, the courts in determining what is practical and what is not, will find it difficult to avoid investigating the adequacy of consideration. This is an investigation that the courts have steadfastly refused to undertake in the past. The series of Australian authorities commencing with Je Maintendrai v. Quaglia and culminating in The Commonwealth of Australia v. Verwayen are examined. Whilst it is correct to say that those decisions, especially Waltons Stores v. Maher, introduce reliance based liability into the Australian law, the conclusion is reached that extensions to the law of estoppel do not solve the problems arising out of promises that modify existing contracts. This is because detriment to the promisee is necessary to trigger the operation of the law of estoppel and the remedy, being equitable, is discretionary. In contract modification situations the detriment suffered by the promisee is often ethereal and a discretionary remedy (as opposed to enforcing the promise) deprives the transaction of the certainty that is desirable in commercial transactions. The work concludes that, in regard to contract modifications, the doctrine of consideration ceases to perform a useful role and the equitable remedies do not meet the needs of commerce. Accordingly, the suggestion is made that all promises having the effect of modifying an existing contract should be enforceable provided that there is satisfactory evidence that the promise was made and the absence of duress.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contracts</field><field name="subject">consideration (Law)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/286</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Inquiry Into PBNM System Performance Required For Massive Scale Telecommunication Applications</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">PBNM systems have been proposed as a feasible techology for managing massive scale applications including telecommunication service management. What is not known is how this class of system performs under carrier-scale traffic loads. This research investigates this open question and concludes, subject to the considerations herein, this technology can provide services to large scale applications. An in depth examination of several inferencing algorithms is made using experimental methods. The inferencing operation has been implicated as the major source of performance problems in rule based systems and we examine this. Moreover, these algorithms are of central importance to current and future context-aware, pervasive, mobile services. A novel algorithm, JukeBox, is proposed that is a correct, general and pure bindspace conjunctive match algorithm. It is compared to the current state of the art algorithm - Rete. We find that Rete is the superior algorithm when implemented using the hashed-equality variant. We also conclude that IO is an important cause of PBNM system performace limitations and is perhaps of more significance than the implicated inferencing operations. However, inferencing can be a bottleneck to performance and we document the factors associated with this. We describe a generally useful policy system benchmarking procedure that provides a visible, repeatable and measurable process for establishing a policy server's service rate characteristics. The service rate statistics, namely (mu) and (sigma), establish the limitations to policy system throughput. Combined with the offered traffic load to the server, using the statistic (lambda), we can provide a complete characterisation of system performance using the Pollaczek-Khinchine function. This characterisation allows us to make simple design and dimensioning heuristics that can be used to rate the policy system as a whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Based</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/287</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Joint Intensity Algorithms to the Registration of Emission Tomography and Anatomical Images</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In current practice, it is common in medical diagnosis or treatment monitoring for a patient to require multiple examinations using different imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are good at providing anatomical information. Three-dimensional functional information about tissues and organs is often obtained with radionuclide imaging modalities: positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPET). In nuclear medicine, such techniques must contend with poor spatial resolution, poor counting statistics of functional images and the lack of correspondence between the distribution of the radioactive tracer and anatomical boundaries. Information gained from anatomical and functional images is usually of a complementary nature. Since the patient cannot be relied on to assume exactly the same pose at different times and possibly in different scanners, spatial alignment of images is needed. In this thesis, a general framework for image registration is presented, in which the optimum alignment corresponds to a maximum of a similarity measure. Particular attention is drawn to entropy-based measures, and variance-based measures. These similarity measures include mutual information, normalized mutual information and correlation ratio which are the ones being considered in this study. In multimodality image registration between functional and anatomical images, these measures manifest superior performance compared to feature-based measures. A common characteristic of these measures is the use of the joint-intensity histogram, which is needed to estimate the joint probability and the marginal probability of the images. A novel similarity measure is proposed, the symmetric correlation ratio (SCR), which is a simple extension of the correlation ratio measure. Experiments were performed to study questions pertaining to the optimization of the registration process. For example, do these measures produce similar registration accuracy in the non-brain region as in the brain? Does the performance of SPET-CT registration depend on the choice of the reconstruction method (FBP or OSEM)? The joint-intensity based similarity measures were examined and compared using clinical data with real distortions and digital phantoms with synthetic distortions. In automatic SPET-MR rigid-body registration applied to clinical brain data, a global mean accuracy of 3.9 mm was measured using external fiducial markers. SCR performed better than mutual information when sparse sampling was used to speed up the registration process.  Using the Zubal phantom of the thoracic-abdominal region, SPET projections for Methylenediphosponate (MDP) and Gallium-67 (67Ga) studies were simulated for 360 degree data, accounting for noise, attenuation and depth-dependent resolution. Projection data were reconstructed using conventional filtered back projection (FBP) and accelerated maximum likelihood reconstruction based on the use of ordered subsets (OSEM). The results of SPET-CT rigid-body registration of the thoracic-abdominal region revealed that registration accuracy was insensitive to image noise, irrespective of which reconstruction method was used. The registration accuracy, to some extent, depended on which algorithm (OSEM or FBP) was used for SPET reconstruction. It was found that, for roughly noise-equivalent images, OSEM-reconstructed SPET produced better registration than FBP-reconstructed SPET when attenuation compensation (AC) was included but this was less obvious for SPET without AC. The results suggest that OSEM is the preferable SPET reconstruction algorithm, producing more accurate rigidbody image registration when AC is used to remove artifacts due to non-uniform attenuation in the thoracic region. Registration performance deteriorated with decreasing planar projection count. The presence of the body boundary in the SPET image and matching fields of view were shown not to affect the registration performance substantially but pre-processing steps such as CT intensity windowing did improve registration accuracy. Non-rigid registration based on SCR was also investigated. The proposed algorithm for non-rigid registration is based on overlapping image blocks defined on a 3D grid pattern and a multi-level strategy. The transformation vector field, representing image deformation is found by translating each block so as to maximize the local similarity measure. The resulting sparsely sampled vector field is interpolated using a Gaussian function to ensure a locally smooth transformation. Comparisons were performed to test the effectiveness of SCR, MI and NMI in 3D intra- and inter-modality registration. The accuracy of the technique was evaluated on digital phantoms and on patient data. SCR demonstrated a better non-rigid registration than MI when sparse sampling was used for image block matching. For the high-resolution MR-MR image of brain region, the proposed algorithm was successful, placing 92% of image voxels within less than or equal to 2 voxels of the true position. Where one of the images had low resolution (e.g. in CT-SPET, MR-SPET registration), the accuracy and robustness deteriorated profoundly. In the current implementation, a 3D registration process takes about 10 minutes to complete on a stand alone Pentium IV PC with 1.7 GHz CPU and 256 Mbytes random access memory on board.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear medicine</field><field name="subject">Image registration</field><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/288</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of project management mechanisms in software development and their relationship to organisational distance; An emperical investigation</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis describes empirical research into project management of software development.  Specifically, the aim of the research is to investigate how project managers monitor, control and coordinate software development tasks and how this is affected by changing environments, in this case increased organizational distance between the project manager and elements of the project team. Differing project environments allow investigation into which project management mechanisms are essential, which are required in specific circumstances and which may be useful but not necessarily essential.  To explore how software development projects are monitored, controlled and coordinated, a broad range of literature from software development and other fields such as organization theory, supply chain management and automobile manufacture is examined to establish a consensus of the mechanisms of project monitoring, control and coordination and their classification into groups. To better understand how the different mechanisms may be selected in different circumstances, a range of contingencies is examined to deduce which of these contingencies may significantly affect the project management of software development projects. Outsourced and distributed software development projects are becoming more frequent than in the past with consequent effects on project management practices. Although there has been some research into the ways in which project managers monitor, control and coordinate software development projects, little of it has investigated how the mechanisms employed to do so may be affected by such factors as increasing organizational distance. If more were known about the ways in which changed project environments affected the selection and use of project management mechanisms, better responses to those environmental changes could be devised.  This could also identify where tools could be developed to assist project management of outsourced and distributed projects. In this research, the term 'organizational distance' is used to describe the cultural, structural and administrative distance between the project manager and elements of the project team. Since there is limited information available on the concept of organizational distance, a new model is developed that encompasses the dimensions of distance that may be found in outsourced or globally distributed projects. A second model is then developed that relates changes in the factors of organizational distance with preferred choices of project management mechanism via project contingencies. Empirical data were collected by structured interviews with project managers who were currently engaged in software development within Sydney, Australia. The method of collecting the data provided both quantitative and qualitative data that enabled three separate ways to investigate the research questions.  The empirical research found that project managers do not rely on a single mechanism to monitor, control or coordinate a software development project but employ multiple mechanisms.  While the portfolio of mechanisms for both monitoring and control comprised a relatively narrow selection, the portfolio of coordination mechanisms was more diverse. Project monitoring mechanisms were employed to first detect any project problems then to respond to those problems. This contrasts with monitoring systems designed to provide all the information about both the existence and probable causes of project problems.  Project control mechanisms reflected the origin of the control. The constraints imposed on the project by the organization and used by the project manager to direct the project tended to be outcome related, for example budget and schedule. The behaviour of the project team, even across significant organizational distances, was controlled through the use of project plans that determined when different tasks would be performed.  Project coordination mechanisms reflected the different types of dependencies between software development activities. The most common was using a project work breakdown structure, expressed in the project schedule, to resolve sequential and pooled resource dependencies.  Mutual dependencies tended to be resolved using interactive mechanisms such as co-location, conversations and meetings. The empirical evidence did not find any difference between co-located projects and distributed projects so far as the choice of project management mechanisms were concerned. Distributed and globally outsourced software development projects may encounter many difficulties that a fully co-located project does not, but the response to those difficulties appears to lie with the implementation of project management mechanisms and not their selection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Computer</field><field name="subject">Software</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Monitor</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Coordinate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/289</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Organisational Culture, Subculture, Leadership Style and Job Satisfaction on Organisational Commitment</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Despite the large number of studies that have examined the antecedents of organisational commitment, the investigation of the influence of organisational culture and subculture on commitment is noticeably absent. The aim of this thesis is to examine the effects of both organisational culture and subculture on organisational commitment. Other measures which have been shown to be related to either organisational commitment or organisational culture are also included in the study. These are leadership style, job satisfaction and demographic variables such as age, education, years in position and years of experience. Recently, multivariate studies have examined the causal relationships between a variety of different variables and organisational commitment, and a number of these have concluded that the effects of these variables on organisational commitment were mainly mediated by job satisfaction. The data gathered in the present study is examined to determine if it is consistent with job satisfaction fulfilling such a mediating role between commitment and the other variables in the study. Also, a multi-dimensional measure of job satisfaction is employed in the present study and the effects of the different job satisfaction components on commitment are investigated. The subjects used in this study were nurses working in different hospital settings. A questionnaire survey was used which was complemented by semistructured interviews. A total of 398 questionnaires were distributed to nurses in seven hospitals, from which 251 completed questionnaires were returned (63.5% response rate). The sample was obtained from three general public hospitals, two private hospitals and two psychiatric hospitals. Correlational and regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between nurses' commitment to their wards and the other variables measured in the study. A causal model of commitment was developed using a multiple regression analysis in which the role of job satisfaction in mediating the causal link between commitment and the other variables was explored. It was found that organisational subculture had a greater impact on commitment than organisational culture. Innovative and supportive subcultures had a positive effect on commitment and a bureaucratic subculture had a negative effect on commitment. The leadership style variable, consideration, also exerted a relatively strong influence on commitment when compared with other variables included in the study. The results of this study also revealed that the job satisfaction dimensions with the strongest associations with commitment were the control, professionalism and interaction dimensions, which represent intrinsic factors of job satisfaction or those related to higherorder needs in Maslow's (1943) hierarchy. Age showed a direct positive influence on commitment. However, the level of education, years in position and years of clinical experience failed to showed any impact on commitment. Thus, the results of this study are not in agreement with causal models (such as that proposed by Williams and Hazer 1986), in which the influence of various antecedents on commitment are totally mediated via their influence on job satisfaction. The effect of the culture and leadership style variables on commitment was found to be significantly reduced, but not totally eliminated, after statistically controlling for the job satisfaction variables. Finally, in relation to the different hospital groups, the results showed that private hospitals had the strongest bureaucratic ward culture when compared to general public and psychiatric hospitals. The most innovative ward culture was found in general public hospitals and the most supportive ward culture was found in psychiatric hospitals. These findings were contrary to expected outcomes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/290</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of Selective Outsourcing Of Information Technology And Information Services</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study identifies the impacts to the internal Information Technology (IT) department's policies and procedures caused by outsourcing selective IT functions and assesses the threats and opportunities to an internal IT group, presented by outsourcing selective IT functions.  The trend to selectively outsource IT functions implies that this can be done with minimal disruption and risk to the IT departments policies and processes. This research investigates whether this assertion is valid and develops a model for internal IT departments to respond to the challenges presented by selective outsourcing.  Existing models of outsourcing currently in use and available to organizations are reviewed to assess their suitability or adaptability for `selective outsourcing' and from this identifies which areas of internal IT policy and procedures are most impacted. An analysis of the threats and opportunities presented to the internal IT department is also provided.  Research was conducted into one organization's experience with selective outsourcing to investigate how internal IT departments could approach selective outsourcing of internal IT functions and how internal IT departments could develop strategies for responding to the challenges posed by selective outsourcing.  A case study was conducted of a recent selective outsourcing arrangement within the IT group of the target organization. The personal interview method was adopted to survey a cross section of management and staff from the work groups involved in the selective outsourcing arrangement.  The results obtained revolved around the major themes of: 1. Planning (identified as time constraints, resource constraints and work load).  2. Management control (which encompasses the structuring of the outsourcing relationship, human resource concerns, level of ownership, communication, structure of the internal IT group and inter-departmental concerns).  3. Process (which applies to the quality of the procedures, inherent internal knowledge required, the informality of the procedures and concerns over adherence to procedures).  For an IT group to develop strategies to respond to the challenges of selective outsourcing it was identified that the IT group needs to remove internal barriers to process and strive to achieve single ownership of processes within functional work groups; nurture a shift in internal groups thinking to more planning rather than doing; improve the quality of internal IT procedures and implement appropriate project team structures for task specific selective outsourcing engagements and for ongoing vendor relationship management.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic data processing departments</field><field name="subject">Contracting out</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/291</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Counting Maternity: The Measure of Midwifery in Australia, 2002.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The aim of this Professional Doctorate in Midwifery is to challenge the status quo in maternity services through scholarly reflection and research. Through the studies reported here I aim to provide women with information on which to make informed choices about the services available to them, and to ensure politicians become more responsive to the lack of options currently available in Australia. My aim is also to provide measures that would allow maternity service managers to deploy resources more efficiently to achieve the best care.  The majority of the papers in the portfolio are derived from population data that is routinely collected in Australia. One of the cornerstones of healthcare improvement is creating meaningful information and measurement from these collections. True comparisons from accurate data can be used to better understand the nature of the system, and to gauge whether changes have been effective. Thus, the information derived from various collections of routinely collected data is used to measure and evaluate the maternity services. This measures only part of the experience of childbirth, however.  The Doctorate is a collection of nine major works undertaken in the years 1999 to 2002, during my appointment as a research midwife with the Australian Midwifery Action Project (AMAP). The first paper is an essay that tells of the juxtaposition of two different worldviews and the paradigmatic issues that shape the professional differences between obstetrics and midwifery. The second consists of a brief overview of the Australian maternity system described within the terms of reference for a Senate Inquiry into Childbirth Procedures. The third and fourth papers explore the levels of obstetric intervention for low risk women and the cost of these interventions using a new costing model derived from population data. The fifth paper reviews the contemporary issues in the workforce and education of midwives. The sixth paper outlines a proposal for funding reform and a new model of midwifery care. The seventh paper compares midwifery in Australia and New Zealand, in terms of a public health strategy. The eighth paper explores the concept of a new research method called Graffiti; and the final paper continues the theme of measurement in an essay titled 'Evidence based Everything.  The portfolio explores a number of issues around public funding and the call for reform of the maternity services in Australia. In particular it argues for reforms to fund a more responsive service, based on values outlined by women who experience maternity care in Australia, as opposed to those guided by obstetrics and technology who currently set the agenda and determine the way maternity services will be offered and funded.  Although I have articulated and measured some of the characteristics of midwifery and obstetric care in Australia, this disentangling or quantification merely underlies and emphasises the many more continuations and complexities that coexist beyond that, which is 'measured'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/292</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project Pluralism: combining the hard and soft paradigms in IS/IT strategy development in the NSW public sector</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research examines pluralist practice, the combination of methodologies based in different paradigms. Two paradigms are discussed throughout this research, referred to as the hard and soft paradigms. The hard paradigm is commonly associated with positivism and quantitative data, while the soft paradigm is commonly associated with interpretivism and qualitative data. These two paradigms present considerably different perspectives on the world, and methodologies based on these paradigms tend to place different emphases on research and practice. The combination of methodologies from different paradigms presents a number of problems for practice. These include the problem of paradigmatic incommensurability and issues related to practitioner skill diversity, and difficulties in reconciling the different perspectives that are brought to a situation by different methodologies. This research explores pluralist practice through the combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, methodologies which are based on the hard and soft paradigms respectively. The combination of these methodologies is informed by aspects of the Critical Systems Thinking literature, and based on the Embedding model for pluralism. The combination of these methodologies is explored in the context of an IS / IT strategy development project, in the NSW public sector. This project was set within an environment typified by changing stakeholder relationships, abstractly defined and changing goals, and a variety of external influences which altered throughout the course of the project. A combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, based on the Embedding model for pluralism, was used in the management of this project, and resulted in a project which is demonstrated to have provided lasting benefit to the organisation. This is participative, practice based research, and Action Research has been used as the research methodology for this thesis. Action Research has been chosen as a way of linking theory and practice, allowing for the simultaneous development of theory and practice, through cycles of active reflection. The interpretation of research findings has been informed by hermeneutic philosophies. Learning outcomes resulting from this research predominantly relate to the combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, based on the Embedding model. Findings relate to how the problem of paradigmatic incommensurability affects pluralist practice, issues related to the use of tools and techniques governed by paradigms other than that for which they were designed, and specific adaptations that were made in suiting Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology to the needs of the project environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systems.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Paradigms.</field><field name="subject">Project management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/294</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relinquishment and abjection: a semanalysis of the meaning of losing a baby to adoption</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Between 1960 and 1975 more than 38,000 mothers lost babies to adoption in New South Wales, Australia, a pattern which was replicated in other Western societies.  Various theories were proposed for women's exnuptial pregnancies which resulted in their babies being taken for adoption, culminating in the discursive construction of the unmarried mother as 'mad, bad, or stupid'. Until the 1990s, the voices of women whose babies had been taken for adoption had been silenced by the social order which adoption practices served. It is through their voices, and through the voices of other women who remember the era of the adoption bounty, that another meaning for the loss of a baby to adoption, through the process of semanalysis, has been sought.  This thesis is informed primarily by the writings of the French postmodern feminist, Julia Kristeva. In addition the works of the post-structuralist philosopher, Michel Foucault, the German socialist feminist, Frigga Haug, and the American feminist psychologist, Michelle Fine are used as an heuristic lens through which to examine the phenomenon of losing a baby to adoption. A qualitative research methodology, incorporating feminist praxis and feminist multiple methods, has been employed.  The framework for this thesis is that of a double helix which depicts two orders, the symbolic and the semiotic, which intertwine and intersect. The symbolic order is analogous to the public social order which through its hegemonic discourses constructed the unmarried mother and adoption. The semiotic order refers to the personal space where the voices of women are heard through counterdiscourses. At the scission of the two helical strands sits the thetic phase, a point of rupture by the semiotic into the symbolic where the voices of mothers are expressed through their poetry and art.  Through the process of semanalysis, the tensions which simultaneously resist and challenge the semiotic and symbolic orders are exposed: tensions between discourse, discipline and docility; power and knowledge; sexuality and silence; power of / as sexuality; power and resistance; and resistance and / as silence. Furthermore, I examine the manifestations of mothers' resistance to silence, and their resistance as activism.  My concluding analysis involves the notion of abjection as it binds together the threads of the loss of a baby to adoption: abjection as entrapment; abjection as infertility; and abjection as / in reunion. For mothers who lost babies to adoption, their loss finds meaning in the ultimate horror: it is abjection.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Unmarried mothers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/295</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structured graphs: a visual formalism for scalable graph based tools and its application to software structured analysis</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Very large graphs are difficult for a person to browse and edit on a computer screen. This thesis introduces a visual formalism, structured graphs, which supports the scalable browsing and editing of very large graphs. This approach is relevant to a given application when it incorporates a large graph which is composed of named nodes and links, and abstraction hierarchies which can be defined on these nodes and links. A typical browsing operation is the selection of an arbitrary group of nodes and the display of the network of nodes and links for these nodes. Typical editing operations is: adding a new link between two nodes, adding a new node in the hierarchy, and moving sub-graphs to a new position in the node hierarchy. These operations are scalable when the number of user steps involved remains constant regardless of how large the graph is. This thesis shows that with structured graphs, these operations typically take one user step. We demonstrate the utility of structured graph formalism in an application setting. Computer aided software engineering tools, and in particular, structured analysis tools, are the chosen application area for this thesis, as they are graph based, and existing tools, though adequate for medium sized systems, lack scalability. In this thesis examples of an improved design for a structured analysis tool, based on structured graphs, is given. These improvements include scalable browsing and editing operations to support an individual software analyst, and component composition operations to support the construction of large models by a group of software analysts. Finally, we include proofs of key properties and descriptions of two text based implementations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer software development</field><field name="subject">graphic methods</field><field name="subject">computer programs</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/296</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To what extent is the deep enjoyment of flow experienced in primary classroom learning, and under what teaching and learning conditions might the deep enjoyment of flow be facilitated ?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The primary purposes of this research were to identify if and how a selected teacher and her class experience deep enjoyment as flow in the classroom, and if they do have that experience, to investigate the teaching and learning factors that facilitate that deep enjoyment.  In particular this research had the following three aims:  1.	to explore the conditions and activities that are identifiable in learner's perceptions of their deep enjoyment or flow in learning. 2.	to identify the component characteristics of flow articulated in the learners' stories about their enjoyable learning experiences. 3.	to identify and examine perceptions of deep enjoyment or flow in learning in teacher practice and student learning through a teacher's stories of her teaching experience and through classroom observations.  The research involved a case study of a teacher in a state school Year 5/6 classroom, and seventeen of her students.  Qualitative data were collected from interviews with the teacher, interviews with the students, and field observations recorded in the researcher's journal over a period of several months.  These data, analysed by using the NUD*IST software, provide valuable insight into how the teacher and her students perceive their teaching and learning experiences.  The children and their teacher do experience enjoyment, often the deep enjoyment of flow in their classroom.  A classroom culture was identified that includes teaching characteristics, environmental, and instructional variables, which help facilitate deeply enjoyable flow in meaningful learning. This research concludes that the intellectual knowledge is available which will make flow facilitating classroom cultures achievable.  Achieving such a classroom culture is possible when educators identify and value the enjoyment of flow, with its subsequent sense of learner control, confidence, success, well-being, energy and motivation to learn.  To do this, educators need to identify and implement the teaching and learning strategies available that facilitate the experience, with the intention of ensuring recurrent learner success from the early years of school attendance.  Such a change in the educational ethos would lead to successful, enjoyable and vibrant learning experiences for teacher and learner in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational psychology</field><field name="subject">Classroom management</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/297</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception of Change in Education, Training and Development in the NSW Police Service, Post the Wood Royal Commission</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study examined the perception held by members of the NSW Police Service as to the effectiveness of changes made to education, training and development, post the recommendations made by the Wood Royal Commission in 1997.  The Commission report highlighted a number of important education, training and development issues.  The literature on policing indicated that police jurisdictions have a need to both anticipate and respond to changes and events occurring in the communities they serve.  This study thus examined both the general and police literature covering change, culture, management and leadership, professionalisation and the main education, training and development topics that were included in the Commission report.  An historical scan of developments within the NSW Police Service was also made.  The study basically adopted an empirical, quantitative research methodology, supplemented by qualitative statements made by participants during discussion sessions.  Two separate questionnaires were developed: one for respondents in the broader NSW Police Service (one city and one rural region), and the other for sworn officers and academic staff at the NSW Police Academy.  The Service questionnaire addressed participant perception of the effectiveness or otherwise, of changes made in relevant aspects of individual, team and organisational learning.  Opportunity was also taken to analyse responses to the Service questionnaire, based on a range of selected demographic characteristics.  The Academy questionnaire addressed the perceptions held about the effectiveness or otherwise, of changes made in general learning issues, curriculum development, course delivery and the evaluation of training.  An analysis of combined responses to like questions in both the Service and Academy questionnaires was also made.  Both Pre and Post Royal Commission perceptions, as recorded on a five point Likert scale were collected.  From the resulting mean difference scores potential change in the respondent's perception of the effectiveness of the changes made were determined.  The findings indicated that respondents perceived some improvement in the effectiveness of education, training and development Post the Wood Royal Commission.  There were some important findings related to: (a) perceived differences between the formal Academy recruit training and probationer practicum or field training; (b) the need for 'Professionalisation' Vs 'Craft' training; (c) leadership role models of learning and the creation of a learning culture and climate; (d) the role of knowledge management in intelligence-led and evidence-based policing; (e) the use of information technology and distance learning strategies; (f) the development of reflective practice and the gaining of lessons learnt from experience; (g) the provision of leadership development; (h) support for continuing professional development, as a part of fostering self-managed lifelong learning and, (i) the consistent Quality Assurance review of both the course curriculum and evaluation of training effectiveness at the Academy.

Although the limited ecological research to date indicates that the nearshore volumes of sandy beach systems may be as biologically productive as estuaries and wetlands, the management of sandy beaches has not been based on ecological or sustainability principles.  In this study, the principles and goals of ecologically sustainable development (ESD) are applied in investigations designed to develop improved ecological and recreational management of metropolitan sandy beach ecosystems, whereby ecological functions are maintained simultaneously with recreational and related uses.  The conventional view that sandy beaches are resilient to recreational use, and are more likely to be seriously impacted by other forms of human activity, seems to have precluded serious research investigation of questions such as: what are the responses of both beach biota and human users to environmental variables influencing the system; what are the simultaneous levels, distributions and diversity of beach biota in relation to levels, distributions and categories of beach users; and what ecological impacts are likely from human beach use on biota at points of interaction, temporally and spatially? From the first section of the project, it has been shown that our present understanding of the functions, processes and responses to human disturbances of sandy beach ecosystems is extremely poor, compared with that of rock platforms. New methodologies have been developed in the current study for experimental investigations into aspects of sandy beach ecology and recreational use which have never previously been considered. Relationships between environmental variables and categories of beach use have been quantified, and show promise for use in predictive modelling to guide management.  Current approaches to the management of sandy beaches and beach recreation, as aspects of environmental and coastal resource management, were then critically examined. The structures, functions and decision-making procedures of the major spheres of government, and their management agencies, were evaluated and found to provide inherent obstacles to effective ecological and recreational management of ecosystems. Coastal resource and beach management by public agencies were assessed for Durban and Sydney. Comparative analysis has provided information that can be used to develop guidelines for integrated ecologial and recreational management of sandy beach systems. In a synthesis of all of the above findings, a new procedural model has been constructed, for sustainable ecological and recreational management of sandy beach systems. This model is proposed as a framework for future integrated coastal resource research and management.

Modifying rivers has brought great benefit to communities, fulfilling important community goals - supporting profitable commercial activities and providing a basis for vibrant communities. However modifying rivers has also had negative consequences - in particular, a decline in the quality and quantity of water. These impacts have undermined valued aspects of rivers (such as fish habitat) and have also caused decline in commercial activities (such as fishing and floodplain grazing).  This thesis explores the ways that these contending perceptions of modification work out on the ground in rural communities. How are the benefits of modification recognised? How are the negative consequences of modification noticed and measured? Under what conditions are the benefits of modification reassessed? These are important questions in the current moment as our society reassesses the past modification of rivers and attempts to move towards more sustainable use of natural resources. This thesis explores this topic by undertaking in depth case-studies of two distinctive riverine environments: one coastal, the Clarence River in luscious coastal northern New South Wales; and one inland, the Balonne River, at the top of the Murray-Darling Basin, in semi-arid south-west Queensland. The case studies explore responses to modification of the rivers in two periods: the post-war decades - a time of widespread support for modification, and recent decades - a time of widespread recognition of the negative consequences of development. The thesis investigates perceptions of modification at three different scales: (i) groups within localities - the ways that modification is perceived by local groups with contrasting physical and conceptual interactions with the rivers (such as graziers, fishers, irrigators, Aboriginal people, ecologists and engineers); (ii) regional communities - which are constituted by groups with differing interests, and (iii) governments - which have the role of managing the long-term health of the economy and the environment, despite the long-term goals often being contested.  This thesis provides insights into the ways that our complex society grapples with the possibility, and effects, of modifying the natural environment. This thesis suggests that local conditions - the actual local physical environment and local social conditions - shape the ways that modification of rivers is supported, challenged and reassessed. However, both local social conditions and the environment are constantly changing, often in surprising ways. Therefore outcomes are always an interaction between different levels of interest groups and the environment itself.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/300</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-conceptualising Competency-based Education and Training : with particular reference to education for occupations in Australia.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The thesis that emerges from the publications nominated for examination, is that a holistic or integrated competency based approach to vocational education and training (VET) and professional education (both initial and continuing) has many advantages over traditional approaches: * It provides a curriculum framework which links practice to theory in more coherent ways than currently exist; * It potentially provides a way of breaking the old dichotomy between 'knowing that' and 'knowing how' which has characterised Anglo-Saxon education and which has resulted in the belief that education which is practical is both different from and inferior to that which is abstract; * It provides the basis for teaching and learning approaches which could enhance students' adaptability and flexibility over their lives; * It has the potential for developing in occupational education more valid assessment strategies than those traditionally used and also for reducing the deleterious effects on learning of measurement-based assessment approaches. In summary, it is argued that the integrated approach to competency-based education provides a conceptual base for the competency movement and a promising direction for educational reform for all levels of occupational education. It is further argued that competency standards developed through an integrated approach can facilitate the implementation of a number of other areas of social and economic policy, such as the recognition of qualifications of overseas professionals in Australia, and the internationalisation of professional services.  Overview of the publications  The publications span a six-year period from 1990 to 1996. The first of them was written at a time when there was very little literature in the area (and virtually none in Australia) and when there was a great deal of confusion about the nature of competency, how to develop competency standards and the implications of the competency approach for education and training. What literature did exist, was mostly twenty years old and was largely a reaction against educational curricula which, it was felt, had failed to adequately prepare students for occupations or for life more generally. In place of a curriculum based on the acquisition of knowledge most of the critics suggested that curriculum should be based on an analysis of what people needed to do. Conceptually, as Wolf (1995) and others have pointed out, it was based on a niave reductionism arising out of behaviourist approaches to education. This approach was quite powerful for a brief period in the 1970s in teacher education programs in the United States. However the challenge to behaviourism from cognitive and humanist approaches to learning seemed to undermine the conceptual basis of the competency movement and very little was written about competency approaches until the late 1980s.  As Raven (1996) has recently pointed out, the literature on competency-based education which has appeared recently is also a reaction against 'something that is sensed to be wrong' (p.74). But what this is, what needs to be achieved and how this could be done is not clear. He suggests that the contemporary competency literature lacks a conceptual and analytical base and that there is little recognition of the need for a research program which develops a better understanding of the nature of competence, how it might be developed in individuals, how it might be assessed and what impact this would have on individuals, organisations and society generally. It is these issues that the publications submitted for examination have addressed. They have attempted to provide a conceptual base for competency-based education and a framework for how competency might be developed and assessed. Much of the recent literature in Australia has built on the approach which the publications originated.  The publications can be divided into those dealing with the nature of competency, particularly the integrated model, (a, b, d, e) those dealing with curriculum and teaching issues (b, j) and those dealing with assessment of competence (c, f, h, i, k). The theme which unites them, is the integrated approach to competency and its capacity to provide a coherent framework for improved educational practices in all occupational education. Another possible way of categorising the publications would be by educational level. For reasons associated with the traditional division of labour in our workforces we tend to think about the differences between educational levels rather than the similarities. It is usual to think about higher education for example, even when it prepares people for occupations, as substantially different from other occupational education. This is underlined by the fact that there is no term, in common usage, to encompass both what is currently referred to as middle level or vocational education, and education for the professions. Despite its specific nature, professional education is often identified with academic and general education, while vocational education is identified with practical education and is assumed to be devoid of substantial theoretical content. In fact much of higher education for the professions is practical and much vocational education is grounded in theory, even if it is not always made explicit. A conclusion which I believe can be drawn from these publications as a whole is that the difference between higher education for the professions and vocational education for middle level occupations is one of degree rather than one of kind. Obviously most professional work is more complex than work at, say, trades level. But it is better to conceptualise these levels on a continuum rather than to see them as essentially different. There will be many instances when professionals need to do things which are routine where simple competencies are used. Conversely many tradespeople will need to use complex combinations of competencies to solve challenging problems. Hence, it is not useful to divide the publications into those dealing specifically with the professions (of which there are six- a, b, c, d, g, i) and those dealing with issues relevant to all sectors of education (of which there are five- e, f, h, j, k). What the publications have to say about the nature of competency, how to develop competency through curricula and teaching and how to assess it, is broadly applicable to all occupational education irrespective of the context in which it is discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competency based education</field><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/303</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived experience of laterlife computer learners</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Older adults of the 21st century have not grown up with information and communication technology and may not have used computers in their working lives. However, they have experienced the many technological changes of the 20th century. Some changes have fundamentally altered communication, entertainment, and the kinds of knowledge and skills that are sought and valued. These changes are difficult to ignore because of their pervasiveness. In order to actively participate in their lifeworlds older adults face an imperative to adapt and meet new challenges.  The purpose of this research was to investigate and interpret the lived experience of laterlife computer learners in non-formal learning environments. The research focused on the interpretation and understanding of the learning experience from the perspective of participants. Hence there is an ontological thread that is grounded in the lifeworld of older adults in Sydney, Australia. A hermeneutic phenomenological methodology was considered suitable because of its emphasis on understanding the lived experience of humans. A qualitative method was used in this study because it enabled existential insights into the learning experience from the perspective of learners and privileged their voices.  Fourteen older adults volunteered to participate and were interviewed. Participants identified themselves as laterlife beginning computer learners. Interviews were audio-taped and analysed using an interpretative case study approach. Other analytic tools used were grounded theory, thematic analysis and narrative inquiry. Existential themes were identified and interpreted within a framework of wellbeing.  The research found that participants engaged in learning optimistically and that they believed in their abilities and also in the worth of the learning they were undertaking. The learners believed the outcomes from learning would lead to greater opportunity for participation in their lifeworld. Without computer skills and knowledge they believed they would be ignored and relegated to a peripheral position as observers in their lifeworld. By undertaking learning they believed they were taking control of their current and future lives, acting in defiance of developmental theories that suggested ageing was a stage of life and not a process. However, the sense of agency and purpose was not without its pressures and hurdles and learning was perceived to be difficult, dynamic, frustrating and immensely satisfying. Their purposes and expectations were situated in the changing nature of the world and a desire to continue to live their lives authentically, as participants and not spectators. Laterlife computer learners in this study were seen to be learning and growing their lives into a future of their making.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">continuing education</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/304</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and Object Modularity Description and Measurement</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Software measurement has been of interest to software engineers for almost as long as software has been developed. While the evolution of systematic processes of software development has seen a trend away from reliance on the expertise of individual software developers alone to ensure software quality, systematic processes of software measure development have not evolved to a similar extent. The problem with defining software measures according to an informal process is that the quality of measures can be highly dependent on the expertise of the individual measure developers. If a systematic process of software measure development were defined, that promoted transparency and objectivity in measure development, then this systematic process could support the development of high quality measures by less expert users. In this thesis, a systematic process of software descriptive measure development is described and demonstrated. The approach taken to defining this systematic process is to investigate the various processes by which currently available software descriptive measures have been developed. These processes are then amalgamated with an established systematic method of measure development used in the field of social science. Applying the stages of measure development thus identified to the task of developing measures to describe C++ class and object modularity tests the feasibility of this measure development process. Insights gained through this testing provide feedback to further refine the process. In this way, a systematic process of descriptive software measure development is defined alongside the definition of a set of measures that provide a detailed description of the complex software characteristic of modularity. The products of each stage of this measure development process assist a user to validate the measures with respect to an intended application, and to analyse and interpret the measurement data obtained by applying the measures to a software system. This is demonstrated in a case study that also provides an indirect indication of the quality of the process by which the measures were developed. The major contribution of this work is the systematic process of descriptive software measure development, as it has a wide application and can be used to develop measures to describe many software characteristics of interest. A second important contribution is made by the set of measures of C++ class and object modularity developed to demonstrate this systematic descriptive measure development process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">Object Oriented Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/306</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Practitioner Researcher perspective on facilitating an open, infinite, chaordic simulation. Learning to Engage with Theory while Putting Myself Into Practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis investigates two intertwined themes. The first concerns the development of a framework for understanding, and making appropriate use of, simulations and games as tools for learning. The second concerns the utilisation of the term PractitionerResearcher to reflect the unity of practice and research activity in creating 'working knowledge' (Symes 2000). These themes are intertwined in the sense that the route I take to understanding simulations and games is through the stance of a PractitionerResearcher. Conversely the thesis aims to draw out what it means to be a PractitionerResearcher through my engagement as a facilitator of simulations and games. I argue that the knowledge I generate as a PractitionerResearcher is utilitarian and pragmatic.  Grounded in my practice as an adult educator it utilises theoretical perspectives chosen for immediate relevance rather than because of any claims to 'truth' or permanence. Understanding how this shapes and influences my practice was a complex, difficult process. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, Chapter 1 outlines the development of my 'working knowledge' as a PractitionerResearcher. It draws on selected personal experiences in my work as an adult educator using simulations and games for teaching and learning. While curiosity about historical facts initiated the research reported in Chapter 2, the chapter focuses on uses of historical precedent for generating greater understanding, and acceptance by participants, of simulations and games as teaching/learning strategies. It identifies a range of contributions - from war games, religious games, and children's play - to the structuring of modern educational simulations and games. Chapter 3 explores approaches to classifying simulations and games. Its development brought a gradual realisation of the futility of trying to establish a single definitive categorisation system for all simulations and games. Understanding how they can be arranged in a variety of different relationships provides a better insight into their general features and helps in making decisions about when and how to use specific activities. One outcome of the work for this chapter was the realisation of some simulations as 'open and infinite' in nature, and that XB - simulation of importance in my practice - is such a simulation. Chapter 4 uses concepts developed in the field of chaos theory to illustrate how certain simulations create messy but 'chaordic' (Hock 2002) rather than dis-orderly learning contexts. 'Chaos/chaotic' once meant only dis-order, 'messiness' and unpredictability. Twentieth century scientific discoveries illustrate that order is concealed within 'chaos' producing richly complex patterns when viewed from the right perspective. I argue that 'chaos' concepts can be usefully applied to open and infinite simulations to demonstrate how they are similarly 'chaordic'. XB (for eXperience Based learning) is an open, infinite chaordic simulation, and has been a driving force in my practice for six years. The case study in Chapter 5 introduces the 'world according to XB' and takes the reader 'inside' participants' experiences as the unfolding nature of their learning is revealed in the way they apply theories of organisational behaviour to immediate behaviours. Chapter 6 reflects on my experiences of facilitating XB, via a review of interactions with some past XB participants. The influence of such a learning process on my practice is analysed. The emotional impact of these interactions has brought a better understanding of my own practice, and the chapter considers the concept of 'dispassionate reflexivity' as an aid for the facilitator in such contexts. Chapter 7 examines the evolution and distinctive features of the PractitionerResearcher in more detail. As an educator, a consistent focus of my work has been simultaneously 'to know more' and 'to be able to do better' - and it is the interdependence of these that lies at the heart of what it means to be a PractitionerResearcher. It is my hope that this thesis offers a solution for practitioners wanting to combine 'research' and 'practice' into a practical and scientifically rigorous 'whole'. For such professionals the PractitionerResearcher model offers an integrated approach, combining and validating 'learning in action' and 'learning for action'.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Practitioner</field><field name="subject">Researcher</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Educational games</field><field name="subject">Simulation games</field><field name="subject">Working knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/308</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising information use: managers and their work</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is information use. Although a key concept in information behaviour, information use has received little attention from information science researchers. Studies of other key concepts such as information need and informationseeking are dominant in information behaviour research. Information use is an area of interest to information professionals who rely on research outcomes to shape their practice. There are few empirical studies of how people actually use information that might guide and refine the development of information systems, products and services.  The thesis begins to address this imbalance in information behaviour research by exploring the concept of information use through an empirical study. Fifteen senior managers from two organisations in the cultural industries sector participated in the study. Analysis of interviews revealed that the managers understood and experienced information use in five different ways: as information packaging; as information flow; as developing new knowledge and insights; as shaping judgements and decisions; and as influencing others.  These five different ways of experiencing information use are related in a hierarchy that reflects three different views of information: as an object; as a construct; and as a transformative force. Embedded in the hierarchy are different relations between people and information in their work environments, different processes of information use and different criteria for determining the quality of information that is used.  The thesis demonstrates that the concept of information use can be explored empirically using phenomenography as the research approach. This approach, which originated in the field of education, has been used infrequently in information behaviour research. It offers potential for the further exploration of not only information use but also other concepts germane to information behaviour. The thesis highlights the richness of peoples' experiences of information use and points to some directions that might be taken by practitioners in developing information systems, products and services to support people as they 'go about their business'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Corporations</field><field name="subject">Information services</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/309</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History in Australian popular culture : 1972-1995</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">As cultural studies has consolidated its claim to constitute a distinct field of study in recent years, debate has intensified about its characteristic objects, concepts and methods, if any, and, therefore, its relationship to traditional disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. In History in Australian Popular Culture 1972-1995, I focus on an intersection of cultural studies with history. However, I do not debate the competing claims of 'history' and 'cultural studies' as academic projects. Rather, I examine the role played by historical discourse in popular cultural practices, and how those practices contest and modify public debate about history; I take 'historical discourse' to include argument about as well as representation of the past, and so to involve a rhetorical dimension of desire and suasive force that varies according to social contexts of usage. Therefore, in this thesis I do cultural studies empirically by asking what people say and do in the name of history in everyday contexts of work and leisure, and what is at stake in public as well as academic 'theoretical' discussion of the meaning and value of history for Australians today. Taking tourism and television ('public culture') as my major research fields, I argue that far from abolishing historical consciousness -- as the 'mass' dimension of popular culture is so often said to do -- these distinct but globally interlocking cultural industries have emerged in Australian conditions as major sites of historical contestation and pedagogy. Tourism and television are, of course, trans-national industries which impact on the living-space (and time) of local communities and blur the national boundaries so often taken to define the coherence of both 'history' and 'culture' in the modern period. I argue, however, that the historical import of these industries includes the use of the social and cultural spaces they make available by people seeking to publicise their own arguments with the past, their criticisms of the present, and their projects for the future; this usage is what I call 'popular culture', and it can include properly historical criticism of the power of tourism and television to disrupt or destroy a particular community's sense of its past. From this it follows that in this thesis I defend cultural studies as a practice which, far from participating in a 'death' or 'killing' of history, is capable of accounting in specific ways for the liveliness of historical debate in Australia today.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Popular culture</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Civilization</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/310</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language diversity and linguistic identity in Brittany: a critical analysis of the changing practice of Breton</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways in which linguistic diversity is represented, articulated and theorised in the context of the promotion of Breton, a minority or lesser-used language spoken in the region of Brittany in western France. In doing so it seeks to provide a critical analysis of the changing practice of Breton and the different ways in which the language is mobilised as a vehicle for personal and collective identity. It provides a historical reading of the development of a sense of Breton identity through the language, locating the changing practice of Breton, particularly following the revival movement that began in the 1960s, in a socio-political and socio-cultural context.  In tracking these functional and symbolic transformations of Breton, the thesis takes a theoretical approach that can broadly be described as belonging to the discipline of critical language studies. Working from this critical perspective, it explores the way different language ideologies frame issues of linguistic diversity and examines the way notions of language, linguistic diversity and identity are epistemologically constructed. In doing so it argues the need for greater critical awareness of the effects these ideologies may have on diversity, with a view to developing more effective ways of promoting diverse language practices and linguistic identities in Brittany.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breton</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">Brittany</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/312</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space Efficient Visualisation of Large Hierarchies</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Relational information visualisation concerns viewing relational data, where the underlying data model is a graph. Hierarchical visualisation is one of hot topics in graph visualisation in which the data is organised in a hierarchical structure. As the amount of information, that we want to visualise, becomes larger and the relations become more complex, classical visualisation techniques and hierarchical drawing methods tend to be inadequate.Traditional hierarchical visualisation algorithms are more concerned with the readability of the layouts. They usually do not consider the efficient utilisation of the geometrical plane for the drawings. Therefore, for most hierarchical layouts, a large portion of display space is wasted as background. The aim of this research is to investigate a space-efficient approach to handle the visualisation of large hierarchies in two-dimensional spaces. This thesis introduces a new graph visualisation approach called enclosure+ connection for visualizing large hierarchies. This approach maximises the space utilisation by taking advantages of the traditional enclosure partitioning approach, while it retains the display of a traditional node-link diagram to hopefully provide users a direct perception of relational structures. The main contribution of this thesis is layout and navigation algorithms for visualising large hierarchies. Two layout algorithms, the space-optimised tree and the EncCon tree, have been developed to achieve the space-efficient visualisation. Both algorithms use the enclosure concept to define layout of hierarchies, which ensure the efficient utilisation of display space. Two focus+context navigation and interaction methods have been proposed to cooperate with the visualization of large hierarchies. Several advanced computer graphics approaches, such as graphic distortion and transparency, are used for the development of these navigation methods.  Two case studies have been implemented to evaluate the layout algorithms and the associated navigation methods. The first case study is an application of a shared collaborative workspace which aims to provide users with a better assistance for visual manipulation and navigation of knowledge-based information. The second case study is a visual browser for navigating large-scale online product catalogues.  Although the case studies have provided some useful evaluation, formal usability studies would be required to justify fully the effectiveness of these layout and navigation methods. Although this task has not carried out in this research, the author has presented his usability study's plan as a future work.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visualisation</field><field name="subject">Trees (graph theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/315</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not Quite/ Just the Same/ Different: the Construction of Identity in Vietnamese War Orphans Adopted by White Parents</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Global diasporas caused by wars carry many streams of people - in the 1970s one of these streams contained orphans from Vietnam delivered to white parents in the West.  On arrival, the social expectation was that these children would blend seamlessly into the culture of their adoptive parents.  Now some adoptees, as adults, reflect on their lives as 'Asian' or racially 'Other' children in white societies, charting the critical points in their maturation.  This thesis interrogates their life histories to explore the role of birth-culture in the self-definition of people removed from that culture at birth or in childhood.  Thirteen adult adopted Vietnamese participants were interviewed.  These interviews provided qualitative data on issues of racial and cultural identity.  These data were developed and analysed, using a framework drawn from symbolic interactionism and cultural studies, in order to reveal the interpersonal dynamics in which people were involved, and the broader cultural relations that sustained them.  The findings reveal that in early childhood the adopted Vietnamese identity process was shaped by a series of identifications with, and affirmations of, sharing their adoptive parents racial and cultural identity.  Such identifications were then challenged once the adoptees entered society and were seen by others as different.  The participants' attempts to locate a secure sense of self and identity within the world they are placed in are disturbed by numerous uncertainties surrounding racial and cultural difference.  One of the most crucial uncertainties is the adopted Vietnamese knowledge about their cultural background.  While most felt they lacked positive knowledge about Vietnam and racial diversity, their sense of identity was unsettled by experiences with racism and negative cultural stereotypes throughout their late childhood to adolescence.  As their recognition and acceptance of their difference develops in adulthood, they experience a degree of empowerment due to their being able to access more knowledge about their cultural background and a greater appreciation of racial diversity.  Many participants have formed closer ties with other people born in Vietnam, most notably other adoptees; most returned to visit Vietnam.  The thesis concludes that those adoptees who were able to develop an understanding of the Vietnamese and other backgrounds to their complex identities, tended to be more integrated as adults than those who either rejected or were unable to come to terms with their Vietnamese ancestry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Social inquiry</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Cultural adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/316</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fantasy of Exile : Some reflections on the margins of the 'Unhomely Consciousness'</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is about exile, but exile of a particular nature. I take the term exile discursively and textually, with no particular regard to historical specificities it may offer. In this sense I intend to use the concrete to render the abstract, working backwards from the historically and generally recognised condition of exile - the relegated, the diasporic - to its discursive relocation in various forms of narrative, reflection and representation. In this the measure of the exile will be the continuities re d discontinuities of the discourses of its location.  The thesis will argue that the exilic subject - that is, the subject of modern consciousness - is the product of a certain fantasy formation of a subjective homeland projected onto the various margins of discourse, history and geography. This fantasy leads to a fascination and identification of things perceived at the margins or the bounds of a psychopathological homeland, rendering the homeland itself the site of alienation. The thesis argues against the positioning of the subject as alienated 'lack' in favour of a subjective and representative plenitude. The thesis will look to various discourses alienation and ideology, with a particular focus on the philosophy of reflection, phenomenology and psychoanalytic theory (the philosophy of the 'unreflected') to trace a sort of exilic affectability that inheres in the representation of the modern subject.  The introductory chapter 'Parenthesis' picks at the relation between the discourses of post-structuralist and post-colonial theory, looking to their fascination with the margins and positing a certain intellectual and political tendency to fantasy. Chapters One and Two explore the problem of representation in these discourses with particular emphasis on the disposition of the subject and its relation to its own reading or metaphysical positioning, taking as its metaphor the representation: relation between the map and the territory. Chapters Three and Four look to the ontogenesis of the subject of exile and its reflective and metaphysical positioning in representation. Chapter Five closes the thesis with an exposition on the fantasy of subjective and representative closure. The fantasy of exile as the fantasy of closure proper.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exile (punishment) in Literature</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/318</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birthing business in the Bush: It's time to listen.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The challenge of ameliorating or preventing the health problems of Indigenous Australians living in remote areas is compounded by the profound professional, cultural, social and personal isolation of the health professionals who work there. This isolation has direct effects on the recruitment and retention of health professionals to remote communities, and their ability to work effectively in this unfamiliar environment. The overarching goal of this research was to strengthen the capacity of these professionals to improve the quality of remote area maternity services in Australia and the experiences and outcomes for birthing women and their families. This was achieved by investigating a process of engagement with a wide range of stakeholders and utilising contemporary communication technology through the Internet. A case study approach was undertaken using participatory action research (PAR) with the elements off rapid assessment, response and evaluation methods (RARE). The research explored, described and analysed the development of resources aimed at decreasing isolation and increasing communication in the remote setting. Identifying the barriers, facilitators and utility of an information technology intervention was an integral part of the investigation process. The first case study saw the development and evaluation of the Maternity Care in the Bush Web Based Resource Library, designed to decrease the isolation of practitioners from the educational resources and professional expertise available in current literature, guidelines and reports. The second case study targeted isolation from peers, with the development and evaluation of the Remote Links Online Community. This was designed to build partnerships between isolated practitioners, for the purpose of interactive peer support, information exchange and mentoring. The third and fourth case studies were guided by Aboriginal researchers and resulted in the development of the Birthing Business in the Bush Website, designed to decrease practitioners' isolation from cultural knowledge. An integrated component of this Website is the Primary Health Care Guide to Planning Local Maternity Services, designed to decrease the isolation of the health care practitioner from the community in which they are working. Issues related to conducting research in the Australian Indigenous setting have been explored, analysed and detailed. Each case study contributed new knowledge and learning about the challenges and contemporary contexts of remote area maternity service provision in Australia. The use of PAR, and, most particularly, how this can be used in Indigenous research to produce goals that extended beyond the individual researcher's goals, has been described. The current difficulties associated with computer mediated communication, as experienced by remote practitioners, have been highlighted. The research has identified areas of need within the workforce that, if addressed, could contribute to improved health services.  Importantly, the research has documented, acknowledged, honoured and disseminated the voices of Aboriginal women, through the far reaching communication technology that is the Internet. Furthermore, the voices, concerns and conditions of remote maternity services providers were also documented and acknowledged. This workforce, often invisible and poorly valued, was assisted and supported to provide evidenced based, culturally appropriate maternity care, through the resources that were developed. To further progress the lessons taken from the research, recommendations have been developed and are listed in the Conclusion.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">indigenous health</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/320</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perspectives on Learning and Information in Flexible Learning Environments</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study explores the perspectives of teachers and learners in flexible learning environments in relation to information and learning, and the implications of these perspectives for the design of effective library and information services. It adopted a case study methodology to investigate three flexible learning academic subjects offered at the University of Wollongong in Autumn Semester (March to June) 2000. Using a contextual and document review, teacher and student questionnaires, and in-depth interviews, data were gathered on participant perspectives on the following key areas of research interest: concepts of flexible learning; the flexible learning environment; the role of the teacher; the role of the learner; methods of communication; concepts of information; methods of presenting information; using information resources and services; the role of the librarian; concepts of learning; the learning process; and the relationships between information, learning and knowledge.  Interview data were analysed using the constant comparative method to identify conceptual categories and higher-level themes within individual cases as well as collectively across all three cases. The main conclusions of the study were that: (1) the ways in which information and learning are conceived are central to understanding information use as part of the learning process; (2) there are a number of identifiable processes or phases involved in using information to learn; (3) the integration of information resources and communication mechanisms is a major benefit of the online learning environment; and (4) the design of the flexible learning environment influences student approaches to learning and the use of information and learning resources. The implications of the study conclusions for library and information services include the need for librarians to develop an understanding of the relationship between information and learning; the need to encourage active engagement with information, qualitative/deep approaches to learning, and critical and interpretative thinking; the need to integrate library resources, services and communication systems into online learning environments; and the need for librarians to develop their roles as collaborative partners with teachers, as guides and facilitators of student learning, as designers of information environments, and as advocates for the incorporation of information resources and services into flexible learning environments. Suggestions for further research include ongoing studies on information conceptualisation and use within flexible learning environments, and a larger scale phenomenographic study of conceptions of information.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible Learning</field><field name="subject">Open Learning</field><field name="subject">Libraries</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">University of Wollongong</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/321</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Navigating the change process: The experience of, and ways forward for, facility managers in the residential aged care industry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The residential aged care industry in Australia has been undergoing change on multiple fronts since the introduction of the Aged Care Act 1997. Some of the sources of this change have been new regulatory systems such as accreditation and certification, concerns about financial viability, problems with recruitment and retention of staff, new models of care and increasing acuity of care provided.  Facility Managers of aged care homes are at the forefront of managing these changes. In spite of their central position within the industry, there has been almost no research on the general role and functions of Facility Managers and even less that focuses on their role in the management of change. Using a constructivist methodology, this study set out to address this lack of research and to develop a range of practical proposals concerning the management of change in the sector. The research questions the study sought to answer were: 1.	How is the role of managing change perceived and understood within the overall role of Facility Managers? 2.	How is the role of managing change approached by Facility Managers? 3.	How do Facility Managers learn to manage change? 4.	Do Facility Managers need to be supported in their efforts to manage change and, if so, how should that support be provided, and by whom?  Data for the project came from one-to-one interviews with two groups: a randomly chosen cross-section of Facility Managers and a purposive sample of senior stakeholders within the sector. Thematic analysis was used to draw out patterns and themes in the interview transcripts, and to develop interpretations and connections to the literature.  The study found that there is not a clear understanding of how the management of change fits into the role of Facility Managers, and that the management of change is an issue that is in the background of management thinking and practice in the sector. The change management aspects of the Facility Manager's role have been largely ignored or taken for granted. This can lead to stress on the individual manager as well as reducing the effectiveness of the change process.  There are many ways that Facility Managers can be better supported in the management of change, and the study presents a number of proposals to help achieve this. These focus on general principles and competencies underlying the management of change, an analytical model of change management, and management development practices supporting the management of change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">residential</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">facility</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/322</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recruitment and age dynamics of Anguilla australis and A. reinhardtii glass eels in the estuaries of New South Wales</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Shortfin eels (Anguilla australis) and longfin eels (A. reinhardtii) are true freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla.  There are many mysteries still unsolved for the freshwater eel lifecycle, such as location of the spawning grounds, conditions that promote metamorphosis from the leptocephalid to glass eel phase, and the mechanisms that affect glass eel recruitment.  In Australia, little is also known about the estuarine habitats of glass eels as they migrate towards freshwater, and the age at which these eels enter estuaries.  Both species are of commercial importance in the estuary fishery where they are caught in eel traps for export.  There is also a small, but potentially lucrative, aquaculture industry for ongrowing glass eels to market demand size.  This thesis investigates the spatial and temporal recruitment of both species of glass eels to estuaries within NSW, the habitats that may be of importance to them as they continue their upstream migration, and the age at which these eels entered the estuaries.  Firstly, a new sampling device needed to be developed since conventional methods to catch glass eels often required constant observation of gear, multiple operators, specific physical site characteristics, and/or were expensive.  The artificial habitat collectors that were developed were then used to sample six estuaries in NSW monthly within one week of the new moon.  Shortfins showed a more consistent and defined recruitment across all sites than longfins, where the peak shortfin recruitment season was from April - August.  Longfins recruited primarily from January - May but often recruited outside of this period.  Five year collections at one of these sites provided important recruitment information.  It appeared that longfins failed to recruit to this site during 2000/01, which could affect commercial catches of this species when they enter the fishery.  The East Australian Current (EAC) probably transports glass eels from spawning sites in the Coral Sea southward to the east coast of Australia but there was no predicted lag time in the recruitment of eels from northern to southern estuaries.  Therefore, it was not possible to predict the timing of recruitment of glass eels in one estuary based on the timing of recruitment in another more northern estuary.  When glass eels enter estuaries their upstream migration is assisted by the night flood tide.  During the ebb tide, glass eels burrow into the substrate and resurface at the next night flood tide.  The eels do not select particular habitats at this time, rather, their location is dictated by the tide.  However, once glass eels reach the estuarine/freshwater interface, they may prefer more complex habitats such as seagrass/macrophytes or rocks/cobbles in which to hide during the day.  At this interface, glass eels undergo a physiological change to adapt to a freshwater existence and this change may take up to a few weeks.  During this time, glass eels commonly enter the water column during the night flood tide and may be able to locate more suitable habitats in which to hide during the day.  The ages of shortfin and longfin glass eels caught in estuaries were examined both spatially and temporally.  As the EAC travels north to south, glass eels recruiting to the southern sites were expected to be older.  However, shortfins that recruited to the northern-most site in this thesis were older than at all other sites while there was no difference in the ages of longfins.  Also, when the ages of longfins that recruited during the main recruitment period were compared to the ages of longfins that recruited outside of this period, there was no difference in ages.  Therefore, the hypothesis that these later recruiting eels may have been caught in an eddy prior to their estuarine arrival has been disproved.  The ages of shortfins that recruited in two separate years were significantly different from each other and may be due to shortfins' ability to detrain more easily from the weaker currents that exist at these recruitment periods.  Conversely, there was no difference in the ages of longfins that recruited in the same month during three separate years.  The estimated hatch dates for shortfins was estimated at October to January, while for longfins, estimated hatch time was July to September for eels that recruited during the peak recruitment period.  For longfins that recruited outside of the main recruitment period, estimated hatch times were from December to February.  It is unknown, however, whether longfins have an extended spawning period, or whether silver eels arrived at the spawning grounds later and thus produced later arriving longfins.  Continuous monitoring of glass eel recruitment to estuaries is necessary to determine whether there are long term declines in the recruitment of Australian eels similar to the declines recently observed for eels in Europe and Asia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eels</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">anguilla</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/323</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the Australian Position in International Fashion Design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Success in fashion design is important both in its own right and because it has positive influences on the culture of a country and because of the favourable ramifications it can have across many unrelated industries. This dissertation investigates the Australian fashion design industry and asks whether there is a place for a semi-autonomous industry regulator of the kind found in other countries. France is a natural choice as a model because on the one hand it has the most success and enjoys the highest prestige in international fashion design, and on the other it has a well-developed support and accreditation structure, the Federation Francaise de la Couture, du Fret-a-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode. The Federation oversees the whole process, promoting and protecting innovation in the industry and laying down the criteria used in fashion accreditation. These observations led to the question, if a parallel fashion designers' organization were introduced in Australia, what are the chances it would be suitable and effective? To answer this question, interviews were conducted in Australia and in three European countries. The major systematic enquiry was based on a sample of 48 local industry people in key positions in media, commerce and education, who were encouraged to describe and evaluate the industry and to supply answers to a systematic survey document. Candour was promoted by the anonymity of the survey process. The major outcome in terms of evaluation of the industry was that for historical and structural reasons Australian fashion design is not characterized by a high volume of original work. Consequently it is not having much impact internationally and the upper echelons are not providing the basis for downward diffusion of ideas. If the standard (French) classification were applied to Australia, the bulk of the labels would be categorized at the lower end of the scale. The informants provided a strong consensus regarding the nature of the shortfalls including the undue emphasis given to derivative design, the lack of special support for young talent and the low priority given to the synergy between art and high quality craftsmanship. There was agreement that Australian fashion designers should not focus on product just for local consumers, because fashion in clothing is not central to the minds of the average Australian as it is for example in European countries. Fashion designers might be wise to exploit the position of Australia on the edge of the Asian subcontinent and the pool of potential design talent from other countries within the Australian population. By drawing from the new aesthetics emerging in Australia's pluralistic society, designers could easily be at the cutting edge internationally. They might showcase their work at overseas venues, although not necessarily, in the first instance, in countries like France. Although a full-scale federation-type organization might fail for want of a solid innovative industry upon which it might be based, a limited version of such a controlling body could well succeed. Its task would he to steer new directions in education which develops a pool of creative talent through master classes which focus on understanding original design, the importance of the manual aspect in design and the mechanisms of, and rewards stemming from diffusion. Sponsorship should be granted to endeavours by a collective of such talent to showcase designs abroad. Government funds should be redirected away from the promotion of a generic product to a fashion-designing paradigm emphasizing 'designer handwriting' as the value-added aspect. In addition to exploring these issues, this dissertation provides reflections on the nature of the design process and suggests ways in which fashion design and fashion design education might move to revitalize the industry.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fashion Designers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Costume</field><field name="subject">Clothing and Dress</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/324</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young, Competent Internet-Users: A theory based profile</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis presents a qualitative case study of the skills and characteristics of five competent Internet users aged between 10 and 13 years as they engage in Internet activities reflective of their day -to-day use of this culturally valued cognitive tool. The thesis focuses on their learning during these activities and describes the educational profiles of these young learners.  To uncover and more fully understand the learning experiences of young, competent Internet users an integrated theoretical framework was established. Specifically, relevant components of Situated Cognition, Distributed Cognition and Activity Theory, combined with understandings from several cognitive theories developed my understanding of the Internet -mediated learning environment. This integrated theoretical framework resulted in an Internet -Mediated Learning Model which has enabled a holistic understanding of this complex learning sys tem. This model identifies the three major components making up the Internet -mediated learning system: individual, mediating tool (the Internet) and society, and acknowledges the intertwined relationship between these three elements.  The Internet -Mediated Learning Model considers the cognitive processing capabilities and active participation of the individual; the design features and distributive properties of the Internet; and the transmission of social knowledge and participation in local and global communities afforded by Internet -mediated activity.  The integrated theoretical framework was also instrumental in the research design of this study. Most importantly, as a result of the theoretical stance underpinning the study it was deemed appropriate to allow the participants to engage in Internet mediated activity which was reflective of their day -to-day use of this tool, that is, authentic activity.  The data were collected in two distinct phases using four research methods: questionnaire, observations, think -aloud protocols and follow -up interviews. In the first phase a questionnaire, which included a practical component, was developed to ensure the selection of participants who were competent Internet users. Each participant then chose their own Internet -mediated activity in which to participate. Whilst the participants independently completed this activity they were observed and asked to think -aloud. In the second phase, after analysis of the initial data, a follow -up interview was   conducted to further explore some of the issues which emerged from the first phase of data collection. This interview also included a practical component using the Internet.  Analysis of the data resulted in a profile of the young, competent Internet -user. This profile revealed learning characteristics and skills of the user captured in three broad areas which, for this study, have been titled: Participant Citizen, Tool -Mediated Citizen and Adaptive Citizen.  The Participant Citizen captures the skills and knowledge being developed during Internet -mediated activity which relate to transmission of social knowledge and practices and which enable Internet -users to participate in local and global communities. The Tool -Mediated Citizen uncovers learning related to the design features of the Internet and considers the distributive properties of the tool. The Adapative Citizen reveals learner characteristics which enable Internet -users to manage and negotiate the Internet -mediated environment.  Taken together, the Internet -Mediated Learning Model and profile of the young, competent Internet -user provide an in -depth understanding of learning in this unique and complex environment. This study highlights the value in reconsidering the learner skills and characteristics relevant to current and future generations and questioning our application of preconceived notions of learning to the new and relatively unexplored Internet -mediated learning environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/325</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hermeneutic phenomenological study of the lived experience of parenting a child with autism.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">It was identified that there was little published research into the lived experience of parenting a child with autism that utilised a qualitative approach. There was a paucity of material in the literature, beyond single parent accounts, for a nurse to turn to develop a beginning understanding of the experience. There was also little for a parent to compare their own experience with. This study of the lived experience of parenting a child with autism provides an exploration of the experience within the framework of a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Initially nine parents were interviewed and the resulting transcripts analysed. This analysis was taken to four focus groups to allow the parent's voice to remain active in the refinement of the analysis. The parents reported a strong resonance with the analysis and the discussion fell silent. The experience identified was not that of a series of activities but profound changes to the self of the parent. This is considered in the discussion in the light of the existential challenge to the parent's being posed by the demands of parenting a child with autism.

Due to the complex nature of cement constituents, there is currently no reliable method to quantitatively determine the composition of cement. Partly this arises from the fact that the crystal structure of the main component of cement, tricalcium silicate, has not been fully determined. There has been an increase in the use of Rietveld refinement of powder diffraction data for the analysis of cement in recent years. The method has emerged as a valuable tool for the quantitative determination of the composition of cement. A further advantage of the method is its ability to refine complex crystal structures, such as tricalcium silicate. Despite the increased application of this method, few publications exist concerning the evaluation or improvement of the method for the purpose of cement analysis. In this work, the Rietveld method has been critically investigated as a tool for the identification and quantification of the different phases in cement clinker. Laboratory X-ray, synchrotron, neutron, and combined diffraction data are all used in the investigations. For the first time, comparisons of analysis results using various sources are made, rather than comparing the results from various methods. Inconsistencies in the results were found, and their causes were investigated and identified. The reliability of this method was shown to be dependent on the quality of the diffraction data, both in terms of the counting statistics and the resolution, and on the ability of the structures used in the Rietveld model to describe the phases in the sample. The only previously existing structural model for triclinic tricalcium silicate is shown, in this work, inadequate as a description of the form found in cement. Consequently, the triclinic crystal structures of tricalcium silicate were re-investigated. Using synchrotron powder diffraction data, the lattice dynamics during the T1-T2 transition were observed in detail for the first time. Superstructure reflections were observed for the two structures. The first model for the average sub-structure of the T2 form is presented. Structural modulation in the T1 form was re-investigated. The parent sub-structure, suitable for Rietveld refinement, corresponding modulation wave-vector, and superspace group of the superstructure, were identified.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cement composites</field><field name="subject">Cement clinkers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/328</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction of Drug Resistance and Differentiation in Human Leukaemia Cell Lines</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The ability of low, clinically relevant levels of the chemotherapeutic drugs epirubicin and vinblastine to induce drug resistance was examined in the K562. U937, KG-la and HEL human leukaemia cell lines. Treatment with epirubicin and vinblastine induced the MDR phenotype and P-glycoprotein expression in K562 and U937 cells. However this treatment had no effect on drug resistance in the P-glycoprotein expressing KG-la and HEL cells. In the U937 cells, drug resistant cells were not only MDR but were also resistant to other drugs including cisplatinum and chlorambucil which are not normally associated with MDR. The drug resistant U937 sublines were also sensitised to doxorubicin, cisplatinum and chlorambucil by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), suggesting that glutathione-related mechanisms also contributed to resistance in these sublines. The U937 sublines also had an increased DNA content and an increased ability to recover from DNA damage, as determined by cell cycle analysis, indicating that the broad cross-resistance exhibited by these cells was due to the co-existence of multiple resistance mechanisms. Drug treatment induced changes in expression of differentiation associated antigens in all four cell lines. Treatment with inducers of differentiation (TPA, sodium butyrate, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF). Treatment of K562 and K562/E15B cells with TPA induced megakaryocytic differentiation, with increases in drug resistance, and increased P-glycoprotein expression in the K562/E15B subline. TPA induced monocytic differentiation in the U937 cells but not the U937/EIS subline, with increased P-glycoprotein expression and function in the U937/E15 cells but not the U937 cells. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited differentiation in these cell lines, but did not inhibit increases in P-glycoprotein expression, suggesting drug resistance was not mediated by PKC. Sodium butyrate induced erythroid differentiation, and increased P-glycoprotein expression in the K562/E15B cells. However at a higher concentration (15 mM) this was not accompanied by increased drug resistance. Granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not induce differentiation in the K562 cells or K562/E15B subline, although the K562/E15B cells became more drug resistant after treatment with GM-CSF. Treatment with GM-CSF induced differentiation in the U937/E15 subline but did not change drug resistance in either the U937 cells or the U937/EI5 subline. Therefore the P-glycoprotein expressing K562/E15B and U937/E15 sublines were more responsive to inducers of differentiation than the parental cell lines. Induction of differentiation therefore induced increases in P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance, suggesting that expression of P-glycoprotein or a multidrug resistance phenotype was associated with differentiation.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance</field><field name="subject">cancer cells</field><field name="subject">leukemia</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/331</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telecommuting: current status, future direction</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Telecommuting is a method of work which substitutes telecommunications and technology for the daily journey to, and home from work. Instead of travelling to a central workplace telecommuters work from home or a specially established centre close to their home. The incidence of telecommuting is increasing throughout the world. An extensive search for information on the telecommuting phenomenon reveals that most developed countries in the world have some level of participation in telecommuting. The United States of America certainly leads the way in terms of the numbers of participation and especially the information available. Information on the Australian situation has been difficult to find. It would appear that not many organizations have formal plans or policies regarding telecommuting. Much of the information available for the Australian situation is concerned with the Rural Telecentres programme that whilst not strictly developed for the purposes of telecommuting does provide facilities which can be used by organizations and telecommuters. Based on the reports available telecommuting is a popular choice for many workers. Telecommuters report benefits associated with lifestyle choices and increased work productivity due to lowered stress levels and choices about working hours. Telecommuting has also associated problems for telecommuters varying from being able to set aside a suitably equipped environment at home to concerns about isolation and missed career opportunities. For organizations the benefits also are many including increased productivity, cost savings and worker satisfaction. The problems facing organizations need careful planning to overcome. Organizations have to deal with managerial issues, potential problems associated with insurance and legal exposure, and security concerns. Organizations need to establish formal policy regarding telecommuting in order to address these concerns. Telecommuting has the potential to impact on travel and transport habits and infrastructures. It has the potential to impact positively on the environment by reducing vehicle emissions. Telecommuting, by making work location independent has the potential to affect suburban and rural communities. Issues associated with telecommuting need to be further researched in order to have the information to plan and manage this phenomenon effectively. There is difficulty obtaining information on the Australian experience, even though Australia would be ideally suited due to its geographical isolation to take advantage of the possible benefits.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommuting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/332</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Structure of Cliff-Top Coastal Heathlands in Botany Bay National Park, Sydney</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis examines community structure of cliff-top coastal heathlands in Botany Bay National Park, Sydney. Community properties of floristic composition, structure and species richness are investigated. This investigation is made in order to assess the justification for contemporary pre-emphasis in local studies on individual community properties. It is also made in order to assess the relative and independent contributions of individual properties to variance in overall community structure. It is also made in order to assess the relative utility of multi-property classifications in summarising community structure of cliff-top coastal heathlands.  First, the presence of determinable structure in each property is assessed through multivariate classification of respective data sets. Secondly, a new model of community structure is developed in which the hypothesis that community structure is a function of common (shared) and independent (unique) variance in each of the three properties is assessed. This is achieved through application of variance partitioning using correspondence analysis techniques. Thirdly, a matrix combining variance in all three properties is classified. This classification is compared with those of individual properties in order to assess the hypothesis that more ecologically cohesive classifications than those of single properties are obtainable. The ecological significance (environmental relativity) of all classifications and variance components is assessed through examination of relationships with variance in 20 environmental factors which encompass variation in maritime factors, soil physical factors, soil nutrition factors and effects of time since fire. Classifications of individual properties showed the presence of determinable structure in each. Eleven floristic complexes, nine structural complexes and eighteen species richness complexes were recognised. Nineteen community complexes were recognised from the classification of the combined property matrix. All complexes were shown to differ significantly with respect to multiple environmental factors. Variance partitioning showed the presence of both independent and common variance components with respect to properties compared pairwise. These were all shown to differ in magnitude. Examination of environmental correlates showed ecological differentiation of all properties and most variance components. Maritime and fire factors provide a major axis of environmental differentiation for most properties and variance components. A second major axis was resolved with respect to physical soil factors. With the exception of variance in species richness, major soil nutrients were generally of secondary importance to community structure. Low soil nutrients may demarcate heathlands from other vegetation types. However, this study shows elevated importance of other major areas of environment for community structure within cliff-top coastal heathlands. Comparisons of environmental homogeneity characteristics between all classification systems showed the classification of the combined property matrix to be more ecologically robust than those of structure or species richness. Homogeneity characteristics of the combined classification remained statistically inseparable from that of floristic composition. However, studies provided some evidence suggesting greater robustness of the combined classification with regard to fine-scale variance in community structure. This thesis shows that variance in all major community properties of the studied vegetation to be of ecological significance. It also shows that this significance is differential with respect to properties and their variance components. Pre-emphasis on individual properties in syntheses of local systems thus involves the loss of ecological information. I thus conclude that if adequate ecological syntheses of cliff-top coastal heathlands are to be obtained which are appropriate to their scale of distribution and functioning in the Sydney area then inclusion of attributes of multiple properties is required. Equally, multiple sources of environmental variation need to be examined.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heathlands -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="subject">-National parks and reserves -- New South Wales -- Botany Bay Region</field><field name="subject">Botany Bay Region (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/333</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity of maternal care in a community setting: a randomised controlled trial using the Zelen design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research investigated a new community-based model of continuity of care provided collaboratively by a small team of midwives and obstetricians (St George Outreach Maternity Project or STOMP). The study considered whether STOMP improved maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes, resulted in a better experience for women and could be implemented within the current resources of a public teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. A randomised controlled trial using a Zelen design was used to compare the STOMP model with standard care. One thousand and eighty-nine women were randomly allocated to either the STOMP model or standard hospital-based care. The Zelen design was used to increase the participation of women from non-English speaking backgrounds and to reduce disappointment bias in women allocated to the control group.  The results suggest that the model of community-based continuity of care is associated with a lower caesarean section rate, more positive experiences for women and costs less than standard care. There were no differences in the number of medical complications experienced in either group, but more women in the control group were admitted to hospital during the antenatal period. There were four perinatal deaths in each group. Women in the STOMP group reported a higher quality of antenatal care compared with the control group. Women in the STOMP group also reported that the community-based service was accessible and convenient with reduced waiting times for appointments. Women in the STOMP group were more likely to have received adequate information about labour, birth and the postnatal period and felt more 'in control' during labour compared with the control group. Women from both groups reported problems with postnatal care, particularly when provided in the hospital. The study also examined the impact of the STOMP model on women from Chinese and Arabic-speaking backgrounds. The STOMP model appeared to reduce the rate of elective and emergency caesarean section in Chinese-speaking women compared with English-speaking women. Small numbers precluded statistical analysis on these data so the results must be interpreted with caution. Women from Chinese-speaking  backgrounds reported receiving insufficient information. The STOMP model improved the provision of information, however Chinese-speaking women still reported inferior experiences. There were also differences in the method of infant feeding. The results indicate that the model provides effective, cost efficient and satisfying maternity care. New models of maternity care can be implemented within current resources when organisations have a strong commitment to change.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitals</field><field name="subject">maternity services</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/334</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Digital Theses Program and the Theory of Disruptive Technologies : A case study</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Theory of Disruptive Technologies put forward by Clayton Christensen in 1997 has attracted significant attention.

This doctorate examines the lack of recognition of midwifery as an autonomous profession and its consequential invisibility in Australian maternity care.Despite the significant amount of evidence that continues to accumulate to support the expansion of midwifery models of care, such changes have not been widespread in Australia. An examination of international, national and local health policy and strategic direction in maternity services, together with a critique of contemporary Australian midwifery and the role of the midwife within the public health system, provide the rationale and context for the study. The 'case' for introducing improved systems and models of maternity care is developed with regard to the evidence for increasing the utilisation of midwifery. The doctorate argues for greater visibility and recognition of midwifery in Australia with a focus on the role of midwifery leadership and its potential to improve collaboration. A number of case studies report experiences and insights of leadership and collaboration across different contexts: clinical practice, organisation of health services and health policy leadership in maternity services. The result is a comprehensive understanding of the reasons for the lack of visibility of midwifery and the potential costs of such a situation continuing. The exploration of this situation highlights the barriers to recognising and acknowledging midwifery itself.  Attention is drawn to the continuing lack of voice and visible leadership in Australian midwifery, with midwives being absent from decision-making in situations whereothers, predominantly nurses and doctors, speak 'for' them. This work examines the barriers to midwives forming alliances and working to influence government agendas at the social, organisational and political level. Exploration of the power structures and hierarchical constraints that exist reveals particular barriers and highlights what is needed to address the impending decline of the profession in Australia. The enhanced capacity that midwives would experience if their work were to be understood, recognised and valued in the provision of maternity services in Australia, is postulated through the development of a construct called 'professional capital'. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives, it is argued that the notion of 'professional capital' is dependent on a strategy of focused and deliberate leadership and collaboration within maternity services and the creation of positive social networks and affiliations amongst midwives. Professional capital would enable greater visibility and recognition of midwifery and a more effective midwifery contribution to maternity services. It is suggested that improved professional and societal recognition will ultimately enhance the professional performance and self image of midwives. Such developments will enable new and effective ways of supporting and strengthening inter-professional relationships and systems of care that will, in the long term, improve the outcomes and experiences of women who access maternity services.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Practice</field><field name="subject">Professional Relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/339</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Continuously Variable Unit on Powertrain Dynamics</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis studies the dynamic model and simulation of a Half-Toroidal (HT) type Continuously Variable Unit (CVU) integrated into a conventional powertrain.  A simplified parametric model of a HT-CVU is constructed using Finite Element Method (FEM) in which the continuous variable speed unit is discretized into lumped masses, spring and damper elements. Linearized Finite Elements (FE) have been used to model the contacts between the toroids and rollers. The phenomenon of slip and spin associated with the rolling-slipping contacts of the traction drives are modelled kinematically. All Finite Elements including the CVU model are integrated into the complete powertrain system.  Free Vibration Analysis (FVA) of the multi degree of freedom system is carried out for torsional vibration for High Gear (HGR) and Low Gear Ratio (LGR) conditions. Further, FVA is carried out with a lock-up clutch engaged at high speed range. The results of the FVA indicates significant changes in natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes for both HGR and LGR condition with a change in HT-CVU gear ratios. Change in natural frequencies and mode shapes for both HGR and LGR conditions are also observed for varying contact torsional stiffness. The change is significant till a certain value of contact torsional stiffness. Further increase in contact torsional stiffness within the HT-CVU does not affect the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes significantly. The results of the modal analysis carried out for a HT-CVU integrated powertrain with a lock-up clutch engaged at high speed range illustrates the ability of the lock-up clutch to simultaneously suspend engine and roller element excitation. However, for certain natural frequencies the modal analysis of the integrated powertrain system indicates suspension of engine and input toroid but increased excitation for the roller element of the HT-CVU.  The transient dynamic analysis is carried out to understand the behaviour of the CVU integrated into the complete powertrain and to identify and possibly correct potential problems associated with the system. The simulation is carried out for constant and variable throttle conditions for the powertrain with and without a lock up clutch engaged at high speed ranges. A piecewise curved gear ratio map is assumed for all conditions. All analyses are carried out for throttle 'tip-in' condition. The results of the transient dynamic analysis indicate that the transient responses of input and output rollers of the HT-CVU exist when clutch change occurs during vehicle acceleration period from stand still condition. The clutch change also leads to disturbances in the HT-CVU output torque to driveline and in vehicle speed. This leads to imperfect drive feel for the driver. The simulated vehicle velocity indicates powerful acceleration characteristics of the HT-CVU integrated powertrain. Engine harmonics is modelled as a rich collection of various forcing frequencies. These frequencies impress on the response of both the roller and output toroid and are observed in the simulation.  Stability analysis is carried out on the powertrain to understand the effect of damping in the tyres and damping within the HT-CVU on the stability of the powertrain. Severe or even unstable response of the HT-CVU takes place if the damping in the HT-CVU and/or the tyres is insufficient during the initial acceleration period and later after the clutch change occurs and when the vehicle is at high speeds. The results of the stability analysis lead us to reason with confidence that the tyre and HT-CVU damping have an effect on the dynamic characteristics and the stability of the system. The response of the powertrain becomes stable when a lock-up clutch is applied over the high speed ranges even if the damping in the tyres remains insufficient. The modal damping ratios for stable and unstable conditions are also discussed. Future investigations need to be carried out in order to understand in depth the fluid-metal interaction in the HT-CVU. This can be achieved by modelling in non-linear drag torque which would act on the HT-CVU elements.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Transmission Devices</field><field name="subject">Automatic</field><field name="subject">Power Trains</field><field name="subject">Design and Construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/340</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The right to leave and return and Chinese Migration Law</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Right to leave and return (RLR) has been affirmed as a fundamental human right in several international instruments. While being a fundamental human right, each State has the sovereign right to regulate RLR in accordance with its own laws. The regulation of RLR, however, is not only an attribute of sovereignty but an issue with important political, economic and security implications for the State. Given its significance, it is understandable and desirable that States regulate RLR. The regulation must however take account of both the interests of the State and the human rights dimension of the right. This is an issue of balance. In the case of China, the country's communist political system has significantly affected the development of RLR and the country's approach to it. As a rule China's approach is restrictive. As part of its reform and 'opening up' policies, China has embarked on a range of reforms to liberalise RLR, but the reforms lack cohesion and focus, and remain restrictive. Given its peculiar past and complex social and economic conditions, China may have some justifications for its approach, but on balance, has more to gain from adopting a more liberal approach. The issue of RLR in China is crucial both for the future of China, and for development of RLR in the world.  China's current policy's on RLR still reflects a closed culture. A more open policy is not only consistent with international human rights norms, but also a useful infrastructure for the country's place in the global economy. Great achievements over the last 25 years and encouraging developmental trends demand acceleration of reforms to protect RLR in China. A careful and well-coordinated migration strategy with a well-defined RLR focus could enhance China's economic progress as well as its international human rights image. When designing the reform strategy, the balance of the Western experience and Chinese realities needs to be finely kept.  This thesis will explore the Chinese regulatory regime governing RLR to determine its consistency with international standards. The thesis is divided into 15 chapters. It investigates RLR in international migration law and practice; analyses RLR in the context of China, and identifies its driving factors; investigates the conditions and practical concerns relevant to the protection of RLR; and concludes with recommendations on how the Chinese regulatory regime governing RLR can be improved.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">freedom</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/341</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical relationships in waters and sediments of some urban streams, with particular reference to heavy metals and phosphorus</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Warwick Jay</field><field name="description">This thesis describes two studies of the chemistry of freshwater streams in the Sydney basin. The first was a survey of 86 waterways, sampled under low conditions. Samples were generally low in salinity, soft, of poor buffering capacity and dominated by sodium and chloride. C0-dominance by calcium, magnesium and (bi)carbonate occured in a number of particular cases. Multivariate analyses indicated three groups, separated primarily by levels of dissolved nutrients, trace metals, turbidity and colour. Groupings were associated strongly with the type of catchment. Streams in areas relatively unaffected by human influence had notable uniformity in chemistry, while those from developed catchments were varied. Heavy metal contamination was relatavely low, although a few of the samples displayed inordinately large levels of one or more metals. In such cases the more extreme measurements of phosphorus and nitrogen were also seen. The findings were consistant with occasional or localised elevation of contaminant levels. The second study invloved monitoring of three Hawkesbury Sandstone streams. Sampling of surface waters, interstial waters and sediments was performing at irregular intervals over a two year period at three stations within each site. The streams predominantly existed under low conditions and showed similar major ion chemistries to the majority of the survey samples. Levels of calcium and total carbonate, plus heavy metals and nutrients were generally higher in the urbanised creeks, comapred to the reference strema. During a heavy storm, high levels of nutrients, suspended solids and colour were detected in all surface waters at peak-flow, as well as alkaline pH, oxidising redox, and reduced conductivity, alkalinity and hardness. The sandy sediments were characterised by very low levels of organic matter and cation exchange capacity. Sequential extractions identified that the sums of secondary phase lead, zinc and copper were over nine, four and two times that of the corresponding residual, respectively. Greatest proportions of zinc and lead were associated with coatings of iron and maganese oxides, or coarse waste particles. Copper was preferentially associated with organic matter. Concentration gradients between interstitial and surface waters were rare and release of sedimentary constituents should occur from the upper-most particulates. Poor water and sediment qualities were often observed in the urban sites. Poor water quality was also seen on occassion in the reference stream. However, since poor sediment quality was not detected at those times and interstitial waters for all sites displayed high within-site variability, surface waters were considered the most reliable short-term indicator of condition for Hawkesbury Sandstone streams. Multidimensional scaling showed that all streams had distinct water and sediment chemistries. High levels of temporal and spatial variability were apparant within the urbanised sites - particularly in interstitial waters - mostly due to concentrations of heavy metals, phosphorus and suspended solids. Seasonal differences were detected, but only in terms of the level of variability between summer and winter samples.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace elements.</field><field name="subject">Water.</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff.</field><field name="subject">Pollution.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/361</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the Internet on English language teaching: a case study at a Thai Rajabhat University.</field><field name="creator">Noytim, Usa</field><field name="description">This research was conducted in the English Department of a provincial Thai university.

The research was located in Central Thailand at Nakhon Pathom Rajabhat University (NPRU), my own work place. Here I investigated students&#8217; Internet practices and the potential offered by one English language program that incorporated use of the Internet. My focus on this one program enabled me to address questions about my own teaching practices, and about the implications of incorporating the Internet for program design and teaching. The research itself was conducted in two stages. Stage One was an ethnographic investigation of students&#8217; current Internet practices, both in and out of University. Outcomes from Stage One then informed the development of an English language program that incorporated extensive use of the Internet. This program was implemented and evaluated in Stage Two of the research. Outcomes from Stage One of the research revealed that the University students had low overall levels of Internet use, low levels of computer and Internet skills, but generally high levels of interest and enthusiasm, and a belief that the Internet could play a positive role in supporting English language learning. Outcomes from Stage Two confirmed that the Internet was potentially a powerful resource for teaching English. However, they also showed that if the Internet was incorporated fully into a program, rather than simply tacked onto a traditional program, then a major rethinking of program design and pedagogical practices was necessary. The implications of such changes in program design and teaching are addressed in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="subject">Thailand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/384</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aesthetics and hyper/aesthetics: rethinking the senses in contemporary media contexts.</field><field name="creator">Swalwell, Melanie</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the escalation of interest in the senses, across a range of media technological contexts, dating from the mid 1990s. Much of this discourse has focussed on the experiential, particularly intense, multisensory experience of the present. As there are numerous discourses on the senses, technology and affect individually, my concern is to examine some of the intersections between these, in order to reconsider the contemporary significance of aesthetics in media contexts. I develop a &#8216;hyper/aesthetic&#8217; approach to try to think about aesthetic relations with technology in a nuanced way, opening up a space from which to investigate a variety of relations with technology. Walter Benjamin&#8217;s work on the senses and modern technology is useful in this, as is that of two of his commentators, Susan BuckMorss and Miriam Hansen. In providing the outlines of a hyper/aesthetic approach in this thesis, I am, in particular, seeking to complexify understandings of audience reception and meaningmaking, to return some ambivalence to conceptions of the sensory encounter with technology. Hyper/aesthetics is a term that draws together ambivalence, doubling, virtuality, unfamiliarity, innervation, and moving beyond, all concepts that are relevant to the senses and subjectivity. In close readings of case studies drawn from the areas of advertising, computer gaming practices, and new media art, I argue that as well as critiquing their claims to newness, it is also important to attend to the ways in which particular relations with technology exceed or refuse the logic of instrumentality. In particular, these cases consider the emerging aesthetic experiences that technologies of computer gaming and new media art facilitate, and the new subjective possibilities that follow from each. Approaching these studies hyper/aesthetically enables me to go beyond other accounts in appreciating the more experimental character of some of these relations with technology. I particularly focus on the effects and affects generated by encounters with the unfamiliar, including that which is considered strange, &#8216;unnatural&#8217; or &#8216;inhuman&#8217;, and critically appraise the significance of encounters such as these for the manner in which subjectivity is conceived.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Senses.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/386</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technologies transforming academics: academic identity and online teaching.</field><field name="creator">McShane, Kim</field><field name="description">As the discourses of the &#8220;technological imperative&#8221; and student-centred learning have gained momentum in university teaching and learning, one way for the lecturer to signal excellence has been to adopt the flexible, student-centred practices of online teaching. This thesis investigates academics&#8217; insights and experiences about their changing teacher identities in the context of being, or becoming, a facilitator of online student learning. This was an empirical research project, a collective case study that explored the teaching experiences of twelve university lecturers in two Australian universities who taught online, or were making the move online. Primary research data were drawn from semi-structured conversations with the lecturers, online teaching artefacts and email communications. The interpretative analysis was organised according to three overlapping lecturer identities: the teaching metaphors of performance, care and creative direction. From the perspective of each metaphor position, the move to becoming a facilitator of blended learning was uneasy. The performer/carer/director lecturer struggled to entertain, care and intervene in familiar ways in asynchronous, computer-mediated communication. Online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer was ignored by students, and became instead a helpless and highly reflexive bystander to students&#8217; learning. The findings suggest that the teaching values and practices of the performing/caring/directing lecturer, in particular lecturer-student responsiveness and reciprocity, do not adapt to online pedagogies. Indeed, blended learning establishes the conditions for a new moral order in university education, with the move to online facilitation best understood as a move to management-centred regulation of teaching and student learning. And so, overlooked in higher education policy and research, and ignored by her students online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer is under erasure, at the same time as the work of the facilitator is being archived.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="subject">Academics.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Lecturer.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/391</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalable and cost-effective framework for continuous media-on-demand.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dang Nam Chi</field><field name="description">This dissertation was motivated by the exponential growth in bandwidth capacity of the Internet, coupled with the immense growth of broadband adoption by the public. This has led to the development of a wide variety of new online services. Chief amongst the emerging applications is the delivery of multimedia contents to the end users via the network on-demand. It is the &#8220;on-demand&#8221; aspect that has led to problems which, despite the advances in hardware technology and network capacity, have hampered wide scale adoption of multimedia delivery. The focus of this dissertation was to address these problems, namely: scalability, cost-effectiveness, and network quality of service for timely presentation of multimedia contents. We proposed an architecture, which we referred to as &#8220;Delayed-Multicast&#8221;, to address the scalability problem. The new architecture introduced buffers within the network to reduce demands on core network bandwidth and server load. A feasibility study of the architecture was conducted through the use of a prototype. It was found that such a system is within reach by demonstrating the prototype using cheap, common-of-the-shelf (COTS) components, and with help of freely available system software such Linux with real-time support. The introduction of buffers within the network led to the requirement of how to minimize buffer space. We developed an optimal algorithm for allocating buffer space in a single level caching layout (i.e. only one buffer in the transmission path from the server to the end user). For the case of multi-levels network caching, we thoroughly examined different optimization problems from an algorithmic perspective. These problems included how to minimize total system memory, and minimize the maximum memory used per node. We proved that determining the optimal buffer allocation in many of these iv v cases is an NP-complete problem. Consequently, we developed heuristics to handle multi-level caching and showed through simulations that the heuristics greatly help in minimizing buffer space and network bandwidth requirement. An important aspect of the heuristics was how to handle the case when the arrival times of client requests were not known a priori. For these &#8220;online&#8221; problems we also proposed heuristics that can significantly reduce overall system resource requirements. If the cost of buffer space was also taken into account along with the cost of network bandwidth, a different optimization problem was how to minimize the total system cost. Here, we also proposed heuristics, which in simulations show that the total system cost can be significantly reduced. Besides the problems associated with resource allocation, in terms of buffer space and bandwidth, we also examined the problem of how to provision the necessary network quality of service on-demand. Most current networks rely on best-effort delivery which is ill suited for the delivery of multimedia traffic. We proposed a solution which relied on the use of a programmable network plane, that is present in many current routers, to dynamically alter the priority of flows within the network in real-time. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the flow prioritization on an actual Nortel router. Finally, we examined the problem of how to admit and achieve fair bandwidth allocation for the end-users within a Differentiated Service (DiffServ) network. Diff- Serv is an IETF standard that aims to provide a &#8220;better than best-effort&#8221; network in a scalable manner, and is used widely, especially within the same autonomous domain for prioritization different classes of traffic. However, there are open problems on how to provide fair bandwidth allocation amongst competing flows. We proposed an edge-aware resource discovery loop, which as the name suggests, sent packets to gather information about the internal states of the core network. With this information, we proposed a price-based admission control algorithm for use within the DiffServ network that would allow fair admission, effective congestion control, and fair bandwidth allocation amongst different traffic flows.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streaming.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication.</field><field name="subject">Data transmission.</field><field name="subject">Interactive.</field><field name="subject">Multimedia.</field><field name="subject">Bandwidth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/392</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corpus modificatus: transmutational belonging and posthuman becoming.</field><field name="creator">Massie, Raya</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.
